Prague, capital of the Czech Republic and home to 1.3 million people. A wonderful place, that offers tourists from all over the world the chance to discover. From cultinary adventures over historic sites to cultural exhibits, Prague is offering from a wide spectrum of activities. So most likely, the challenge will be what acitivity you will decide for during your stay. I went there this year in May 2023 for about a week. This guide is to help you make a more sophisticated choice. To get an overview of the city, we need to talk about the city layout first.
Prague, or Praha in Czech, consists of several zones, ranging from Zone 1 to 22. The city center is in Praha 1 and the surrounding zones. Most of the things that I did have been in Zone 1, 2, 5 and 6. You can easily travel through these zones with the metro system or walk. So I’d recommend to get an accomodation in one of these zones for convenience. If you haven’t any, I have one recommendation for you.
I recommend to stay with Vladimir, who offers a few rooms on AirBnB in zone 6. You will get the most bang for your buck. The room has access to a kitchen, laundry machine and is located right next to the metro station, which is just 5 minutes to the centre. A perfect headquarter to deal with all the high priority missions during your stay in Prague. If you fancy something more high-end like a hotel, there are plenty of locations to choose from. I suggest you look for a hotel in some of the zones close to the city center.
Great! You have a basic knowledge about the geographics of Prague and hopefully your accomodation is set. Next, let’s check out what we can do. I will introduce the most exciting activities I did during my stay in Prague, and I’m sure, at least one of them will catch your interest. You can get the location of all activities on the map below. The number corresponds to the number besides the activity in this blog. Activity 10 is secret till the end. So let’s not waste time and dive right into it!
If you didn’t go to Wenceslas Square, also called Václavák, then you haven’t been to Prague! It’s the city center and where you will see a huge crowd. It’s a great starting point for any tour, just get off the Metro station Můstek, and you can easily discover cultural sites by foot from Wenceslas Square. I definitely recommend to explore the alleys and site streets by foot, because you can discover all those hidden gems easily. For example the Slight Uncertainty by Czech Sculptor Michal Trpak is just a short walk from Wenceslas Square. It’s located right in front of the Mosaic House. It’s also a great place to exchange money, since you always want to have some cash on you, even though I have noticed that many locals like to pay with credit card.
One of the iconic sites of Prague is the Charles Bridge, spanning across the Vltava, the longest river in the whole country. There will be plenty of people testing the durability of the Charles Bridge, which has been finished in the year 1402, after 45 years of construction: a testimony to medieval construction skills. Walking across the Charles Bridge, you will meet many small souvenir vendors, sculptures and artists. If you find yourself in the lesser town, it brings us right to the next mission: walking up to the Castle.
Walking up from the Malá Strana (english: lesser Town), which starts on the west side of Charles Bridge, you can already see the famous Prague Castle. It’s a huge complex with many historical buildings on its premise. One that needs to be mentioned besides the castle itself is the St. Vitus Cathedral, which can be visited anytime, but it will be free during the official church service on Sundays.
One of my favorite restaurants in Prague has been the U Glaubiců. This restaurant has been there since the 16th century and offers some of the cheapest beers. You can get half liter of beer for around 1.5 $ in 2023. I even met Vladimir (my landlord) here, who is a local. And there was another tourist whom I talked to, that came here everyday to eat their roasted duck. Definitely a great sign. I went there with my dad, check out the image below. Can you see a crazy Person? That’s my dad.
You will have to wait though, since this place is very popular, so it might be best to make a booking or to avoid peak times. I recommend to try any of the local foods, but my favorites are the pork knuckle, the beef tartar and the radish-kraut-salad. After having tried some food in Czech Republic, the food to me feels like a mix of Italian, Barvarian and Austrian cuisine. Meatlovers will be on cloud nine.
Every hour on the hour, the Prague astronomical clock at the Old Town Hall in Prague starts moving. The mechanism is highly complex and has been first built in the 1400th. Figures will show up from the windows. There is also a small skeleton that is ringing a bell, besides other figures, that stand for the sins that humans fall for. Each figure stands for one of the following: narcissism, greed and hedony. The guy with the mirror stands for narcissim. The person with the money bag stands for greed. The person with the instrument stands for hedony. I wouldn’t know this if we didn’t get a tour by my friend Greg. So, if you are interested in some more background knowledge, it might be worthwile getting a tour guide. It is one of the most visited places in Prague and you will surely face a huge crowd.
If you want to see some cute furballs, you can head to Libeňský and Střelecký islands. These islands are home to Nutria, which belong to the family of mammals. However, as cute as they might be, they are rodents and have brought up the same problems as rats do. They transmit diseases and do damage the infrastructure. They have risen fast in their population count due to oversupply of food. Many tourists love to feed them, but I would highly advocate against it. Watching them and enjoying the view can be just as good.
I could recommend you to go to one of the biggest clubs in Europe, since there is this place in Prague that claims to be the biggest one. The place consists of multiple dance floors, where each floor comes with its own style of music. It’s called Karlovy lázně (in case you want to go anyway). But sometimes, the best things are those that speak for themselves. Similar to a best-selling author, who is the best at marketing and selling his product. That doesn’t mean that the author’s style of writing is best. Same it is with this endeavor and I was lucky to run into it. If you walk in Letna Park during the night, you will find one place, where people set up a rave and come to dance. It’s a great vibe and you will have a great view over Prague.
What is great about Prague is the manifold of Parks that you can discover. There is Letna Park, Folimanka Park or Riegrovy Park. But my favorite park were the Petrin Gardens. You can go there and hike up all the way up to find something that looks like the Czech version of the Eiffeltower in Paris. And when you are up there, you will have a wonderful view down on Prague. You will be able to see most of the sites that I have described above.
The National Technical Museum of Prague is located right besides Letna Park. It’s home to a big collection of airplanes, bicycles and vehicles. It’s great for all tech-fans. There are english descriptions. I’ll leave this to yourself to discover.
My last advice is to just explore the city and take in the great vibes. It’s always an adventure for me to discover a new place. Figure out how to get best from A to B, where to find the best food or discover those hidden gems, that haven’t received too much attention, but are special and interesting to you personally. For myself, I fell in love with those many street art and street sculptures, as e.g. the one below. With this last shot from Prague, I’ll leave you hanging right here.
It’s time to say Ahoj(Czech for Goodbye) for now. I really enjoyed my trip to Prague and am happy to share my experience. Prague is a gem in the center of Europe and a great city to visit. Prague offers defty food, a fascinating historical culture and lots of arts for curious travelers. I hope, you found at least one thing that you want to do during your next trip to Prague. I’d appreciate a virtual hand for that! If you want to stay tuned and discover other travel gems around Europe and the world with me, follow me right here or connect with me on LinkedIn to not miss out on future blogs. I also write about tech, food and some of my other hobbies.

When you think about your top ten places to visit in Europe, which cities come to mind? Maybe wandering around the streets of Paris sounds like a dream come true? Or perhaps sightseeing in the historical city of Rome? Why not enjoy the beautiful beaches Santorini has to offer?
Europe definitely has plenty of great travel destinations, but most people wouldn’t think to visit the city of Prague. Nestled in the Czech Republic, right smack in the middle of Europe, surrounded by Germany, Poland, and Austria, Prague is a city worth visiting at least once during your next trip to Europe, and here’s why:
If you didn’t know, Prague is an undeniably beautiful city. It’s an incredible city with so much culture and history. There is a bridge that connects the Old Town with the Lesser Town (not any less beautiful, however) and everywhere you look, whether it’s the cobblestone strees or the medieval architecture, it’s enough to make anyone fall in love with the city.
Are you a John Lennon fan? There’s a literal wall in Prague dedicated to him. Do you want to see the narrowest street of Prague? Vinárna Čertovka is so narrow it even requires a traffic light to prevent pedestrian traffic jams.
Or perhaps The Metamorphosis is one of your favorite novellas, and you’re a major fan of Franz Kafka? You’d be delighted to know there’s a moving statue of him right outside Quadrio Shopping Centre! If you’re more into chapels and Prague’s rich history, the stained glass of St. Vitus Cathedral is sure to leave you breathless.
I was a broke grad student when I visited Prague. I couldn’t afford to live in the finest hotels or dine at the best restaurants. I did, however, live in a more than sufficient Airbnb for a very reasonable price. Even though Prague is not only the capital, but also the largest city of Czech Republic, it is still affordable for those who don’t have that much to spend, or frankly want to spend that much. You’ll get a lot of bang for your buck; it’ll be enough for the Airbnb, food, and a lot of fun sightseeing, touristy things.
I’m using the term ‘interesting’ because I’m aware that the food may not be for everyone. There’s meat, meat, and more meat. I, for one, enjoyed the food thoroughly, and ate until I was very full every meal. For carnivores, the food option is considered pretty diverse. In addition to chicken, beef, and pork, there’s boar, venison, and even rabbit. I’m personally a big fan of the Goulash, or Guláš, as the Czechs call it. The meat is tender, the potatoes are crispy, and the flavor is rich. To top it all off, there’s plenty of beer and delicious desserts to go along with it.
I remember people didn’t give me weird stares as I walked around the streets of Prague. As a POC, it is not uncommon to be looked at a certain way in Europe. Having traveled a bit in Europe, I’ve had my fair share of strange stares because of my skin color. And trust me, it’s not something that goes unnoticed when you’re on the receiving end. In Prague, however, I felt that people were generally friendly. We were greeted in restaurants, just like our fair-skinned counterparts. It might also be worth mentioning that I had a roommate from Prague, and she was an absolute sweetheart.
There you have it. Five reasons to visit an absolute gem of a city. The next time you go to Europe, don’t sleep on Prague. Hopefully, you’ve been convinced to visit this amazing city nestled right in the heart of Europe. I had a great time in Prague and would go back in a heartbeat. It’s definitely worth Czech-ing out!

Prague, in my opinion, is known by most people and has amazing sound even abroad. I don’t know about overseas, but when I’ve talked to people from different parts of Europe on my travels, everyone knows Prague. But Prague is not only the historical center, but it also has many other amazing parts and that’s why today I would like to show you one cool place to relax after a hard day or to get away from the busy life in the capital of the Czech Republic.
The place is called the Wild Sarka Valley and is located in the north of Prague. It is a gorge between two rocks, with a trail along the Litovický Brook. For me, it is worth staying up there and going to a place called “Nebusicka vyhlidka”. Hustopeče and finally this year the calendar allowed me to go there.
This is the rock from which you can see the rest of the valley and it is the place for sunrise and sunset. It’s relatively quiet except for the planes flying by, as the site is close to the main airport.

This October was pretty awesome for me because I got to try out lots of new things.
The month began with a visit to a country known for its rich history and captivating beauty: the Czech Republic.
I spent four days in the capital city, Prague, and instantly fell in love with it. Prague charmed me with its historical significance, picturesque cobblestone streets, and the vibrant colors of autumn that painted the city.
The iconic Charles Bridge spanning the Vltava River stood as a testament to Prague’s beauty and heritage. Even in the crisp October weather, the city was teeming with tourists.
Let me tell you a little secret — Prague has some of the best and most affordable food in Europe. I’ve been living in Germany for nearly two years, but I’ve never tasted food as good as what I had in the Czech Republic. They really know how to cook. They have this famous dessert called Chimneys, which is like the crunchiest cone you’ve ever had, and they come in all sorts of flavors. And their colorful macarons are giving France a run for its money.
Few reasons that made Prague stand out for me:
1. English Everywhere: The best part? Everyone speaks English, so you don’t have to worry about translations. I know, many of you will think, is this even a criteria! Everyone speaks English nowadays. But trust me, it’s a huge criteriaspecially when you are travelling to non-English speaking countries in Europe.
2. Friendly People: The folks in Czech are super nice. No matter how beautiful a place is, if the people aren’t friendly, it can ruin your experience. But the Czechs have big hearts, helpful and a pinch of humor as well.
3. Rich History: Prague is a fantastic mix of culture, heritage, and history. Don’t forget to catch the military parade at Prague Castle before noon.
4. Food: Obviously, when you’re traveling, you walk a lot, get tired, and want some good food. Prague has you covered with loads of options. They even have healthy stuff like salads, juices, and green shakes for health conscious travellers. My favorite places for a quick bite were Bageterie Boulevard and Salatarie — they have amazing bread.
5. Shopping: We all know how expensive touristy places can be. But in the center of Prague, there’s a shop called ‘The Half Price’ that’s pretty reasonable. You’ll find all sorts of good brands, and even luxury items at affordable prices.
Hidden Gem — Cesky Krumlov: If you’re up for a short journey from Prague, visit Cesky Krumlov. It’s like something out of a fairy tale, and it’s only a few hours away. The town is surrounded by a river in the shape of a ‘C,’ and it has a beautiful castle and cute souvenir shops. You can easily spend 5–6 hours here, just taking in the magic and relaxing.
As a fun fact, Prague’s Astronomical Clock was named Europe’s fourth most hyped place in 2022/23. While it’s undeniably beautiful and impressive, it may be somewhat overhyped compared to its extraordinary popularity.
Tip: If you are visiting any historical places, I will always recommend to book a tour guide. All the sculptures, castles and churches has a great historical significance and a tourist guide can help you to know it and much more. While the famous company’s tours are very expensive, Prague has some local tour guides which are free (technically you have to pay them according to you wish) and very affordable and given by local people. So do check those out.
So, that’s my Prague adventure from a different perspective than your usual travel guide. If you plan to visit this lovely country, definitely check out these places and restaurants, and don’t forget to wear something colorful to match the picturesque surroundings. 🌞
Happy travelling!!!🌻

Starter Pack — Early Morning
After finishing shooting yesterday, I was so exhausted that I threw myself onto the bed as soon as I got back to the accommodation, even before breakfast was served. Before I could fall back asleep, many thoughts crossed my mind. Like the congested bathroom situation during rush hour and the need to care for a friend who struggles to wake up due to oversleeping.
Feeling the urge to escape and start my own exploration of Prague while the others were still asleep, I hastily showered and sneaked out. Fortunately, I’m not the only one enjoying the early morning Prague! Yee-haw! Of course, the purposes of Prague citizens and tourists may differ. Embracing the relatively chilly weather of Prague and the breeze blowing, I aim to start my day with a small cupcake.
This cupcake, with its adorable yet powerful taste, may seem simple in appearance, but the synergy of its ingredients creates a delightful harmony.

When I visited Prague in the summer of 2017 during my 35 day backpacking trip through Spain, Portugal, and central Europe, I was absolutely smitten.
72 hours in Prague gave me (and 2 of my dear friends) a taste of the city. And yes, by taste, I do mean we had a few bites to eat while meandering through the cobblestone streets…
Among all the historical charm, Prague is also a modern and vibrant city full of energy, music, and people who know a good time.
Read on to share in some of my Prague highlights.
Enjoy!
In every new city I visit, I personally love spending 1.5–2 hours of my first morning on a walking tour. It’s the perfect way to get a lay of the land and also learn more about the city’s rich history.
In Europe, Sandeman’s New Europe tours is typically my go-to, simply because they have a good reputation for knowledgable yet charming tour guides who know how to tell a great story. It’s super simple to register a few days before your preferred date and they’re donation-based, so you only tip if you think they did a good job. Which they always do.
The Prague tour started in the Old Town Square where we admired one of the oldest astronomical clocks in the world: Prague Astronomical Clock, Orlaj. This clock not only measure the minutes and hours with its distinctive hand in the shape of the sun, but also tracks the days of the week, month, year, and zodiacal ring showing the path of the sun and moon through the sky (i.e., “Star time”). It’s currently under major renovation, and is expected to complete by the end of October 2018.
During the tour, we also visited the Jewish Quarter and other historical landmarks.
Charles Bridge was completed in 1390, but only took Charles’ name in the 19th century — it was originally known simply as Kamenný most aka Stone Bridge (lol). You can take a walk on this bridge, or if you want a view OF the bridge itself, you can walk along the river or across any of the parallel bridges.
Because it’s at the top of every Prague visitor’s must-see list, if you want to have it all to yourself, you’ll have to visit at night or very early in the morning (i.e., at sunrise). Hint: perhaps before or after your night out clubbing?
Pražský Hrad, Kajetánka, Hradčanské nám., 118 00 Malá Strana, Czechia
Of course, Prague Castle is a must visit while in Prague (as it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and the largest coherent castle complex in the world — more than 750,000 square feet).
However, after you trek up to visit the castle, be sure to swing by this Starbucks before winding your way back down the hill. You’ll be rewarded with a veranda with the most beautiful views over the city of Prague.
Situated within the walls of the Strahov Monastery are two of the most magnificent library halls, dating back to the 17th century: Theological Hall and Philosophical Hall. If my college’s library looked like this, maybe I would have hit up the library more often. Just sayin’.
In addition to the entrance fee, you’ll need to purchase a photo pass to take photos, but hey gotta support the cause, right?
After, we grabbed a few beers from the Strahov Monastic Brewery. I don’t typically drink beer, but even I conceded and gave them a thumbs up. This microbrewery serves up some delicious staples as well as a few seasonal beers. Super charming ambiance and a good time!
After John Lennon’s murder in 1980, he became a pacifist hero for many young Czechs. The wall first started with a painting of Lennon along with political graffiti and Beatles lyrics.
While authorities initially repeatedly tried whitewashing the walls, they have since bowed to the inevitable, and the wall is now a symbol of global ideals of love and peace. Quite romantic.
The late Anthony Bourdain went so far as to describe Czech Republic as “the land that vegetables forgot”. Meat lovers, rejoice!
What better place to grab lunch than at this old butcher shop, where they source meat directly from farms around Czech Republic who raise the animals, including Prestice pigs (an old Czech breed of pigs). Naše Maso, I want mas.
If you’re not looking to buy a raw hunk of meat to cook on your own, you can order and eat there like we did. The menu consists mainly of burgers and sausages, with a beef tartare dish, meat loaf and some cold cuts for good measure. But you can also order anything on display and they’ll cook it right up for you.
Prague’s classic lunchtime favorite is chlebícky aka an “open-faced sandwich”
Bistro Sisters makes a very modernized, elevated version of it. The flavor combinations displayed in the beautiful case are so well thought out. They were almost too pretty to eat, but surprise, they taste good too! So I had every last bite.
Tbh I don’t remember what this place was called, but that pork knuckle was sow delicious. And alarmingly big. Who knows, this was probably a “tourist trap”, but I didn’t care. You know why? Because I felt like a barbarian and loved it.
Cafe Savoy serves famous Czech classics such as pork schnitzel, as well as some beautiful basic brunches (from what I could tell from IG). The restaurant was recently renovated, yet still has its Neo-Renaissance feel.
I went for after-dinner desserts. Among other goodies, we tried the Makový koláček aka poppy seed cake. Was pleasantly surprised to find that the sweets here are not as cloyingly sweet as the ones we have in the States.
In the blazing summer heat, identifying a good gelato shop is critical to survival.
When I had the first lick of my salty caramel and nocciola aka hazelnut cone, I certainly felt like angels were calling my name. It didn’t hurt that they claim to hand-churn this goodness out of local, natural ingredients.
Runner-up favorite for us was Puro Gelato.
BEWARE: there is a tourist trap called trdelníks aka a “chimney cake” and this new trend where they fill them with soft-serve ice cream.
Everyone has lost their minds over it. While it’s super IG-friendly, don’t be fooled into thinking it’s a traditional Czech dessert. It’s a fairly new addition (<20 years) to Czech gastronomy, but given that it’s sweet, pretty, and different enough from your standard donuts and pastries to be interesting, this is a dessert that’s here to stay.
However to add insult to injury, they don’t even taste good. Given that A) I like desserts and B) I am basic and like pretty things, I tried not ONE, but TWO. And on both occasions, I can confirm, this is a tourist trap. Pretty to look at, kind of dry. Disappointing, really.
As you know, I’ve never been a big fan of beer. But when the most talked about place in Prague is a beer garden, you better bet your keg I’ll be there.
This was our only destination north of the river, and wow even the view alone was worth it. After a (mildly tiring) winding hike up a hill, we were rewarded with a gorgeous panorama view of the old town below. And my friend was rewarded with a beer. So cheers to that.
Have you heard of any famous Czech wines or wineries? No? Neither had I.
However this was one of my favorite stops during my time in Prague because the reason why we don’t get to taste (or hear) about Czech wines is because for the most part, their wine isn’t exported out of the country.
Not surprising since they only grow 20,000 hectares of vines. In comparison, France grows more than 800,000 hectares… that’s 4,000% more than Czech Republic. And in Czech, the wine consumption per capita is nearly 23 liters per year. So it’s no wonder they don’t have the wine or time to ship it out here to the states.
So what wine varietal is the Czech Republic known for? Due to the continental climate in Marovia (the largest wine region in the country), the majority of grape varietals that do well are white grapes (and their principal varietal is Welschriesling) although that’s not to say you shouldn’t have them recommend a few to you.
You might learn a thing or two, or at the very least drink a glass or two, like I did.
Do as the locals do and just chill.
In addition to the grassy knoll where people watch the sun sett over Prague Castle, there’s actually also a beer garden nearby. But we opted to grab a bottle from a local store and hike up to the top of the hill to enjoy the sunset (fantastic view).
Peaceful, tranquil, allegro.
Due to the aggressive flooding Prague is prone to, much of the city was actually raised by a few meters in the 10th century.
And this turned many of the originally ground-level rooms into makeshift interconnected cellars. The cavern-like rooms are actually quite cozy and such fun exploring (because each wine cellar / room within has its own personality)
The two we visited were U Sudu and Vzorkovna. U Sudu felt pretty hip, and a good time overall. Vzorkovna was even more hip, issuing wristbands at the door that we had to preload minimum Czech Koruna to use once inside. Interesting concept, and a fun night overall (and there’s a resident dog I might add…) Great way to to socialize with locals and tourists alike.
This club is nuts. It’s 5 floors, making it the biggest night club in central Europe. And every floor has a different DJ spinning different tunes: mainstream, EDM, oldies, hip hop, and mellow tunes.
You know those nights where you and your friends go out, but you keep trying to go to different places because one of your girl friends will inadvertently want a different scene? Well that’s not a problem here. And that’s also probably why it’s crowded with both locals and tourists alike.
It’s situated right on the water, just East of the Charles Bridge. So the view at night is beautiful, as is the sunrise after you’ve dance the night away (yes, I can confirm that they’re open until 5 AM)
Thanks for reading! Enjoy what you’ve read so far? Feel free to Czech out more of my adventures in Europe below:

It was the first week of December and temperature outside was -3 Celsius. The wish to see the German-European Christmas markets came with its weather implications, even more so in Prague. Balancing my walk on the icy, slippery cobbled streets and braving the extreme cold, I finally made my way via the Golden Lane to the viewpoint at the Prague Castle. There, warming my freezing palms and soul with a glass of mulled wine, I gazed upon the city.
With the snow and lights, Prague looked like a Southern Indian bride, draped in white and gold. Is there another city more beautiful than Prague? Not in my experience. Prague is a town plucked straight out of your fairytales. There are castles, cathedrals, stone bridges, opera houses, and a giant peculiar medieval clock, keeping track of time for 600 years. And if you decide to step outside the town to Bohemian Switzerland, you will find yourself in the magical world of the movie Narnia, where mountains are cloaked in silver trees and you hike amongst the petrified ogres.
Over the years, every person discovering my passion for history would advise me to visit Prague. “So old and beautiful…so much history”. It surprised me a bit as Prague (or Czech in general) does not make its appearance in the accounts of antiquity which is my primary area of interest. So I brought a book on the history of Prague to enlighten myself. Between the text and my walking tours, here is what I learnt.
The tale of Prague (or Praha) begins with a beautiful myth of Libuše and her Amazon like female forces laying its foundation. However, its emergence onto the stage of Western history occurs as late as 1333 with the reign of Charles IV. Born as heir of Luxembourg and raised by his uncle Charles in France, Charles IV is hailed as the icon that placed Prague on the map. He brought the seat of Holy Roman Empire to Prague for the first time after which the boundaries of Bohemia, Bavaria and Austria kept shifting, colliding the cultural tectonic plates of Jewish, French, Italian, German and Bohemian cultures.
Two hundred years before Martin Luther initiated Reformation of Christianity against the Catholic Church, a Czech priest named Jan Hus was burnt at stake by the Church for questioning practices like Simony and Eucharist. In 1600, Johannes Kepler questioned the perfection of the universe itself when he suggested the orbital trajectory of planets is elliptical and not a perfect circle. Mozart’s Don Giovanni considered too distasteful by the Holy royals of Vienna, was premiered in Estate Theater in Prague in 1787.
Maria Theresa introduced the compulsory schooling of children in Habsburg empire bringing universal literacy to Prague and giving birth to writers like Franz Kafka immortalizing the city in their works. After the First World War, Prague emerged as a strong democracy under the philosopher President Tomáš Masaryk, a protestant who re-established Jan Hus as the symbol of Czech Nationalism. And after the Second World War, Prague fell under the Communist rule only to regain freedom and its culture in 1989.
So quite a lot happened in Prague but to be fair, its not very different from the story of any medieval European city — A founding myth, a glorious Christian monarch, a monument inscribed in his glory, some Renaissance science followed by artwork in the age of Enlightenment, melancholy in the age of existentialism and atrocities in the age communism. If you are lucky, may be a Roman connection with its ruins of camps and baths.  Then what is so special about Prague that captures the aesthetic eye? The answer to this question came from a local tour guide while describing the only ugly thing in this gorgeous town — the Žižkov TV tower built by Communist. He said “I know its ugly and we hated communist but its there because its still our history. In Prague, we preserve everything.”

Whether it’s the new world of America or the ancient land of India, people in all ages have decided to live in their selected view of history and constructed that obstructed view by destroying the representation of any other era. While in India, it’s the classic imposition of superiority of one group over another, America is unique in the sense that they just destroy the old for their love of new. The first Ferris wheel, the original Opera houses in New York are all long gone. But a lot around the world has also been lost because new rulers refuse to accept the old as their legacy. Talibans destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan , Left wing Portland pulled down Abraham Lincoln’s statue and BJP in India abandoned the Edwin Lutyens Parliament building as the symbol of British Imperialism.
But nothing is lost in Prague. Somehow the rulers in all ages agreed to maintain the continuity and today, its entire story can be relived with physical representations of each era through out the city. You don’t have to imagine prosperity of the Carolines, the reforms of Habsburg, the curiosity of the Renaissance scholars or the lack of creativity of communism. You just need to open your eyes and see how the contradictions coexists in these 200 square miles.
World’s third largest atheist population walks across the Charles Bridge everyday surrounded by the statues of Catholic saints. Ladislav Šaloun decided to honor Jan Hus with a monument in Old Town without destroying the Catholic Church of our Lady before Tyn across the street. Kafka’s grim portrayal of Prague was celebrated even in the nationalist years of 1920s. And for the country known for its exports of engineering equipments, there is no desire to put a show of prosperity by replacing the stone bridge with steel structure or astronomical clock with a 3D Billboard.
These structures provide a complete picture of the history of Prague, against the backdrop of which, we can comprehend the city’s inhabitants and their present identities.
What makes Prague truly exceptional is this embracing of their legacy and the commitment to preserve it. The beauty of the city lies in its 1000 year old journey chronicled by its own nooks and corners.

is an ancient city filled with a long history of mystery, with much more than meets the eye. I recently had the pleasure of visiting this amazing city in August 2023. It was a last minute trip, so I truly had zero expectations for what to expect. Soon after landing, I realized I had stumbled upon an alchemical city filled with intrigue and magic! You can feel a buzzing energy once you step into this uniquely built city. The buildings and streets all seem to be laid in some perfect, symmetrical grid. Prague Castle sits high up on the hill, giving off an almost invincible feeling as you look upon it. This was the home of the Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who was obsessed with Alchemy, and the pursuit of the Philospher’s Stone. King Charles built The Charles Bridge in 1357, built strategically with astronomers and numerologists, to align the bridge and towers with the rising and setting of the sun. Prague was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire in 1300’s, and is where King Charles oversaw The Golden Age of Bohemia.
There is an abundance of mysticism and symbolism throughout the city, which is filled with alchemical bars, fascinating museums, and the famous astrological clock that brings the city center to life. Visiting Prague is certainly a portal to the old world, which lead the way for modern pharmacy and medicines. Praha truly seems to be covered in magic, and I highly recommend you visit this mystic, legendary city. Here are my 3 reasons why Prague should be high up on your travel itinerary.
I am not the biggest fan of cities, but Prague was a city full of wonder and mystery. The roads told a story of a distant past, the aged buildings still etched with beautiful gargoyles, symbols and designs, still dimly shining their radiance. I was immediately in awe at how well preserved the historic buildings and statues were. It truly felt like I was in a medieval movie, moving forward on my own alchemical journey. The city seemed old, yet proud, with all of its traditions and secrets. I am fascinated by stories of alchemy and have enjoyed researching this field for years; and now I stumbled upon a whole alchemical city. Just my luck!
One of the most notable proponents of alchemy was the Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who ruled and lived in Prague until his death in 1612. He was a very curious leader, who encouraged alchemists, astronomers, philosophers to travel to Prague and share their teachings. This was technically their modern day medicine, so Rudolph naturally built his own laboratory at the castle. He was obsessed with find the Philosopher’s stone, which according to legend is the key to the Elixir for immortal life. He brought over Edward Kelley, a self proclaimed spirit medium, and John Dee, occultist and Mathematician. You can visit a recreation of the alchemical laboratory Rudolph had in the Prague Castle.
This museum houses real alchemical laboratories, only recently discovered in 2002 due to intense flooding and road erosion. Within the museum they found herbs, flasks, and more in an underground complex of labs and rooms. The underground labs still contain original glassworks, rooms, and kilns the alchemist’s used for transmuting lead to gold. It is an incredible experience to set foot where true alchemists have stepped foot, creating and experimenting with elixirs that have changed the face of medicine today. The underground is truly remarkable, and filled with different tunnels and passageways. They offer a guided tour of 30 minutes, which is actually packed with interesting information and sights, which I highly recommend!
This marvel within Prague is one of the main landmarks you will see in Prague. This bridge, which used to be a main crossing between East and West Europe, was built in 1357 by King Charles in accordance with the palindromic number 13579753. King Charles worked with astronomers and numerologists on how, where, and when to build this historic bridge. By working with the stars and numerology, Charles constructed the bridge to align with planetary energy, and to align with the rising and setting of the sun. Pretty advanced stuff for 700 years ago! Along the bridge there are several sculptures of historical figures that represent Prague’s long history. You can take a boat tour that take you around the bridge and gives you heaps of interesting information about the bridge, its past, and the Prague Castle.
There are rumors that Prague was laid out in a geometrical shape, adhering to symmetry and planetary grids. I truly feel like this is not far from the truth. I’ve traveled to some amazing energy vortexes in my life, and it was quite surprising to find the energy still strong, even within this bigger city. There are also many underground tunnels, and small street that seem to go on forever. Get lost in these mystic streets, and who knows, maybe you’ll find what you’re looking for!
This is a no-brainer! Prague Castle is the biggest castle complex in the world, and you can certainly tell when you visit. It stand watch high over Prague, a beautiful sight to see from almost anywhere in the city. The complex and intricate design of the roofs and towers of the castle are truly an ode to the complexities of life and nature. It is remarkable to see such a great feat done and still standing from so long ago. The original Prague Castle was built in the 9th century, yet you can still get a good idea of what the original felt like! It seems time skipped over this part of the world, still revealing clues to our distant past. The castle is filled with sculptures, angels, demons, and scars of its’ past. Walk around the Castle and marvel in its wonder. It is a nice walk up a hill, so do be prepared! It’s all worth it once you get to the top, as the view from the city is truly amazing. It also holds the Guinness Book of World Record for largest Castle Complex!
I found one of my favorite bars in the world. I really enjoy Alchemy, and its rare to find a place that is Alchemically themed, and done well. I won’t give away the location, as you will need to find it yourself ( come on, alchemist!), but this is a must do here in Prague. Their bar will brew some mystic elixirs that may enhance Alchemical power and insight. The whole bar has really cool decorations (its very own Hermit), and the menu is filled with illustrations and sayings that will have you rethinking your life.
Prague is a short train ride away from Plzin, the official home of the Pilsner Beer. It actually got ripped off from a famous American brand, which isn’t totally surprising! Prague is actually the leader in the world for most beers consumed per capita. Prague is lined with traditional pubs and restaurants, ready for you to try some of their unique dishes. It is a charming place with lots of history, and people seem to gravitate to small pubs and places to eat, and just talk and observe the beauty. Get yourself a cold one and kick your feet up, buddy!
Czech goulash is a pretty unique, tasty traditional meal that should try. A Proper homemade Czech Goulash is prepared by first braising chunks of stewing beef with potatoes, tomato, onions, paprika and garlic. This serving is usually served with crusty bread, boiled dumplings or noodles. Wash it down with an ice cold glass of pilsner lager like an original Pilsner Urquell.
I am a big fan of shows like Vikings because I get to fantasize about how it was to live in earlier times. Times before electricity, before the internet and before mobile phones. I was able to really feel like I had stepped in the past in Prague. Being from the States, its rare to see such ancient feeling buildings, roads and infrastructure. You can go to so many museums, shops, cathedrals, and shop within just Prague alone. The city seems to be proud of its rich heritage, and they have preserved much of its history. There are many important historical events and figures that have traversed to the City of Alchemy, and have surely been amazed by its’ charm. Enjoy the never ending wonders within the streets of this magical city.
There is a big bohemian energy in Czech, which makes sense, since it is originally the home of the Kingdom of Bohemia. There are many crystal shops, yoga places, and mystic shops sprinkled throughout. I was lucky enough to know a few friends out there, and was able to see another side of Czechia outside of the city. The forest truly seem to contain fairies within them; there is that mystic charm that I have heard so much about of the enchanting European forests. The soil is fertile and lush, the people content and beautiful in their own ways. There is a quiet and calm energy all throughout the countryside. If you are like me, you enjoy some solitude and retreat into nature and chance you may get. This was a welcome treat after traveling through other busy cities in Europe.
I was able to see some less travelled places in Czech, and the charm only grew from there. The people were very welcoming, and the natural beauty really held me in its arms. It feels a lot more simple in the countryside, where they are unburdened by the heaviness of the city. If you can, take a train outside of the city, take a walk through nature, and eat a mom and pop restaurant. Thank me later.
Get to Prague if you are traveling nearby in Europe! If the mystic, magical, and mysterious intrigues you, I guarantee you will have a great time if you travel to Prague. There is a treasure trove of secrets and history amongst the castles, museums and ancient river. The old cobblestone roads, mixed with goulash and Pilsners, will captivate your senses as you gaze upon historic marvels. Satisfy your craving for more alchemical tools along your hero’s journey! This geometrically aligned city has more secrets waiting to be revealed. I would take at least 3–5 days to explore most of Prague and the surrounding towns. Take the leap into the unknown and travel into this City of Alchemy.

Currently, in the middle of the corona pandemic crisis, it might not be the right time to travel unfortunately. Last year I was on a little eurotrip and one of the places I visited was Prague in the Czech Republic. If you’re sitting at home watching Triple X and dreaming about where to go next after all this is over then here are some budget tips on what to do in one of the most beautiful cities in central Europe.
Walk around in the old town
With documented settlements dating back over a thousand years and current buldings such as the Old Town Hall with the foundation being built in the 14th century, Prague’s old town called Staré Město in the Czech language will leave you with a magical feeling.
This is a must and quite frankly difficult to avoid since the medieval Staré Město is smack in the middle of the city center. Go see the astronomical clock which was installed in 1410, the old town square, the stands in the narrow streets and the Charles bridge. If you look around closely you might find some cosy hidden restaurants such as the Charles Bridge Restaurant which is basically a floating barge, sitting on the water by the base of the bridge on the Old town side. Pro tip: You might also wanna try the local Czech cuisine at some smaller place around the corner on a side street away from the tourist rush. That’s generally how I’ve stumbled on some of the best food on my trips. The Czech cuisine resembles other central and east European dishes such as goulash, various soups and pancakes, bread dumplings, schnitzel and baked meat. For a drink you should try any Czech beer. It really doesn’t matter which one you choose, they all taste magnificient and much better than at home.
Prague is literally a city of bridges, it has over 300 hundred of them, so there are many more to see than just the Charles bridge. Each with their own history to tell. Some other famous ones are the Legion bridge, the Mánes Bridge and the Palacký Bridge.
Visit the St. Vitus Cathedral and the Castle complex
This huge breathtaking gothic style cathedral is the largest church in the Czech republic. The main tower is over 100 metres high (328+ feet) and the cathedral itself is situated on top of a large hill which is housing the Prague Castle complex. From the hill you are able to see most of Prague’s center and the nature around it. One of the slopes even has a vineyard.
The castle is very big and was originally built in the 9th century and went on being improved up until the mid 19th century. Because of all the different eras in which it was constructed it consists of different architectural styles. Inside the complex are several museums in which you can learn all about the history of the Czech republic and also the famous so called Golden Lane. There are also several art galleries, small cafe’s and shops, although it might be bit of a tourist trap. Be wary of the prices and unnecessary touristic small stuff.
Go up the Petřín Hill
A large hill is situated just off the center on the other side of the Vltava river above the Malá Strana district. The top is higher than the castle hill and rises 130 metres above the river. From there you can get some amazing views over Prague. The Petřín Hill is a popular rectreational area and almost the entire hill is covered in parks. The so called Hunger Wall was built in the 14th century on the hill and is still there to be visited.
There is also a tall Eiffel styled lookout tower which you can visit for a fee. Although for sure a nice view I would however say that it’s not worth its price, and if you walk past by over to the Strahov Stadium (one of the largest stadiums ever built) there is a nice view point there by the tunnel ventilation tower. Although still in use, the stadium is a remnant of the old communist era. The tunnel towers has an interesting modernism style and were built and designed in the 80’s and 90’s by an architect called Jiří Trnka.
To get to the top of the hill you can either walk, take the bus or tram or the funicular rail. If you’re walking from the city center there is a restaurant on the way up called Petřínské terasy. It’s situated straight up to the west of the Kampa riverside. Grab a bite with Czech styled food and enjoy the view over the city and the castle if you’re hungry or just step by for a drink.
While not a super fancy place, they do offer weddings and it has a large outdoor terrace. Inside you can enjoy the lumberjack styled pub and restaurant. They also have a large open fireplace that you can watch while you’re sitting and relaxing reading Frommer’s.
Check out the Vítkov hill Monument
There’s another hill in the Žižkov district on the opposite side of the city center which is called Vítkov. On top of it is a memorial monument that features a large granite stone plaza and a large grey bulding. A huge bronze statue is standing on a pedestal in front of the building resembling Jan Žižka, who in 1420 in the Battle of Vítkov Hill defeated enemy forces.
The memorial monument was mainly built in the 1930’s but had to be paused when the WWII started and the Germans occupied the land. It was later finished and was for a while used to promote communism. In 2000–2009 a renovation work was made by the National Museum and was reopened for the public to enjoy. From this place you will have one of the best views over Prague. It’s especially extraordinary in the sunset and many people are coming there to watch it.
Bonus tip: Around the Seifertova street nearby are several cocktail bars for having a little preparty or a drink on the way into the Old Town districts. You should maybe not stay too late as it might get noisy in this area and filled with drunk people.
Also nearby, on the other side of the railroad is a beautiful church called the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius, and just past it is a small asian place called Ngô where they serve fantastic food. This is a convenient area to stay in and with walking distance from the Old Town so look for hotels here. I stayed at Hotel Alwyn which is a pretty good hotel.
Have a drink at a roof bar
Roof bars are getting more and more popular and Prague has them as well. There is for example a nice one on top of the Hotel U Prince, nearby the Old Town Hall, with 360° views over the city. There is a restaurant so you can enjoy a bite and they make their own signature cocktails. It’s possible to stumble upon higher priced places but this one is still fairly reasonably priced. Just enter the hotel at street level and look for a glassed elevator, it will take you up to the roof restaurant and terrace. Other roof bars worth a visit are Cloud 9 in the large Hilton hotel, CODA restaurant in the Malá Strana district, Duplex in the center and T-anker in the old town.
Generally you will find value for your money in Prague and in the Czech republic. They have their own currency, Czech crowns, but might accept euros in some places. In smaller restaurants they might be slightly reluctant to taking cards for some reason so be sure to bring some cash as well. Situated in central Europe you can get there by car from Germany and Poland, or Austria from the south. There is an international airport for which most European airlines operate to and from the US you can go with Delta or American Airlines.

In full transparency, our Eastern European stint of Budapest — Vienna — Prague is starting to blur together. While each of these cities are of course different, there are a lot of commonalities in terms of architecture, cuisine, and atmosphere. We were in Budapest and Prague for just over a week each, with only three days in Vienna, but all three stops were also slightly limited by poor weather, travel fatigue, and/or illness making it fairly even across the board. We traveled between them by train which was efficient, comfortable, and a change from planes and cars. Overall, I think Prague was my favourite of these three, but by very slim margins. It had a great mix of everything you could want: it was lively, the architecture is unmatched, many buildings are actually original whereas several in the other cities were destroyed during wars and rebuilt in the same style. Many of the buildings here were also painted pastel colours making the neighborhoods feel unique and cheery.
Activity-wise, Prague (similarly to Budapest and Vienna), was filled with a lot of walking and exploring the area. We did two walking tours, and visited a museum, and aside from that our activities were wandering, eating, and people-watching — our favourites! We stayed in a hotel in Prague as well, which was a nice change from our Air BnBs. While very basic, we did have breakfast included. I did miss having a kitchen, but overall it was nice to be in comfy beds with daily room services.
Our first walking tour was an introduction to the city, winding through the Jewish quarter, crossing the Charles Bridge, and finishing at the Lennon Wall. While walking past one of the oldest synagogues in the city we learned the legend of Golem, a clay man brought to life by Rabbi Loew to help protect the Jewish people. The Rabbi would deactivate the Golem on Shabbat, however one week he forgot and the Golem got loose, leaving a path of destruction in his path. After this, the Rabbi never brought Golem to life again, and the form is said to still be locked in the attic of the old-new Synagogue. While this is the most famous Golem legend, he is not the first man of clay as this idea is reflected in stories and Jewish folklore prior to the 16th century. I find legends and folklore very interesting, and both Budapest and Prague offered nighttime ghost and legends tours that we had planned to take but were rained out which was disappointing.
Our tour also took us past the astronomical clock, a famous symbol of Prague. It is an intricate clock with multiple displays dictating the time, positions of the sun and moon, and Zodiac constellations. Given it’s age (built in the 15th century), it’s incredible how accurate it is. On the hour each hour is the worlds first puppet show, as a few of the figurines around the clock nod or make similar small movements, leading the square to be packed with people.
Charles Bridge was once the only bridge across the Vltava River, with construction starting in 1357 and ending in the early 15th century. As we crossed we heard buskers playing tunes and passed small stands selling jewelry and paintings.
After crossing the bridge we made our way to the Lennon Wall, named after Jon Lennon from the Beatles. John is not from the Czech Republic, nor did he live there, however when he was shot in New York in 1980, young Prague residents decided to draw on a wall in Prague as a memorial to the musician. Artistic and personal expression was not allowed under the communist regime in power at the time, and so by the next day the officials had painted over the drawings. The artists came back and painted again, only to have it painted over the next day. And so they painted on it again, and this cycle continued. It quickly evolved into a silent protest against communism. The wall still stands, and people continue to add their own artwork and words to it as it has become a symbol of freedom of speech and self-expression.
Our second walking tour was of Prague Castle, timed to see the changing of the guard. the rain held off for 90% of the three hours, and there were gorgeous views from the castle of the city below.
We also visited the Narodni Museum, which is a natural history museum founded in 1818. The exhibitions themselves are what you would expect from this sort of museum, nothing spectacular or unique, but for me the star of the show is the building itself. The detailed tiles and architecture were truly stunning.
We were overdue for a night out and decided to go on a pub crawl as Prague is known to have awesome nightlife that goes all night long. Overall, this was a fun night, but I would say it was not the best pub crawl we’ve gone on. It was a very large group, many coming together from a hostel where a lot of pre-drinking had clearly happened and also meant that it was quite a young crowd. The first couple of places we went to were fairly empty, but our group was large and the pubs were small so we filled them up and it was a fun time. This pub crawl justifies its price by providing a free drink at each stop (typical of European pub crawls), as well as free entry into the largest club in Prague. We went on a Thursday, which we thought would be fine given Prague’s reputation and that we’re entering peak tourism season. We were wrong. The final club was not only a twenty-minute walk from the last bar, but it also was completely empty. The club is five floors with different music on each, and it would take a lot of people to fill it up… but it was really disappointing, with maybe five people in each of the large spaces. We left almost as soon as we got there, waited for twenty minutes in the cold night for the tram which didn’t come (turns out we were on the wrong street), and wandered through the area until we picked up a free wifi network to call an Uber and make our way home. A bit of an unfortunate end, but a fun evening for the first 3–4 hours!
After about five days of amazing exploration and soaking in everything the city had to offer, I got my third cold of the trip. David and I both went to bed with throats that felt scratchy. In typical fashion, David’s immune system won and he woke up feeling ok, mine did not, and I woke up with a full-blown head cold and raw throat that stuck with me for several days, and now a week later is still clinging on with a hoarse cough in the evenings that I just can’t seem to kick. Our last couple of days were also pouring rain, so they were quiet days, we went out here and there, but mostly enjoyed the hotel and again took some recharge time before heading to our final destination of the entire trip: southern Portugal.

In my Previous work at GoodData, I had a chance to have two business trips to Prague, Czech Republic. Before joining GoodData, I have never been to any European counties east of Germany or Austria. In 2022, our team had trouble finding sales engineers in the Czech Republic, so everyone in our team was taking turns working in Prague to cover the European business timezone. Therefore, I went to Prague to help out the sales representatives in Prague as a temporary sales engineer in May 2022 and September 2022.
First time to “This Part of Europe”This is my first time visiting the Czech Republic, and also the first time visiting a former Warsaw Pact country. I was very curious about how the country transformed after the Berlin Wall broke 30 years later, and how much does the Czech Republic different from the European countries I have been to. Most of my colleagues asked me whether this is the first time I visit Europe, I told them: “This is the first time I have been to ‘This Part of Europe’”.
My first impression of the Czech Republic is Soviet architecture in the suburban, Pre-Modern Austro-Hungarian city-style Downtown, Modern Western European office buildings in the business area. When I arrived in Prague airport, the airport is obviously built during the former Warsaw Pact era the building is very rectangular and lack of decoration, which creates a contradiction when modern Boeing or Airbus aircraft were parked against it. Although the highways looked new and well-maintained, I can still see some poor-maintained Soviet-style buildings in the suburban area. Once the taxi enters Prague’s city limit, the city's appearance changed to the beautiful 19th-century Austro-Hungarian city-style Downtown, mixed with newly built Western European office buildings. I am able to see the overview memories of the Czechs in the form of Prague architecture.
No One Calls it CzechiaDuring my stay in Prague, I have more opportunities to talk with the locals since I was working with them for a couple of weeks. I literally hear none of the Czech call their country Czechia. They mostly call their country by their full name — the Czech Republic, or the country abbreviation — CZ (American Zee) or CZ (British Zat). It appears that Czechs in general really don’t like the new name for their country (I personally call it the Czech Republic too).
Another interesting thing I learnt in Prague is that the relationship between Czechs and Slovakians is not as close as I thought. I learnt from an American YouTuber that Czechs and Slovakians are culturally close so their relationship is as intimate as siblings, but one of my Prague colleagues disagreed.
The City AppearanceDowntown Prague is a very beautiful city where the beauty came from the late Middle Ages and pre-Modern style buildings next to tram routes. The iconic Soviet-style Prague trams ran between those buildings are the only confusion that you think you are visiting a Warsaw Pact country in the latter half of the 20th century, but you realize there are newly built Austrian trams replacing the aging iconic trams when they pass by occasionally.
Sadly, most of my time in Prague was spent at the GoodData headquarter and I did not have a lot of chance to go around the city, besides Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and Petrin Tower.
Office Culture is a Mixture of American and Continent EuropeAlthough GoodData originated from the Czech Republic, the company culture was relatively Americanized. Besides the office appearance looks very no different from a Tech company in the San Francisco Bay Area, the work culture is basically the same! The atmosphere in the GoodData headquarter embraces creativity, work-life balance, and the work-hard-play-hard mentality. During my stay in Prague, I feel the work environment in the Prague office is the same as in the San Francisco office.
Czechs are very easy to work with: They are not as serious as German, nor lazy. They will deliver what you need on time, as long as they have a proper summer break (3–4 weeks off), which does not exist in the Anglophone countries. Their impression of American work culture is a hard work culture with an insufficient amount of holidays — One of my colleagues mentioned he was impressed (negatively) that American mothers can only take 10 weeks of paid maternity time off that he does not wish to live in the US if his wife and he are planning to have kids.
Czech FoodBesides Pilnser, anyone who visits the Czech Republic should try any duck dish since Czech ducks taste very taste! One of the common duck dishes in the Czech Republic is duck confit (Which is also common in Slovakia, Austria, and maybe Poland?), although my Czech colleagues always laugh at me eating what they eat on Sunday prepared by their grandmas. This grandma's dish usually serves with Czech dumplings and pickles to ease the duck grease.
On my second trip to Prague, half of my team was actually visiting Prague. Therefore, my manager decided to bring us to a team lunch. Although my manager is a Czech who lived in San Francisco, he acts very differently when he is in Prague. When he was bringing us to lunch in San Francisco, he brought us to cafes with health choices; in contrast, he would have brought us to a cafe close to our Prague office too, but the first thing to order is wine. I bet Europeans are very flexible in switching their culture mode wherever they are at.
Prague has quite a big portion of the Vietnamese population (They have mostly immigrated to the Czech Republic in the 70’s and 80’s), so there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants or shops serve pho and Vietnamese sandwiches. Not surprisingly, there are a lot of Chinese restaurants; however, most of those Chinese restaurants not only serve Chinese dishes, but also Japanese, Korean, and Thai dishes as well…
Czechs in General Hates the Communist EraWorking in a company with Czech heritage allows me to understand the Czechs. I thought the Czechs have some degree of good memories from the Communist Era, but I was wrong! The upper managers in GoodData sent memos to us during the pandemic to make up the communication supposed to be done on-site, I remember one of the memos was sent during the week of the celebration of the Velvet Revolution for embracing freedom gained after the end of communist-ruled Czechoslovakia.
During the last week of my first Prague visit, I was planning to watch an opera in the State Opera House. While I was discussing with my colleagues how to get to the opera house from the office, one of my colleagues started to complain about the city planning policy during the Communist Era (Out of nowhere too…but he has a point). He was complaining about the fact that a highway was built next to the opera house, which made complicated and inconvenient pedestrian access and prevented the highway to build straight to avoid the road cutting through the building (If a highway is not straight enough, then it is not fast). Although I tried not to give any opinion on this topic as an outsider, I can see the reputation of the previous era has left a bruise on the Czechs.
Prague Castle and Charles BridgeMy colleagues were nice to bring me to visit Prague Castle and Charles Bridge after Wednesday work and had dinner together next to Prague Castle.
My impression of Prague Castle is not a castle! To me, a castle is a walled building built in the Middle Age or before for the landlord to live; Prague Castle looks like a pre-Modern era palace, which is a couple of hundred years ahead of its time.
We had dinner and beer afterward. And of course, my colleagues ordered something that I never had. One of those is Chicken liver paté.
After dinner, we walk from Prague Castle and across Charles Bridge to take the metro. During the walk, my colleagues explained Prague Castle and Charles Bridge. I really enjoyed visiting the sightseeing spots with the locals rather than guides because the locals know what the sightseeing spots are, but they can’t remember hard fact details like the year when built and historical figures, it makes them more authentic rather than a guide who tries to impress you.
Petrin TowerIf I have to pick one must-see sightseeing spot it has to be Petrin Tower, over Prague Castle or Charles Bridge. I personally am attracted by the architecture of Prague, therefore, Petrin Tower is the best place to view Prague from a bird's view.
BeerI save this topic to the last — Beer! Basically: Czech Republic = Beer. So that you can understand how important beer is to the Czechs. Among all the national brands, Pilsner is the best for me. Pilsner is a lager that has a very light body with some pine finish, it is a very refreshing beverage, especially for summer! One good reason to visit Prague: Pilsner is significantly taster when serve in draft beer than in cans!
During my second visit to Prague, my company had an offsite in a local theater in Prague. Interestingly, beer was served between breaks for the whole afternoon, but no one was drunk by the end of all presentations at 6 pm. Czechs simply cannot get drunk on beer (Not sure whether that is a good thing or not). I am not a person who is crazy for nightlife so I don’t consider myself a good dancer, one of my male colleagues was impressed with my dance move. He asked me how he can dance as well as me, I told him the key is to get drunk since I don’t have a good answer for him so I joked with him. He was quite a humour to say: “That’s the problem! We Czechs are hard to get drunk.” Quite an answer!
ConclusionI really love Prague, and so does the Czech Republic. I really like the architecture of Prague, the city vibe, the city, and the people! They gave me a good time when I was visiting Prague. It is a very nice place to visit as you would learn a lot from the people and the city. It is also very affordable to visit. A 3-star hotel night (May or October) is less than 100 Euros in the city center, and a decent dine-in meal cost you about 20 Euros with beer and coffee. It is worth your money, not only on seeing Charles Bridge and Prague Castle but also I am pretty sure both Prague and the Czech Republic can give you a Central European vibe that you can enjoy. I am not sure when next time, but next time I got to visit as a tourist! And I really miss Pilsner too!

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic with a long history as the central city of the region and the first capitol city of Bohemia. Bohemia dates back to 870 where by 1198 the Kingdom of Bohemia was established as part of the Holy Roman Empire. Prague has served as the center of life for the region through trade technology language and culture where much of the art and architecture over the centuries has been thoughtfully preserved. Prague suffered no major damage during the great wars except that many synagogues were robbed and their Jewish community targeted for deportation and execution by the Nazis during World War II.
On a recent visit to Prague my wife and I toured Old Town, the Jewish Quarter, Malá Strana, Prague Castle, and Wenceslas Square in New Town primarily on foot and with some assistance from the public tram system. One of the interesting and amazing discoveries on this visit were the Doors of Prague which I am sharing in this article.
Our room for the week was at the Grand Hotel Praha where we had this wonderful view of the Old Town Hall and the Astronomical Clock. The Old Town Hall building is primarily Gothic in design with some elements of Romanesque and other styles.
In addition to the main entrance there were these doors with a pointed arch of Gothic design a round arch of Romanesque design and a rectangular door with elaborate metalwork similar to that of the Romanesque door.
The interior featured many historical meeting rooms reflecting early forms of developing democracies, including the meeting hall for the people, a governing suite, and Senate chambers.
A unique feature of the Old City Hall and the Old Town area are the underground tunnels that connect the basements of many buildings in the area. The city was raised about 2 to 4 meters beginning in the 13th century to protect the city from flooding and to accommodate the construction of dams and locks on the Vitava River. So the original first floor of many buildings are now underground forming a network of connected basements.
Our first full day in Prague was spent exploring the Old Town Square and some of the surrounding streets to the North and East of the square. Old Town Square has a wide variety of beautiful entrance doors. These feature Romanesque designs with transom lights above the doors providing daylighting to the interior even when the doors are closed. Note the center door below featuring a door within a door.
These entrance doors with Baroque design influences feature bars and gates over the windows and doors with intricate design.
Saint Nicholas Church at Old Town Square features a Baroque architectural style with elaborate doors and this elegant window in the center below with intricate metalwork over the glass.
Art Nouveau influences were found too in these Romanesque entrance near Old Town Square with transom lights that have more free-form patterns integrated into the door designs.
Another elaborate gated entrance on Parízská street, and the blend of Gothic and Romanesque features in the Church of Our Lady at Tyn on Tynská street. These were found on our venture up to the Jewish Quarter and back where we toured the Spanish Synagogue completed in 1868 and its Museum on Jewish history and the holocaust.
Dozens of Jewish Synagogues were destroyed in Czechia and tens of thousands of its citizens were deported and murdered by the Nazis during World War II. Fortunately most of the Synagogues in Prague including the Spanish Synagogue we visited were not destroyed. An example of the architectural loss in other parts of the Czech Republic is this beautiful Baroque Synagogue at Holesov with Moorish design elements.
Holesov was designed by the architect Jakob Gartner and completed in 1893 with elaborate Baroque decorative features on the facade and in its doors and windows. It was burned down and demolished by the Nazis in 1941. An excellent display of the facts can be found at the Spanish Synagogue and Museum just minutes north of Old Town Square.
On our second day we ventured across the Vitava River to Petrin Tower, down to Malá Strana, and back across the Charles Bridge. We took a tram from Old Town to the base of Petrin Hill Park and then another tram up the hill to Petrin Tower. I highly recommend this route as the hill would have been quite a climb and the trams are free for seniors.
Along the way back we found this collection of entrance doors including Baroque style double doors with Moorish influences at the Strahov Monastery and Romanesque style facades at Mostecká street and near the Charles Bridge.
Crossing the Charles Bridge was special because you could see the many statues on the bridge and the spires all around in Old Town, Malá Strana, and the Prague Castle. Here is an interpretation of that experience from my wife Ana Mari.
As we wandered back to Old Town on Mariánské Námestí you can find these new glass doors with transom and side lights, the Art Nouveau facade of the New City Hall which is not that new since it was built in 1911, and around the corner on Linhartská street this gated entrance to the courtyard of a residential complex that can open wide for vehicular traffic or for pedestrians through the door within a door. It actually looked 21st century new.
In the rooms above many of these beautiful buildings are residential quarters. I noticed this early in the mornings when the locals were coming out and leaving for work, some slipping through their door within doors.
Venturing on, these entrances have Romanesque influences found on the doors at Lingartská and Karlova streets. Note again the door within a door in the center image below.
Continuing on Karlova street are more entrances with Baroque and Moorish influences. Note the doors on the right with the large stone bumpers at the base. These were common on many entrances and designed to protect the doors from carts moving in and out from the interior courtyards to the street. Many are still in place and some have been cut or chiseled back as the building use has changed over the years.
Our third day was spent at Prague Castle where we took another tram from Old Town to the top of the hill entering the castle complex from the North. You can walk west from Old Town to the east Castle entrance but it turns into quite a climb by the time you get to Saint Vitus Cathedral.
Saint Vitus Cathedral has Gothic style features as noted by the pointed arches on all of these doors. The front entrance doors have elaborate facades, an interior side door features a door within a door, and one of the back service doors features beautiful stone and metal work.
To the east of the cathedral is St. George’s Basilica which displays many Romanesque features with its doors sunk deep into the thick stone walls.
Our fourth day included an outing south to Wenceslas Square which led to these finds along the way. A Romanesque style door within a door, a Baroque style entrance with some Moorish influences, and an Art Nouveau styled entrance.
Approaching Wenceslas Square there is a transition from Old Town to New Town where here Romanesque influences can be seen in the entrances on Rytírská street and Wenceslas Square.
Our last day was a free day for wandering which included a round about route to the southeast to see the Franz Kafka Head by sculptor David Cerny. Along the way we made these discoveries on Jalovcová and Husova streets. Note the elaborate designs and textures and another door within a door.
At this entrance on Husova street below, note the door within a door to what looks like private residences on the two floors above. Most of the buildings in Old Town have been limited to about three floors in height except for those churches and public buildings with spires and towers.
In New Town and the Wenceslas Square area there is a change to building heights in the five to seven story range. New Town is what the Wenceslas Square area is called which is not that new given that many of the buildings date back to the early 1900s.
Along the way back we found these Baroque style influences on Národní and Michalská streets. Note here another door within a door leading to an interior courtyard.
In Closing I’ll share that we found time to relax on a few evenings, me with a good book, and my wife painting. We spent five full days in Prague walking several miles a day to tour Old Town and the surrounding areas. With a redeye flight on the way over we found that the jet-lag is real when it finally hit requiring about 10 hours sleep the first night and making up the rest with an extra hour or two a night through the week.
Prague is a beautiful and historic city and well worth exploring in person. If you have not been there then be sure to put it on your list of future adventures.

“Prague is overrun with tourists! Prague was beautiful until it got popular! Prague is not what it used to be!”
Chances are you’ve heard someone say these phrases if you’ve expressed an interest in visiting Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. But if you know where to look and how to look, you can get the best out of any ‘over-visited’ city. Look no further than this article for the only 3 experiences you’ll ever need in Prague.
Yes, most of us know to avoid the restaurants which have ‘Authentic’ in its title. Yet there’s so many around in the touristy areas and everyone seems to be having a good time, ‘seems’ being the operative word. Before our trip, I got on to Google, used our hotel as the base and searched for restaurants near it. I only clicked on the ones closest to the hotel AND also which had at least 4 stars and over 1000 reviews. That’s how I found Restaurace Mincovna, a stellar traditional restaurant just steps away from Old Town Square. The service was impeccable, the menu was accessible and varied, and the portions were hearty and plentiful. Washed down with good Czech beer, we had dinner here on two nights, and everything was…

Immersed in history, overflowing with charm, and speckled with orange-topped roofs lies the city of Prague in the Czech Republic. Whether you love castles, architecture, or are just in need of a good beer, Czech Republic’s most popular city is one of the most interesting in Europe.
Prague has tonnes to offer with regards to culture, architecture, food, and drink; it has been on the tourist map for decades, and the crowds show no signs of dwindling down.
The Czech have a wonderful spirit. You really do get a feeling that they are not just putting up with all the tourists but instead embracing it, and want to show off their beautiful city. One of the most mind-blowing facts is their beer consumption; which may have something to do with their positivity. According to a local citizen there, the average Czech citizen consumes 300 litres of beer a year. They are serious about their beer and I am all for it! They know how to have and show you a good time. Prague is the perfect place to relax, explore, and get a feel for the history of Europe.
A map of some of the places mentioned in the blog.

Traditional Czech food might be very meaty, but that doesn’t mean that vegans have it tough here. In fact, there are many vegan-friendly places in Prague that even my staunchest meat-eater friends can’t resist.
What are those? Here’s a local’s perspective on some of the plant-based food in Prague in 2025.
Whether you’re looking for Czech classics with a vegan twist, international cuisine, or budget-friendly options, this guide has you covered.
Eaternia is a popular vegan diner in Prague and genuinely one of my favorite places to eat ever. The first time I had their burger? I almost cried. That’s how good their food is! It’s been two years, but my sister and I still talk about that incredible culinary experience to this day.
Menu highlights: The burger menu, obviously. But they also always have traditional Czech desserts and cakes (all 100% vegan) that I would recommend trying.
Location: Prague 5 — Smíchov. About 7 minutes away from the Smíchov Train Station.
For the cool diner vibes, including a classic jukebox and funky wallpaper in the restrooms. And the burgers! Have I mentioned the burgers?
Střecha is the place for everyone and anyone wanting to experience traditional Czech food with a vegan twist. It’s a cooperative restaurant run by formerly homeless people and ex-convicts, supporting their reintegration into society.
Basically, if you eat here, you’ll get to:
Menu highlights: Svíčková, aka soy sirloin in creamy vegetable sauce with traditional Czech dumplings. Personally, I’m also a big fan of the Budvard goulash.
Location: Nové město. You can get here by metro (line B, station Národní třída) or tram (station Lazarská).
Střecha is affordable, welcoming, and one of the most famous vegan restaurants in Prague.
Safe Space Bookstore & Café is a relatively new spot in Prague (it only recently celebrated its first birthday), but it’s quickly become one of my favorites. This place is a unique vegan café and queer-friendly bookshop all in one.
There are always fun and inclusive events on, too, so if you’re looking for a quick vegan lunch, snack, or cocktail alongside some entertainment, why not check out Safe Space?
Menu highlights: Traditional Czech spreads and snacks, including the strange “Czech hot dog.”
Location: Žižkov. Get here by bus, tram, or walk from Florenc Bus Station (about 12 minutes).
If you’re looking for some LGBTQ+ friends or just want an affordable place that has both delicious food and interesting books for you to peruse, Safe Space is the spot for you.
If you like your dining on the bougier side, you have to go to Palo Verde. This Prague vegan bistro is perfect for fancy brunches and celebratory dinners. My sister took a group of her friends here for her birthday, and it was honestly the perfect spot for the occasion!
Menu highlights: Personally, I really enjoyed their kimchi omelette and have heard great things about the red pesto lasagna.
Location: Palo Verde is located in Nové Město, close to the Muzeum metro station (line C).
Cozy spot. Friendly staff. Fancy vibes. Also, they have board games you can borrow and play!
Let’s stick with the brunch theme! CHUTNEJ is a spot I kept getting recommended over and over again, until I finally gave in. And it’s a good thing that I did. This spot is amazing, and it’s no wonder it has such a great reputation among other Prague vegans.
It’s not just a brunch spot, either. You can get dinner here, too, as well as some delicious coffee.
Menu highlights: The above-pictured traditional Czech “loupák.” I used to eat these a lot as a kid, and it was amazing to see them again in a fully vegan café.
Location: Holešovice. Take the tram to Letenské náměstí.
The way people rave about this place, why would you not want to visit CHUTNEJ?
Imaginární zmrzlina is the only place that’s managed to get me excited about ice cream in recent years. And there’s a reason for that. This place genuinely has some of the best ice cream ever. Whether you’re a fan of traditional flavors or prefer more adventurous options, this tiny café has it all.
Menu highlights: The poppy ice cream. Just trust me on this.
Location: Karlín, near the Florenc bus and metro stations.
This is the best ice cream I’ve had in years. And I mean that.
Loving Hut isn’t exactly for those of you looking for a fine-dining experience, but it is a staple in Prague’s vegan restaurant scene. It’s an affordable vegan buffet chain that offers a variety of Asian-inspired dishes.
Here, you serve yourself. Just pick up a box or a plate and load it with whatever you fancy. You pay by weight here, which makes it perfect for those of you on a budget.
Menu highlights: Noodles, curries, dumplings, sushi, and more.
Location: There’s a bunch of these all over Prague, including Národní třída and Karlín.
If you’re on a budget or in a rush but still want to eat out, try one of these buffets!
Pastva is a small vegan restaurant in Prague that I can wholeheartedly recommend. I took my friend from the UK here, and we had some delicious “langoše” here (as pictured above). We were stuffed by the end of the meal, but I’m fully planning to come back and try some of their tasty-looking desserts.
Menu highlights: Langoš, which is a beloved dish in Czechia. Their risottos look incredible, too!
Location: Anděl, Prague 5. Close to the Anděl metro station (line B).
For the stylish atmosphere, comfort food, and craft cocktails, of course.
Similar to Loving Hut, Dhaba Beas is an affordable chain of vegetarian and vegan buffets that you can find all over Prague. Most of the meals are India-style, and while I wouldn’t exactly call them authentic, many of them really do hit the spot if you’re looking for someone quick and easy.
Menu highlights: They have these little soy pieces in peanut sauce that are to die for.
Location: Trust me, Dhaba Beas is everywhere. If you walk around Prague city center for 15 minutes, you’re bound to find at least one. But just in case, here’s a map of all the different locations.
It’s super affordable, and you pay per weight here, too, so there’s less danger of unnecessary food waste.
Last but not least, we have Linh’s Vegan Corner, a place that I just can’t resist. This Asian-style restaurant has a super comprehensive menu. As vegans, we’re often used to not having too many options. But not here. This place has a lot on offer, and it’s honestly a struggle to just pick one or two things each visit.
(Maybe that’s why I always end up ordering from this restaurant above most others.)
Menu highlights: I’m obsessed with the Black Magic Udon. Also, the traditional vegan honey cake here is a must!
Location: Vinohrady, aka one of the coolest parts of Prague.
Their Instagram says that this place is just like a fairy tale, and I have to agree. It’s that good.
Got some questions? Here are some answers.
A: Yes! As this guide shows, Prague has a blossoming vegan scene where you can find everything from casual buffets to cool brunch spots and bougie restaurants (perfect for those Instagram travel pics).
A: Go to Střecha for amazing vegan versions of Czech classic dishes like svíčková (sirloin with creamy sauce), bread and potato dumplings, and beer goulash.
A: Yes! Try Loving Hut and Dhaba Beas for quick vegan meals under €10.
A: Palo Verde and CHUTNEJ are definitely up there. Or, if you’re a member of the LGBTQ+ community (or an ally), head to Safe Space for books and brunch!
A: Definitely! Most of the popular, big grocery stores like Albert, Lidl, Billa, and Tesco have all you could possibly need, including plant-based milk, meat alternatives, tofu, tempeh, and vegan snacks. Albert has vegan pastries, too, which are great if you’re looking for a quick snack. Other than that, DM Drogerie is also a good place if you’re looking for some fancier vegan products.
A: No! Most restaurant staff in Prague’s vegan restaurants and cafés speak English. In fact, most Czechs speak English, especially those who live in Prague. They’ll probably be happy they get to practice their language skills with you.
Whether you’re looking for traditional Czech dishes or international cuisine, Prague has a ton of vegan options available to you. This list featured some of my and my friends’ favorite spots, but there are many more. So feel free to explore the city and enjoy the best of vegan food that Prague has to offer.
And please, do let me know if you try any of these spots — or if you have other favorites that I forgot to mention.

Some cool historical stuff to know about Prague before you go
Defiant. Resilient. Betrayed. Those are the words that come to mind as I walk through the streets of Prague for the first time and learn about this historic city on the Vltava River.
It is hard not to experience Prague and feel the weight of history that bears down of the city and the Czech people, who over the course of the last nearly 700 years, have been ruled for a majority of that time by other states, nations and empires.
Prague got off to a really strong start in the 14th Century under King Charles IV, who strengthened the economy, started the first university in Central Europe and expanded the Prague Castle, including starting construction of St. Vitus Cathedral. He also commissioned the famous bridge across the Vltava, which was started on July 9, 1357, at 5:31 a.m. when he laid the first stone. This is well known because the date and time create a numerical palindrome (1–3–5–7–9–7–5–3–1), which meant something to Medieval numerologists, who must have been on to something because the original bridge is still standing strong, 668 years later.
Despite its promising start as the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Prague fell into the hands the Hapsburgs, when Ferdinand I was elected by the Bohemian nobility as king after their ruler, King…

Cafe Louvre — The doors of the Café Louvre first opened in 1902. The restaurant still preserves the old café traditions. So even today you can still enjoy the unique atmosphere of a historical, grand café, as Franz Kafka, Albert Einstein or T. G. Masaryk knew it.
Everything on the menu is wonderful, and the outdoor seating is a magnificent welcome to Prague.
Walk across Charles Bridge over the Vltava River to find yourself in Malá Strana or the Lesser Town
But before you cross the bridge stop at GOOD FOOD, the holy grail of Trdelniks.
Climb up the Charles Bridge Lookout Tower for a view of both sides of the river before you walk to the other side.
Do the “hike” up to the Prague Castle. We skipped out on the tour, but the view from the very top is nothing short of incredible — great if you enjoy history and architecture!
Check out the Golden Lane, a narrow and scenic alleyway that used to house goldsmiths’ workshops. Painting a picture of the past, you see how people used to work and live as you enter the recreated workshops. Franz Kafka, the…

Prague is the capital and the largest city of the Czech Republic, a landlocked country in Central Europe. The historical capital of Bohemia is thousand-year-old. Famous for its amazing architecture and beer. Yes, Czechs love beer and if you too, this is paradise. The country has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world.
Introducing Prague´s sightseeing places:
Prague has great train connections, you can include this destination on your Interrail trip.
www.interrail.eu
On the first day, we were happily walking around and getting lost in Prague´s tiny streets. The cloudy weather gave the day a special taste.

On the second day, we went straight to the Castle and took the time to explore all its churches, castles, towers and gardens. The biggest ancient castle in the world is the Prague Castle and it was built in the 9th century. Home for the kings of Bohemia, Holy Roman Emperors, presidents of Czechoslovakia, and nowadays the President of Check Republic.

As a Master’s student living in Munich for almost a year, I hadn’t ventured outside of Germany much, except for a brief visit to Maastricht. After finishing my exams two weeks ago, my friends and I decided to take a weekend trip to Prague. Being students, we couldn’t afford a longer trip without stretching our finances, and we all had commitments the following week. So, we planned a straightforward two-day trip, determined to make the most of our limited time.
Our plan was simple: catch a Flixbus from Munich to Prague at 7 a.m. on Saturday, arriving at noon, and return by 8 p.m. on Sunday. We booked a hostel near the city center so we could explore Prague on foot without worrying about public transportation. It seemed foolproof — what could go wrong?
Well, things didn’t go quite as planned. We all made it to the bus on time, only to discover that the seats we had booked together in row 20 didn’t exist. The bus wasn’t configured as expected, and when we asked the Flixbus employee, he simply shrugged, saying there wasn’t much they could do. So, we reluctantly sat in random seats, separated from each other.
The journey was supposed to be straightforward, but when we made a stop in Regensburg, things took a turn. The bus, already nearly full when we left Munich, was supposed to be a two-story vehicle, but instead, it was a single-story bus. At Regensburg, there were many passengers waiting to board, but not enough seats. It quickly became clear that there had been a mix-up. The employees informed the waiting passengers that they’d have to wait for the next bus, which would arrive in two hours. This didn’t sit well with two elderly Ukrainian women who boarded the bus and refused to get off until the next bus arrived. As a result, we were all forced to wait for two hours.
Frustrated by the delay, we decided to grab some coffee to stay awake, as we were all pretty tired from the early start. While waiting outside the bus, a young Canadian couple approached us, asking for directions to the bakery where we had bought our coffee. The guy went to get their drinks, while the girl stayed and joined our conversation. We learned that they were from Quebec and had been exploring Europe for a week, also heading to Prague. When the guy returned, we chatted for about an hour, discussing everything from European culture to the situation with the two Ukrainian women holding up our trip.
About 20 minutes before the other bus was due to arrive, a shy teenage girl slowly joined our conversation. We found out she was from Prague and had been taking a German course in Regensburg. Her local knowledge came in handy, and we asked her for recommendations on what to see and do in Prague.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the second bus arrived, and the extra passengers boarded. We resumed our journey, but by the time we reached Prague, I was in desperate need of a bathroom. After handling that situation, we checked in at our hostel, which was conveniently located near the city center. The hostel was basic, a small room on the 5th floor with four beds and no windows, but thankfully it had air conditioning, as the weather was quite warm.
We took quick showers and headed out to explore the city. By then, it was already 3 p.m., so we started with a checking out the exterior of the National Czech Museum, right next to our hostel. Prague’s architecture immediately captivated us — vibrant colors, tiled streets, and historic buildings at every turn.
Feeling hungry, we went to a Czech restaurant recommended by the girl we met on the bus and tried traditional dishes like Svíčková and Czech goulash, accompanied by the famous Czech beer. Fun fact: the Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world, which was surprising to learn, given that I live in Bavaria.
After our meal, we made our way to the Old Town Square, passing the quirky Dancing House and numerous tourists along the way. We couldn’t resist trying Trdelník, a sweet treat made of a cinnamon roll-like cone filled with ice cream and fruits. Delicious as it was, it attracted a lot of bees — something to keep in mind if you ever try it!
At the Old Town Hall, we met up with the Canadian couple again to see the Prague Astronomical Clock. Afterward, we walked through the city, crossing the beautiful Charles Bridge over the Vltava River, surrounded by stunning views and people enjoying boat rides. We decided to save the boat ride for the next day and continued towards Prague Castle. The hike up to the castle was challenging, but the view was worth it. Although the ticket booth for the castle interior was closed, we explored the castle grounds and admired the colorful, doll-like houses on Golden Lane.
By this point, we had walked nearly 15 kilometers and were ready for dinner. After trying several places that were either full or had closed kitchens, we found a laid-back burger place where we ate and drank until 11 p.m. Exhausted, we finally called it a day and returned to our hostel.
The next day, we started with breakfast at a local café, then headed to the Czech National Museum. This museum was incredible, with rooms dedicated to everything from minerals and history to World War II and various species of animals. We spent four hours there, completely absorbed in the exhibits.
After the museum, we met up with the Canadian couple again for a planned boat ride on the Vltava River. However, the boat operator warned us of an impending storm, which we didn’t believe at first because the weather seemed fine. Fast forward a little, and we were running through the rain to the nearest restaurant. The storm dashed our hopes for the boat ride, but we found a fantastic Italian restaurant where we spent the next two hours waiting for the rain to subside, enjoying great pizza, beer, and conversation.
As the rain eased, we reluctantly made our way back to the bus station, still a bit wet and tired. Despite a half-hour delay, the return bus ride was uneventful, and we finally arrived in Munich at 3 a.m., facing long routes home via public transport.
Despite the challenges and setbacks, the trip to Prague was incredibly satisfying. The city left a lasting impression, and I’m already eager to return to explore more — like the Jewish Cemetery, beer bath, Sex Machine Museum, Beer Museum, Ice Bar, Torture Museum, and many more fascinating places.
I’m writing this recollection of my trip to Prague in order to preserve the beautiful memories I had. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

The Charles bridge is one of the busiest spots in Prague because of its beautiful gothic structure and central location. If you wanna avoid the crowds, head over later in the day as it gets dark. But if you’re looking for a souvenir or a performance make sure you get there before 4 to see the street performers work their magic or buy a painted picture of the city’s scenery. For the best views on the Charles Bridge, take in a sunset view or climb the tower at the foot of the bridge for just 100 Czech crowns (around 5 U.S. dollars) for some beautiful views at the top.
The Prague castle is one of the most visited spots in Prague and it boasts incredible architecture at the top of a hill offering spectacular views. Head there on a weekday for less crowds. If you’re traveling on a budget you can get inside the back area for free, or pay a small fee to get closer up to the front and see the whole thing. To avoid walking up the big hill, take the tram up the hill and walk back down for the beautiful views.
This monastery has been named the most beautiful library in the world. Go just two tram stops beyond the Prague Castle for a chance to see the beautiful painted ceilings. The monastery does have a charge to go inside, as well as a small fee to be able to take pictures of the inside. Also note that you cannot go fully inside the rooms but can get a view beyond a roped off area.
The dancing house is a marvel of Czech modern cubist architecture along the Vlatva river. Take a tour of the museum and gallery or ride the elevator to the top floor for a restaurant and outdoor deck. Just order a drink or some food and get access to the outdoor viewing area with a 360 view. Fun fact: you can see 9 different bridges in the distance from the top of Dancing House!
For one of the most iconic Prague sights, head to Old Town Square and the astronomical clock tower. A huge crowd gathers as the time reaches the hour and people wait for the clock to change. Get there 15–20 minutes early for the best views. The clock also has an inside museum that gives you its history and lets you see the other side of the characters that pop out of the clock.
Wenceslas Square has been called the Times Square of Prague. It’s just a short walk from Old Town and named after the Czech Saint Wenceslas. It has a combo of shops and restaurants, with several traditional Czech restaurants as well as street food. Right in the heart of Wenceslas Square is also a bustling nightlife with a variety of clubs and bars that stay open late and attract large crowds. You can also hope to catch an outdoor food festival, held seasonally and offering street food like sausages and hot wine and beer.

Vienna, Slovakia, Budapest and Prague are very common tourist stops in the central Europe vacation circuit. The architecture has similar trends (some cities survived the World Wars better than others), their history is tied together by royal families, common wars and the development of governments as they stand today.
We really enjoyed our guide and the history lesson she shared on our walking tour in Prague. She explained they had three massive invasions in the last few decades: first, by the Germans who stripped their culture and language and replaced it with German. Second by the Soviets who drew the iron curtain for many years. And then most recently by tourists… who have come to explore this relatively new country (it separated from Slovakia in 1993) and is still trying to solidify its routines for decades before.
We also learned a few shocking pieces of history… Prague is actually one of the best preserved cities in Europe. Why you ask? Because Hitler wanted to retire in Prague. So he didn’t bomb it.
It was only bombed twice: once by the Americans by mistake (funny right?), who thought they were bombing Dresden in Germany. Both cities are super close, and I guess they just made the mistake. And then by the Nazis, two days before the end of the war. But not much was destroyed.
Another one that is even more grim — Prague has the best preserved Jewish quarter in Europe. And that is because Hitler wanted to keep it as a museum of the extinct Jewish race. Yeah, pretty dark stuff.
Lots was absorbed here. We met some great people and hung out a few times during our stay as well as had the chance to watch the most crazy football match… England vs. Croatia with a bar that had hundreds of UK fans!! A few thousand people in a biergarden outside, mostly intoxicated. Whenever a team would score a goal, beers were flying in the air. Full beers, I should mention. A 0.5L beer in Prague costs about 2$, so people are not too careful when they challenge gravity with it. We went back home covered in ale.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
Sigmund Freud likes to hang around. 😉 Fun fact: this was a statue in memory of his crazy experiments, and caused a high call volume of 911 calls in the city as locals and tourists assumed it was a real person.
“Why don’t you Taj Mahal the shit out of it?” is what the Rolling Stones said when they decided to paid for the lights on the Prague Castle since at night in the 1990’s, since it had no lights on it until then.
The Summer Palace, and the astronomer who made discoveries from this location was killed by a blater infection… as he was too nervous to go to the bathroom and leave his meal with the king…
England vs. Croatia semi-final game at a beer garden in Prague. All I can say is that UK fans are crazy…and a few beer showers were had.

Ah Prague,
Forget Paris being the city of love. Prague, in my opinion, takes the prize! It’s one of the most well-preserved and beautiful cities in the world. I’ve had the pleasure of visiting several times and I never seem to get bored! There is always something new to discover or somewhere new to explore. Despite the cobblestones causing me to stumble every few steps or almost being hit by a tram, I have fallen in love with this charming medieval city.
Since my first trip there at sixteen, which was a bazillion years ago, I have been back 5 times. And no matter how many times I visit, I never seem to shake off the feeling that I am walking through a fairytale. I still haven’t found prince charming, but the hunt isn’t over!
Everything from the historical bridges to the hidden cobblestoned alleyways to the vibrant buildings, Prague really is a place that should be on everyone’s bucket list.
To inspire your inner wanderlust, and hopefully get you to start planning your trip to Prague, these are the things that made me fall in love with the city. If this list doesn’t convince you, I don’t know what will!
Walking through Prague feels like visiting a neverending history museum. It’s one of the very few European cities not destroyed by the World War II bombings, so most of the architectural beauty is original and more than eight centuries old. Each building has a distinct style and color, and to me, that is one of the things that makes this city so special. I love walking around and imagining who lived in them right after they were built or what they were used for.
A few of my favorite architectural gems are Charles Bridge, National Theater, and Municipal House. Prague is best explored by ditching the map and just getting lost. You never know what you might find.
Prague has a reputation for being one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and there is no better way to experience that beauty than from an elevated vantage point. There are so many places to get spectacular views, you really can’t go wrong. My personal favorite is the Letna Park Beer Garden. On a warm day, it’s the perfect spot to grab a cold beer and gaze out at the picturesque city below or better yet, watch the sunset. There is no better way to end your day.
One of my favorite aspects of Prague is the vibrancy. It’s a city with so much going on day in and day out and can be overwhelming to pick and choose where to go and what to do, but being in a city with too much choice has never been a bad thing in my book. Let’s just hope indecisiveness isn’t your weakness because then you might have a problem.
Prague’s mystery is one I have yet to crack, and I hope to keep it that way. With a history dating back over 2000 years and the fact that all the buildings are original and intact, makes it one of the most interesting, spellbinding and mysterious cities in Europe. I always seem to discover a new part of the city every time I visit.
These days, finding cheap destinations in Europe has become more difficult. Unfortunately, Prague isn’t as cheap as some of it’s Eastern European neighbors, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not one of the more affordable places to visit. You can easily find budget-friendly activities and restaurants scattered all over the city.
One of my favorite resources for finding budget-friendly things to do is Like a Local. Locals will give you tips on restaurants, attractions, shopping and nightlife and a lot of times they will recommend places that tourists don’t normally know about. You can save quite a bit of money if you are willing to venture out of the city center.
Smazeny Syr is a delicious traditional Czech food you can’t leave Prague without trying. This fried cheese dish is found pretty much everywhere from the simplest food cart to the classiest restaurant. Fast food places will usually serve it as a sandwich, which makes for a pretty amazing snack after a night out, but most commonly it is served on its own with a side salad or potatoes. Don’t order it on your first day because you might not want to try anything else.
Is there anything like watching a sunset after a busy day of sightseeing? I personally think it’s the best way to finish off a day. Ohhh, that rhymes! Prague has several vantage points where you can witness mother natures phenomenon. Many of the places will have cafes where you can grab a drink, find a seat as you watch the sun slowly sinking below the horizon.
A few of my favorite spots to watch the sunset are, Letna Park, Stefanikuv Most (a bridge with less foot traffic than Charles Bridge), Vyšehrad, and Prague Castle. Although watching the sunset with Prague Castle in the background is pretty incredible.

My Guide in the Czech Republic (main part Prague)
In this article, I am going to answer the FAQ about Prague and give you some tips about the city.
I have been living in the city for 4 years and whenever I go for a walk in the old town, I feel like it is my first time visiting the city. That’s why I decided to work as a tour guide for a while. I don’t do it anymore, except private tours from time to time.
So, let Is go through the things that you want to know before coming to the Magical City.
*I will recommend videos to watch or website(s) to visit in each section, some of the videos may don’t have accurate information such as exchange rate but the information is useful no matter when you come to Prague ;)
The Czech Republic is not in the eurozone, the official currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech crown (Kč/ in English CZK). 1 euro is around 25CZK. You will find a link to the Czech National Bank and to a website with the best exchange point in Prague in the end of this section.
Coins: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 CZK * All the coins are useful (not the case with euros — 1cent, 2cent, 5cent) Banknotes: 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 CZK
*You should avoid the 2000 and 5000 banknotes for small purchases.
Although CZK is the official currency in the Czech Republic, you still can pay by Euro almost everywhere specially in Prague. However, you will not get the best exchange rate except in the international chains (supermarkets, coffee chains, fast-food chains, …).
Czech National Bank
How to exchange money by (Honest Guide)
Prague without cash by (Honest Guide)
Public transport is efficient in Prague in a way that you don’t need a rental car or taxis. Actually, it is cheaper and faster xD. There are 3 lines of Metro, 10s of tramways, and 100s of buses.
The tickets for a single trip are for 30 minutes (for 24czk) or 90 minutes (for 32czk). The daily ticket (24h) is for 110czk and if you are here for 3 days (72h) your ticket costs 310czk.
*If you are willing to stay more than 5 days, I recommend buying a monthly ticket for 570czk
For more details check these videos:
How to buy a ticket (Honest Guide)
Travelling around the city (Honest Guide)
Prague Public Transport at Night (Honest Guide)
How to get from Prague’s airport to the city center (Honest Guide)
GOING TO PRAGUE BY TRAIN OR BUS (Honest Guide)
To find transport connection, check out this website (they have also mobile app) www.idos.cz
To rent bikes use Rekola, but you will need a credit card to use the app.
You can use Uber and yeah it is possible to pay by cash or taxi companies like Tick Tack, Nejlevnější Taxi or MODRÝ ANDĚL (if you went out with your car and end up drinking beers with your friends, they can give you a ride for you and your car xD at night).
*Ride for the airport to the city center should cost you around 500czk (20 euro), be careful from scams.
You have many options such as Hotels, Hostels, Airbnb, apartments, etc. I am going to describe the different areas by character so that it helps you choosing the right place.
Old town : you won’t need transportation since everything is close to you. However, a lot of going on around and there is a big possibility that you won’t have a calm night.
Lesser town (malá strana) : It is near the castle, Charles Bridge and many beautiful parks. You will need transportation and there are almost no supermarkets nearby (most of the prices are for tourists).
New Town : A great neighborhood, restaurants and cafés are excellent in the area. Most of your neighbors are tourists, those who hurry up are called the locals. You will need transportation and fortunately there are two metro stations in the area and many tramways pass by that zone.
The rest of the areas are cheaper, calmer (exception: Žižkov) and most of the residents are locals, so you won’t be scammed.
During my work as a tour guide, I met tens of people who planned their stay in Prague just one day or two days and double of that period in Budapest (sometimes more time for Bratislava than Prague :D). I think you know what I am going to say by now. Minimum days to spend in Prague should be 3 or 4 days. If you want to enjoy the city and yourself, one week to 10 days.
Plan A — 3 days:
You should not enter every monument/museum in your way. Consider taking transportation so that you won’t be tired by the end of the day.
Plan B — royal stay:
Life is good, you have enough time to visit the main monuments, party, enjoy the traditional Czech cuisine and save energy for the next city/country.
Plan Z — Underestimated city / just 1 night or even less
You can start by Prague Castle (don’t spend more than 60 -90 minutes in that area)than follow the Royal way (Coronation route). Next stop will be Charles Bridge that will lead you to the old Town Square. You should be tired by now from walking, so reward yourself by a hot coffee in Skautský Institut or another place (avoid the coffees in the square if you don’t want to be scammed) .
You should have enough time to enjoy a traditional dish. Later on, go to Wenceslas Square.
*This can be done the other way around (from Wenceslas Square to the Castle, but I recommend the first direction because Prague Castle in on the top of the Hill).
COOLEST DISTRICT in PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
1000czk without accommodation is fair enough. I will tell you why :
Transport: 110czk for 24h
Food: 600czk (150–200 per meal)
Coffee&cake: 150czk (coffee for 50czk, cake for 100czk)
The rest can be used for entrance to museum (sometimes it will cost you 250 czk, but generally around 150czk or less)
The list is so long, you should make your priorities. If you like museums, Prague offers museum for any kind of thing (Torture, toys, chocolate, Lego, Apple Inc.,). You love outdoors?.. well Prague offers that too, but if you can’t stand cold weather, you should visit the City during Spring or Summer Season.
The must visit list that I recommend is the following:
Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, Old Town Square, Prague Zoo, Wenceslas square, National museum, etc.
However, those are the typical ones, there are other monuments and places to visit. Check out the following videos:

SECRET PLACES IN PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
The traditional Czech cuisine is so authentic. The food is heavy, tasty and not healthy :D Main ingredients are meat (mainly pork), potatoes, cabbage and flour. So, don’t expect salads or vegetarian food.
The best thing that you will enjoy, in the Czech Republic, are snacks and cakes.
I recommend reading this article:
https://www.tasteofprague.com/pragueblog/traditional-czech-food-in-prague-what-to-have-and-where-to-have-it
Here is also a playlist of videos from Honest Guide that I recommend to watch (included vegetarian restaurants):
Restaurants in Prague (Honest Guide)
Safety:
The City is safe and secure, but be careful in the crowded areas. There are no ghettos or not recommended areas. The Czech Republic is one of the safest countries in the world 😊.
Halal food:
There are some restaurants that offer halal food. Most of them are near to the city center. Here is a list of the restaurants, I will try to cover all the areas in Prague:
Mangal Restaurant is located in the Wenceslas square. Address: Václavské náměstí 64, Praha
Barakat is near the mosque of the center. Address: Opletalova 28, Praha
Istanbul Kebab is also near the mosque of the center, less than 100 meters from Barakat. Address: Politických vězňů, 17, Praha
Jordan Restaurant in the lesser town (mala strana). So, if you are hungry and you still near the castle this should be your destination. Address: Malostranské náměstí 36/22, Praha
Safír is a good Lebanese restaurant. You can find it in different malls (OC Nový Smíchov, Arkády Pankrác, OC DBK — Budějovická , OC Chodov) * OC stands for Commercial Center. Here is their website http://www.isafir.cz , but it is not updated.
*if you are so into halal things, you should go 100% vegan in this country or buy expensive food from bio supermarkets/restaurants.
Different products use pork gelatin or other extracted products from pork. These products can be yogurt, sweet bakery (even croissant), etc.
If you want to have bolognaise or burger with mashed beef meat, make sure that is not mixed with pork (in non halal places).
Mosques:
Mosque of the center: Opletalova 930/28, 110 00 Praha 1 (be advised, it is located inside a building)
Mosque Alfirdaus : Na Košince 502/1, 180 00 Praha 8-Libeň
Mosque of Černý Most: Blatská 1491, 198 00 Praha 9
Other tips:
Keep in mind that the Czech Republic is in the CENTER of Europe and not in the East. Also avoid saying Czechia, no one like it.
Here are playlists (if you don’t want to watch all of them, I selected some videos from the playlist. You will find them below the playlists)

The first light of dawn slips through the curtains of our hotel room. I glance over at my girlfriend, already awake, her eyes tracing the soft glow filtering in. Neither of us know why we’re up so early. It’s not jet lag or the faint hum of the city outside. So maybe, it’s the anticipation of wanting to see a side of Prague that most visitors miss.
We step outside into the cool morning air. The cobblestones feel damp beneath our feet. Street lamps cast soft halos in the mist, and somewhere in the distance, a bird begins to sing. The city feels quiet, almost like it’s waiting for something to happen.
We turn the corner together and spot the Old Town Hall. Its underground played a pivotal role in the Prague Uprising against Nazism. Attached to it is the Astronomical Clock, a medieval wonder that shows the positions of the Sun, Moon, Earth, and Zodiac constellations.
Humanity has tried to measure time for millennia. From the Maya in Mesoamerica to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in the UK…

Prague is a beautiful city. The river flows through the heart of it with the Disney-looking castle perched atop a hillside in the background. Its baroque and romanesque architecture give it an air of elegance that is incredibly unique.
The Old Town Square is the main area boasting beautiful buildings and the famous Orloj, an astronomical clock that sings at the top of every hour. It was teeming with tourists, so we didn’t stay too long in that area. And, unfortunately similar to Amsterdam, many of the streets were overflowing with trash and graffitied walls, which degraded the beauty of the city. In addition, overwhelming crowds and poor weather influenced our perception of Prague. It was obscenely hot the first few days, which gave us limited time to prance about before the sun scorched down on us and we had to take refuge inside shady cafes. But, the last few days cooled off and it even started raining out of the blue so we had to take cover again.
Despite an abundance of tourists and hot weather, we found that the best way to enjoy ourselves was by venturing out of the main town squares and finding solace along the side streets. Wandering along Old Town’s cobblestone streets was a great way to spend our time because we felt like this was more of an ideal way to experience this archetypal European city. I also had a chance to discover a specialty of Czech desserts: the trdelník chimney. It’s a funnel-cake filled with soft-serve ice cream and smells like a cinnamon roll. You can often find bakers on the streets baking the dough on a rotating spit then rolling it in cinnamon and sugar before filling it up with soft-serve. It was delicious confection for any sweet-tooth to enjoy!
In Vrtba garden, I got to see a photoshoot with a fashion model walking throughout the grounds. And I followed in her footsteps popping some poses myself.
We also got a great view walking up the steps of the Italian-style gardens and seeing the city beyond them. But, the best sights (and sounds) were yet to come…
The walk to Prague Castle was one of our favorite parts of the city. First, we started the walk from the Powder Tower, then up and over Charles Bridge. Charles Bridge is an attraction all by itself. Built in the 14th century, it’s lined with: sculptures of religious images and prolific Czech figures, street performers, artists and peddlers. It provides some of the most scenic views of the city over the Vltava River.
After crossing the bridge, we wound through cobblestone lanes and then climbed 200+ steps up to the castle entrance. Though the hike up to the castle is a bit of a workout, it’s worth it to get a spectacular view of Prague. In particular, the view at the top from the Starbucks (yep, you read that correctly; they pick the best locations!) situated in an outdoor patio setting overlooking the city was incomparable.
Once we arrived at Prague Castle, there’s no shortage of things to do. The compound includes a pretty expansive collection of eclectic buildings with museums, cafes, and archways connected by the internal castle roads. It’s a self-sufficient city unto itself similar to Windsor Castle. And, after the trek uphill we found a nice little offshoot area next to a cafe where we could sit, listen to a fountain, and cool off.
One of the best things we did was attend an organ concert in St. Vitus Cathedral, in the heart of the castle complex. St. Vitus is a 14th century Gothic church housing the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors. It’s also the home to a great organ that’s about 3 stories tall! We got to hear the prodigious instrument in all of its glory at a special evening concert. The booming sound of the pipes reverberated through the gothic arches making the church come alive! I can only imagine how awesome it must have been to the Bohemians back in the day when this baby was first installed. The event was unbelievably special, and I savored the moment listening to the sweet tempo and the rich tones of the organ. It has inspired me to start tickling the ivories once again!

A few days before Christmas, I received the Winter Holidays Edition of the Prague for Expats Newsletter. It began by saying:
“we hope you are enjoying snowy Prague, as it really is the best time for long walks through the city and its surroundings”
I was a little taken aback by this, and my initial reaction was to question whether the author had ever visited Prague in the snow. Actually, TBH, that was my second reaction. My first wasn’t suitable for a family-oriented blog! Like many cities, Prague, in the snow, is far from being a good place for long walks. It’s not even a good place for short walks, especially in the city centre or “historic Prague” as it’s called in the guidebooks. For several days that week before Christmas, I felt more locked down than during the official lockdowns during the pandemic. During the pandemic, we were just discouraged from going out, but the snow is a different matter, and like many locals, I dread snowfall in the deep midwinter. The cold I can handle, which is good because it can get mighty chilly! But, not the snow…
Sure, from the comfort of a room with a view, Prague is absolutely stunning under a shroud of pristine white snow. The hills surrounding the city take on a bleakness in the pale grey light, but the scenery becomes stunning when the skies turn blue. Be forewarned. Once you step outside, walking around Prague becomes a nightmare. In her 2011 song, “50 Words for Snow”, Kate Bush got really close to the mark with “anklebreaker”.
The problem is Prague's pavements combined with the huge footfall of thousands of tourists. It takes very little time for the white snow to turn into an ashy dirty wet sludge which on Prague’s mosaic pavements becomes a skating rink even before the wet sludge starts to refreeze. When it’s cold enough (as it was last week), the sludge quickly turns into invisible sheets of ice which are treacherous to both body and ego. Let’s face it; no one likes to look like a clown when they’re walking down a street full of people; it’s embarrassing enough when you can’t be seen!
But the problems don’t just come from under your feet. You’re constantly at risk of an attack from above as snow begins to melt on the rooftops, there’s a threat of baby avalanches, icicles spearing you and huge dollops of icy meltwater, which almost always seem to land on your glasses (or bald patches).
Prague city authorities are quick to get the gritting wagons and carts out, but this compounds the problem. Even after ten days, some of the more heavily gritted pavements are still covered in pin-sharp little stones which get stuck in the soles of your shoes and need to be picked out with that penknife attachment you never use for getting stones out of horse's shoes!
I have yet to find a single pair of shoes that can deal with Prague pavements regardless of the weather. Some are great in the summer; some work well in the rain, but none work well in any snow conditions — not even proper mountain boots! I had a pair of ECCO Gore-tex shoes which were the best all-rounders, but sadly, these have been decimated by five years of constant usage walking around the city.
So, don’t be fooled by the tour guides, the glossy guidebooks and the slick videos showcasing our beautiful city under a fresh fall of snow. Call up an Uber to take you to Petrin Hill, up to Prague Castle, or over to Vitkov Hill, walk a few hundred yards, and marvel at the panoramas. Then get back in your taxi and get comfy in the hotel bar until the thaw has completed.
Unless, of course, you really want to put the Czech health system to the test or find out how good your insurance is!

I suspect that on a clear day, when seen from the moon, Prague glitters like a sparkler. It seems like every Old-World store window gleams with crystal: bowls, bottles, bells, boxes, baskets, trays, vases, ladles, plates, jugs, wine glasses, brandy snifters, beer steins, cups and saucers, napkin holders, atomizers, and assorted tchotchkes.
All that glitter sparked an idea: Buy a chandelier.
Did it matter that all I had to carry souvenirs in was a daypack? That crystal chandeliers are made of hundreds of pieces of fragile and weighty glass? That I was already carrying 18 traditional, hand-painted, blown Czech Easter eggs?
No, it didn’t matter because my husband and I had just bought a charming Victorian house in San Francisco. The showpiece dining room featured a 10-foot-high ceiling, embossed wainscoting, a bay window, a built-in Victorian hutch, an antique dining table, and, suspended down from the flowery ceiling-rose disk in the middle of the dining room: an out-of-place, two-foot-diameter, Japanese paper lantern that looked like a glowing, white beach ball.
We needed a crystal chandelier.
But we were house-poor.
At home I had checked big-box stores and boutique lighting “shoppes,” but no chandeliers were less than $1,000, way out of our range.
Now I wandered in Prague, the Crystal Capital of the World.
My three-day trip was a personal reward after a rough week on a writing assignment in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Blocky, gray, Soviet-era architecture matched blocky, gray sky and overwhelmed the tiny historic quarter. I needed picturesqueness. I needed pizzazz. I needed Prague.
Staromestské námestí — Prague’s medieval-to-Renaissance Old Town Square — featured warm yellow, pastel blue, and soft peach baroque buildings with flat facades, pointed tops, and curving lines set in restful balance. Soulful violins and upbeat guitars from the lively music scene sent their melodies through the narrow alleys. Aromas of chicken paprikash, potato dumplings, and garlic soup from cafés and home kitchens comforted me.
Of course, I couldn’t possibly buy a chandelier. It was ridiculous enough that I imagined I could safely carry a dozen and a half hollowed eggs back to California, but their rich red and yellow colors, complex geometric patterns, and symbolism of protection seduced me.
In a shop up the hill toward Prazsky hrad — Prague Castle — crystal seduced me, too. I saw a chandelier for US$250 — including sea-mail shipping. For a day I agonized about the money, but the fact that it could be shipped — for free — finally won me over. Late in the afternoon I was leaving Prague, I made the commitment and returned to buy it.
A different clerk was on duty.
“Oh, no, we cannot possibly ship this sea-mail. This must go airmail,” he said. “That will cost $100 more.”
In the rapid switch to capitalism, the Czechs were clicking — but this development moved my chandelier out of reach.
Deeply saddened, I hurried down the hill because I needed to take the subway soon to catch the bus to the airport for the last flight to Bratislava. Across the Karluv most or Charles Bridge, which spans the River Vltava, I passed another lighting store.
A chandelier hanging in the window was perfect: hundreds of delicate crystals draped in rows — not ostentatious, not gaudy. It was 4,440 koruna or about US$185. Even adding air-mail costs it was acceptable.
I went inside. The middle-aged saleswoman spoke no English and I no Czech so we muddled through with my pathetic German and gestures.
She had no more chandeliers of that model. Could I have the one in the window? Yes. She was so kind. We took it down together. She found a battered, yellow, cardboard box — three feet square by two feet high. We stuffed it with newspaper and tied it with many swirls of string.
What were the costs for shipping? No shipping. No shipping? I would have to carry it.
I dashed to the money changer, checked my watch, waited in line, checked my watch again, and told the clerk how many koruna I needed. He told me how much that would be in U.S. travelers’ checks.
I got the cash, dashed back to the store — and the saleswoman pointed out that I was short by a few koruna.
Time was getting very tight now. I was glad I had already bought my subway pass.
I ran back to the money changer and explained the situation. He said, “Oh, I did not realize you needed exact amount for purchase.” I gave him another travelers’ check, he gave me more koruna, and I flew back to the store. Transaction finally complete, I checked my watch, waved a “Thank you!” and skedaddled.
Carrying my daypack with the blown eggs and struggling with the awkward box and its heavy glass contents, I waddled around the corner to the subway station. I had seen the station many times so was comfortable that all would work out now.
Down the steps I wobbled. Stairs to the lower level were boarded up. I traipsed around in search of others. No luck. The cavernous station held delis and clothing stores, but no information booth. My heart rate increased, and sweaty palms made it harder to grip the clumsy box.
I lumbered to a magazine stand. I couldn’t afford to wait in the long line. “Bitte, wo sind die Zuge?” I shouted in German. “Please, where are the trains?”
“Geschlossen,” said the harried clerk without looking my way.
“Geschlossen?” I said. “Closed? You can’t ‘close’ a train! I have to get to the bus for the airport!” You could take a train out of service, but this was a perfectly fine, obviously functioning subway station so you couldn’t just “close” a train.
“The station is closed,” said a tall, thin, dark-haired Czech man in his mid-30s standing next to me. The white plastic bag of vegetables he carried contrasted with his brown business suit. “The nearest station is . . . “ and then he said something like “up, left, right, street, around, under, right, blocks, down.”
Hyperventilation befuddled my brain. I stared at him.
He took the scruffy box and handed me the bag of vegetables. We hoofed up the stairs and dashed for several blocks through the streets of Prague, twisting left, turning right, ducking through breezeways, and finally ending up at the entrance to another subway station.
My benefactor then took his vegetables, handed me the box, and said something like “in, right, up, along, left, over, behind, across, right.”
Again, I stared at him.
Again, he grabbed the box, gave me the veggies, led me through the dark subway maze, and deposited me on a platform. He pointed in the direction the train would go. He placed the box on the platform, and I handed him his vegetables. I bubbled over with “thank you” and “danke schon” and “být zavázán tebe,” and he laughed as I got on the train.
So I made the bus and caught the flight but had to check the chandelier like a suitcase. The next morning before dawn I took another bus to Vienna and again had to check the chandelier as luggage on the flight home. I changed planes in New York; and when I arrived in San Francisco, the box was there — a little battered, but upright and more-or-less the same size.
I opened it and checked the 1,392 crystals. Only one had broken. All 18 of the eggs survived, too.
The chandelier shone beautifully in our Victorian dining room. When we moved nine years later, we took it with us — I couldn’t bear to leave it and all it represented.
As valuable and delicate as a crystal chandelier is, the more worthy — and fragile — factor is the kindness of human beings, and the memory I treasure most is of the smiling face and shining heart of the handsome Czech man with his suit and vegetables.

Discovering Beautiful Prague Hacks
Ahoj!
Now,if you have visited the beloved continent Europe ,you already know what a gem it is for travelers.It’s almost safe to say that it is every traveler's dream destination. Not only does it have over 40 countries to be explored (most without any visa restrictions)it offers a chance to experience rich history and cultures given most European countries have different languages.This said I put myself on a challenge to explore the world a little bit more,to experience other cultures and appreciate the diversity it brings through travel and what better time to do so whilst living in Europe.This brings me to why am writing this article,I fell in love with the beautiful city Prague ever since I embarked on a 4 day trip to celebrate my birthday. It left a lasting impression because of its beauty and rich history and would like to share some hacks and tips for first time travelers based on my experience there.
1 . Pick an accommodation location that minimizes traveling
Even though Prague is a fairly affordable city in terms of cost of living ,i’d recommend finding accommodation around the namesti republiky . Here you’ll find a vast amount of key monuments within its vicinity (Kotva Department Store, Municipal House, Powder Tower, Czech National Bank and Palladium shopping mall) . In addition all other key places e.g Prague castle,National Theater,Jewish Quarter are accessible by foot hence you save on the 32czk ticket that allows you 90 mins of travel using the buses/trams/metros. However should you choose an accommodation that requires you take the public transportation i’d highly recommend taking the 3 day pass ticket that costs 310 CZK.
This is not a sponsored article but am sharing the accommodation that I stayed and felt I really had value for money
emporio-prague-apartments.com
2. Be smart when it comes to currency conversion
If you are arriving from other country you should know that Czech doesn’t use Euros and instead uses Czech koruna(CZK). Hence prior to getting here I would recommend either have some loose cash around 5 euros to change at the airport exchange bureaus which give an awfully bad rate or pay your transportation by card. Please note the ticket machines only accept coins or card.Ticket cost from the airport to the Namesti republiky city center costs 32 CZK which is an equivalent of about 1.28 euros.
Recommended Exchange bureaus that had the most competitive rates eXchange, Kaprova 14/13, 110 00 Josefov, Czechia
Alfa Prague S.r.o., Na Příkopě 957, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
Another important thing to be mindful about is the cash withdrawals or payments when using cards because of the bank conversions. Locals have recommended that its better to pay in czk than your bank currency when using a card for payments.
3.Maximize your itinerary (Use the free maps shared either in hotels or airport!)
Am sure if you google what to do in Prague in x number of days you’ll find tonnes of information. Whilst this is nice as it gives you an idea of what is available I highly recommend that you pick up the free maps offered at the airports on your way out,they are really handy in giving you a visual of where the places you ought to visit are!! I got a really cool map at the airport that had listed all the key places to visit,metro line guide and Prague city tourism information. I found this to be truly useful as it enabled me make an optimized visit schedule since I could see the location of each place I wanted to visit and the proximity to other places.
4.Book a free tour prior to arriving
You’d be amazed at how much you learn about Czech through these free tours which at the end you give whatever amount you see best.
Fun fact : Did you know which music Neil Armstrong took to the moon? wait for it…Antonín Dvořák’s New World Symphony is the answer! :) .He was a famous Czech composer. I didn’t know this until i had this tour :p.
Link to the free tour that i used
freewalkingtourprague.eu
5.Eat,Explore,Reflect and Repeat
Travelling is fun but even better when we can use that chance to learn about a new culture and people. Explore the local foods and experiences ,you must agree having Italian cuisine in Prague is probably a not so good idea. Also take time to reflect and appreciate the precious moments and memories made in the new place.
My short recommended list of top foods and things to do
Hidden gem I stumbled upon :Restaurace U Dvou Velbloudů, Kožná 474, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
Hidden gem i stumbled upon :Naše maso, Dlouhá 727/39, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
There are two points at the Charles bridge that you can make a wish (Statue of St John Nepomuk and the statue in the picture below) :) i made my wish for …
If you are a lover for animals this is totally worth it !. For (250 CZK) as entrance fee, I got to see so many amazing animals and reconnect with mother nature through the trail walks.
Accessing the Prague castle courtyards and gardens is free. The golden lane is free to access after closing hours (please note that the houses aren’t accessible however). Whilst you have plenty to do I highly recommend buying one of the tickets to access some Prague castle structures.Depending on which circuit you choose you either pay 350 CZK or 250 CZK. I chose to go with the circuit B ticket that gave me access to the Old Royal Palace,Basilica of St.George,Golden Lane and the St.Vitus’s Cathedral. There is so much history in these places and for a moment at the golden lane I felt as if I traveled back in time.
There’s so much to share and this is definitely not exhaustive . However I shared my top hacks I believe are handy for first time travelers to Prague. Thank you for taking time to read this article and don’t forget to share your Prague stories.
Dekuji!!

A personal tour guide of Prague and Czech Republic

Prague is a hot destination for the movie production. And not only the city itself, but all Czech Republic. Especially in the last decades there are more and more foreign producers exploring the beauties of our country.
One of the main reasons why we are so popular are lower prices and tax incentives. Only in Prague you can find Barrandov movie studios, the largest film studio in the country and one of the largest in Europe, nicknamed “European Hollywood.” And, the most important, is the architecture. It offers the new and old, romantic and scary places. You do not need to travel anywhere else to find Venice, Paris or Vienna on the same street! :-)
Many, many movies were filmed in Prague and here I’m bringing you a few of them, in this limited space. It might be also a nice idea what to watch them prior coming to Prague ;-)
Mission: Impossible 1 (1996) and 4: Ghost Protocol (2011)
Nothing is impossible for Tom Cruise. To run across the Charles Bridge just within a few seconds or stealing from the Russians atPrague Castle. Large parts of these movies were shot not only in the historical centre (Old Town Square, National Museum, Wenceslas Square, Kampa Island, Municipal House…) but also in wider Prague areas — Vyšehrad Castle or Strahov Stadium.
Btw, Mission: Impossible 1 was the very first foreign movie made in Prague after the fall of communist regime.
Amadeus (1984)
Probably the best and the most known movie ever made in Prague is Amadeus. Filmed in 1984, so when we still had communistic regime, by Czech director Miloš Forman (who had to leave the country because of the same regime). The plot of the movie is set in Vienna, telling the story of two rival composers — Mozart and Salieri. It won eight Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director. That’s pretty good, isn’t it?
The best filming location to visit is the Estates Theatre, where the real Mozart premiered his opera Don Giovanni. Among others, try to stop in Wallenstein Garden, Strahov Monastery, St. Giles church or Colloredo — Mansfred Palace.
Casino Royale (2006)
Agent 007 had to make it to Prague one day, no doubt about it. Some of the place where he is walking, running and shooting were filmed in Strahov Monastery, National Museum or Prague Airport that was supposed to be… well, Miami Airport :)
Actually, most of the movie was shot in other towns, such as Loket and Karlovy Vary. Especially in Karlovy Vary, the movie makers decided to use again famous Grandhotel Pupp — that you might know from another movie, The Last Holiday with Queen Latifah and Gérard Depardieu.
Operation: Daybreak (1975) or Anthropoid (2016)
One of the most important moments in the history of WW2 is the arrival of the Butcher of Prague and his eventual assassination in 1942 by two Czechoslovakian paratroopers. There are several Czech movies dedicated to this operation. Speaking about those made in English language, you must watch Operation: Daybreak and the new Anthropoid movie, both filmed also on the authentic locations. They display the bravery of Czechs and how terrible price we had to pay.
To find out more about what really happened in 1942, join my Memorial Tour.
Child 44 (2015)
Movie based on a book that tells the story of the Russian military police (Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman) investigating a series of a child murders during the Stalin era in Russia. Movie makers decided to come to Prague especially because of the underground stations (dated back to communistic time) but also for the interiors. One of them is the National Museum. However, the director Ridley Scott did not like the facade of the National Museum and asked to repaint it. He was quite confused when the city did not allow him to do it. :)
Btw, did you know that for the filming, producers had to stop the operation of Prague’s underground? That happened for the first time in our history. You can imagine how locals were happy about it :)
Les Misérables (1998)
Probably the best version of Victor Hugo’s story and made in Prague! The cast is perfect, starring Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman or Geoffrey Rush and the setting even more splendid. For many travellers Prague really look like a small Paris and if not, it is easy to make by using film effects. That’s how the movie makers replaced St.Vitus Cathedral for Notre Dame de Paris in one scene, but in the other one you can see our Cathedral back again :)
Yentl (1984)
Barbra Streisand and the song “Papa, Can You Hear Me?”, who would not know it? It comes from the movie called Yentl that tells a story of a Jewish girl disguises herself as a boy to enter religious training. It won also one Oscar, Golden Globe and the nomination for Grammy Awards.
xXx (2002)
An extreme sports athlete, Vin Diesel, is recruited by the government on a special mission. The movie itself is nothing special, but the scene on Vltava river is pretty amazing. Also several sights from historical centre appear in the movies, such as Týn Church, Old Town Square, Municipal House or Charles Bridge.
And the winner for the Best Shot in Prague is…
The Best Offer (2013)
The story of an elderly man working in auctions, the collector or the painting, was mostly filmed in Italy. However, at the final of the movies, the main character (Geoffrey Rush) decides to come to Prague. He enters the room of the hotel, opens the window and the first thing he sees is the famous Astronomical Clock. What an amazing shot! Only afew seconds, but it makes you feel you need to come to this city. Watch and decide. :)
Btw, the restaurant mentioned in the movie. Night&Day, does not actually exist :)
Looking for more?
…and many more :)
Here you can see some photos from the streets of Prague, directly from the set. And try to guess what movies it is from :)

I’ve lived in Prague for 25 years, and I get asked pretty frequently about good things to do, so I figured I’d put it into a list.
In terms of events calendars, I’d check the Expats.cz (www.expats.cz) calendar, the Prague TV (www.prague.tv) calendar, and the Czech Tourism site (which is good, but kinda basic — http://www.czechtourism.com/home/).
Here’s something you might not know: Vietnamese culture is strong in Prague. Vietnamese are the third-largest ethnic minority in the Czech Republic (behind Slovaks and Ukrainians), and there are a number of places to get great Vietnamese food, including the sprawling SAPA marketplace (Anthony Bourdain visited there when he came to Prague a couple of years ago). SAPA is like a huge swap meet. It’s kind of hard to get to, but a really unexpected thing to find in Prague. (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/wKypyCh5AW32)
Barring that, I’d recommend visiting Banh Mi Makers on Dlouhá třida in the Old Town for a great Banh Mi sandwich. In fact, the building that houses Banh Mi Makers is a gourmet shopping center that also hosts one of the must-visit restaurants in town, the stand-up Naše Maso butcher shop Map: https://goo.gl/maps/XacKM4neyct. If you have enough lead time, I highly recommend reserving their ‘Noc s řezníkem (Night With A Butcher)’ an absolutely massive six-course
Just down Dlouhá, you have Lokal, which is a retro-style pub that serves some of the freshest Pilsner Urquell outside of Pilsen. And next door you have the Roxy and NoD spaces, which are great for catching a DJ gig or maybe a performance (check the website at www.roxy.cz).
In terms of vegetarian fare, I like the Maitrea restaurant near the Old Town Square, and Radost FX Cafe, and I highly recommend the Eska restaurant in the up and coming Karlin neighborhood. It just got a Michelin Bib Gourmand, and while it isn’t a strictly vegan restaurant, it’s a place that focuses on bread and things made with yeast or fermentation. It’s excellent.
One place that’s kinda touristy but still excellent is the rooftop bar at the Hotel U Prince, just off the Old Town Square. Walk into the hotel, all the way to the back, and you’ll find a glass elevator. Take that to the top and walk up some stairs, and you’ll be rewarded with one of the most spectacular views of the city you could ever imagine. And it’s even heated in the winter. https://www.terasauprince.com/terrace
The Maurer Grand Restaurant list (and app) has a ton of great restaurant recommendations too. http://www.grandrestaurant.cz/home/?lng=en
Prague has some great design shops if you know where to look. I especially like Tuzeks (http://tuzeks.eu/), which is a play on words on the old Communist hard-currency shops. Tuzeks sells retro Czech design (the lamps and chairs are great). https://goo.gl/maps/L7u5hKYkTG62
In the last couple of years we’ve seen a lot of design stores open up, and one of my favorites is the Chemistry Design Store (https://www.facebook.com/thechemistrydesignstore/), which has a lot of funky prints, glasswork, and some of the coolest turntables I’ve ever seen (made by 440 Audio — http://www.440audio.eu/). I also love the Modernista store in several locations, including the House of the Black Madonna. They specialize in faithful reproductions of Czech art deco, cubist and modernist pieces, and they’re gorgeous. http://www.modernista.cz/?lang=en
The Museum of Decorative Arts is also off the beaten path and is excellent, and has a wonderful museum shop, also run by Modernista (https://goo.gl/maps/1WdovwAG1Ro). Bonus: The windows, especially the ones in the stairways, overlook the Jewish Cemetery. I’m of two minds on whether the cemetery itself is worth going to. It’s usually mobbed, and it’s pretty pricey to get in. But the synagogues are beautiful. I’d instead recommend the small Jewish cemetery under the Zizkov TV tower. While there, you can check out the bar up on top of the TV tower, as well as checking out the Palac Akropolis, still my favorite concert venue in town, with two separate DJ bars.
I also like the scruffy Žižkov neighborhood where the Akropolis is located, which, pound for pound, has the highest concentration of bars, restaurants and cafes in town. That and the more upscale Vinohrady neighborhood next to it are good.
Being an old fart, I don’t get out as much as I’d like to. But when I do, I like the Naplavka riverwalk (https://goo.gl/maps/66HK8PEoGEH2) and the Krymska street neighborhood (https://goo.gl/maps/3PfbNjZEM5r). Naplavka is not so great in the wintertime, but is the place to be in spring and summer. And Krymska is ground zero for Prague hipsters. Pretty great.
Clubwise, some of Prague’s must-visit places include the Palac Akropolis (www.akropolis.cz), Roxy, Rock Cafe, Radost FX, and definitely the Cross Club, which must be seen to be believed — Atlas Obscura has a nice writeup here: http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-club
I live close to the up-and-coming Letna neighborhood, which is anchored by the Bio Oko arthouse cinema and cafe (https://goo.gl/maps/rLkuMmDs9YF2). That neighborhood has the National Technical Museum, a must-see for geeks (https://goo.gl/maps/a9h6YqqUp6v) and Letna Park’s beer garden (https://goo.gl/maps/Dqvzyh8HNEs), which has one of the best views in town. In between are all kinds of great cafes and bars.
I’d strongly recommend getting a metro pass for the time you’re here. It’s cheap and so much less hassle. I’d also recommend (if you have mobile data) the Google Maps app, which also gives you timetables and nearest transit stops.
Prague taxis are a total ripoff, and I definitely do not recommend taking a taxi from the street. Use one of the services instead. I use Tick Tack Taxi (www.ticktack.cz), Taxi AAA (http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/), and Uber, which works well (although, like everywhere, surge pricing is something to watch for).
If you’re heading toward Vienna, I’d recommend either Český Krumlov or Mikulov. Český Krumlov is one of my favorite places on the planet and an amazing UNESCO World Heritage site — it’s an entire town from the 14th century flawlessly preserved. Just gorgeous. Mikulov, in southern Moravia, is in the wine region, and is also a really nice place to be, moreso in summertime. Plus, there’s a nice waterpark just outside of town (http://www.aqualand-moravia.cz/en)/.
If you’re heading north toward Berlin, I’d recommend taking a day to check out Bad Schandau, a spa town with a kickass thermal bath (http://www.toskanaworld.net/web/en/therme_bad_schandau/home.asp), and the Czech and Saxon Switzerland national park, famous for its sandstone formations, including a couple of natural bridges.

I spent this summer travelling around Europe and nowhere quite captured my attention and gave me that “I never want to leave” feeling as Prague.
From its incredible architecture to its pumping night life, I was lucky enough to have a good friend show me around the city for four days. If you could spare only a weekend or a whole lifetime this fairy tale hot spot would still never fail to entice and surprise.

We had explored many places before going to Prague because of our love to discover new places. Some of the places I list below are the places we had previously explored, and some of them we found by chance. PS: We tried to explore some concept places rather than the most popular places on this trip.
Cafefin is not a breakfast place where you can spend hours as we are used to. For example, you wake up so early, you’re in a hurry, you want to have a healthy and delicious breakfast. Then here is the right address! This busy and popular cafe is the first Vietnamese coffehouse in Prague. There are mini tables and the stools at the long bar that you can sit. The staff are incredibly friendly. The Vietnamese baguette category in the menu attracted our attention. Baguette varieties were not the kind we were used to, but I have to say that I liked it very much! The cafe is also known for its sweet chao rice and homemade yoghurt with black rice.
The weather was very cold in April. Therefore, when we were too cold, we would urgently sit in any café we found by chance. That’s also how we discovered Tricafe. :) Tricafe was such a pleasant place that we have wanted to stay for 2 hours. We felt like we were at home with old-looking wooden tables, armchair seats in our grandmothers’ house and rocking chairs. You could read books from their library or you could take a glance at drawings on the wall as a mini exhibition. By the way their coffee was pretty good.
Trdelnik has started to spread after Easter markets that were established in Czech Republic in 2002 and it has become one of the symbols of Prague. We have gone to Prague during Easter so we had the opportunity to experience it in the Easter markets. Trdelnik is made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick, then grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix. I’ve tried the Nutella version of it. You can find different versions of Trdelnik in various shapes and with different flavors. Especially in the summer, you can find Trdelnik with different kinds of ice cream in Prague.
Restaurant Bella Vista has the best view in the city. Its panoramic view stretches from the Petrin Tower all the way to Prague Castle Hillsides. It streches from the west to the north, it provides spectacular views of greenish copper cupolas, narrow cobblestone streets, bridges connecting both river banks and green gardens from red-roof tops of centuries-old houses. Actually, we had come here to visit the Strahov Monastery. After the visit to the monastery, this amazing view has made our day! We couldn’t leave there without drinking a green lager to the accompaniment of this view.
Kantyna is a restaurant where you can taste great meats in Prague. In the entrance part, you can choose the meats that you would like to eat in the butcher section or if you are in a hurry, you can prefer the meats that are already cooked. We chose to choose our meat from scratch and we started to wait at our table. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages are also available, but we wanted to try local beer with our meats. This was the first place we stopped by after we got off the plane. We were very lucky because this place was so close to the hostel. Since I got back from Prague, I’ve been telling everyone about this place. The meats were absolutely incredibly delicious.
Cafe Slavia was the place where Nazım Hikmet had written some poems in Prague. There is a portrait of Nazım Hikmet which is painted by one of the Czech artists. However, the place also inspired many important literary artists. Kafka also had been going to this cafe while writing his novels.
First of all, if you want to go this place, you have to make a reservation. That’s why we’ve waited too long to sit, but the friendly staff was really helpful. I really like their food presentation. They served a meat with a kind of bread that they called “knedliky” and cranberry marmalade. It was really delicious!
I’m a real John Lennon fan and that’s why I don’t recommend this place. We really wanted to have a drink at John Lennon Pub. However, we could not spend more than 10 minutes. Due to the fact that the waiters didn’t let us have a drink here. They said we could sit here if we ate something. If we only wanted to have a drink, we couldn’t sit even if there were available tables inside. There wasn’t anything there to connect with John Lennon except his photos. I would love to have waiters understand and embrace his spirit.
The Hemingway Bar is the most popular cocktail bar in Prague. This place deserves all highest points because of the friendly waitresses and the wide cocktail menu. The name of the cocktail in the photo is Snow Globe. I used to like to watch the snow globe when i was a kid. I felt the same feelings because of this cocktail. Watching the coconut particles brought me back to my childhood. If you travel to Prague, I’d say that you should go to Hemingway Bar.
Enjoy your trip!

The first time I travelled to the Czech Republic was in the early 1990s. Communism was collapsing and, despite the obvious scars of decades of oppression, there was hope in the air. Modern and democratically leaning, Czechia (yes it’s really called that now) along with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia (or the Visegrad Group) showed promise in bridging the East-West divide. I’ve travelled back many times since, happily noting the transformation of Prague from a city behind the Iron Curtain to a modern, upbeat, western city that has retained cool elements of its communist past.
To me, no neighbourhood displays this better than Žižkov — a grittier, historically working-class quarter infused with hipster cafés, craft brew pubs, and cool retro designers. With its awesome blend of old and new Prague, Žižkov is not to be missed.
FRIDAY4PM Shake off the jet lag with a nice walk in Park Rajská Zahrada and stop by the beer garden for a quick refreshment before heading out to dinner.
6PM Nothing beats jet lag better than Czech comfort food and a well poured beer. Head to Hostinec U Vodoucha, a classic hospoda packed with locals, for an authentic experience. I suggest the Pork Knuckle (189 koruna) and a pint of Mordýř 12° (45 koruna). The richness of the pork combined with the pickled veggies and a good lager to wash it down can’t be beat.
9 PM After dinner walk back to Namesti Jiří z Podebrad to take in nighttime views of the church, Kostel Nejsvětějšího Srdce Páně, and then head underground to BeerGeek. A craft brew house that’s constantly rotating its great selection of draft beers, they also offer small bites including a HUGE selection of chicken wings (monkey wings) that pair perfectly with what’s on tap. The bar’s warm, fun atmosphere draws people in and it can get pretty crowded on a Friday night so if you’d rather climb back into bed, check out their selection of to-go beers.
SATURDAY9AM Rise and shine! Žižkov is home to Vitkov Hill, a national monument to Jan Žižka’s victory over the Crusaders in 1420. It’s also a great place to take a quick run or hike to wake up. If you climb to the top you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of Prague from the base of the massive equestrian statue of Jan Žižka.
11 AM Refreshed, and having taken in the stunning views of Prague head back down to My Coffee Story. A modern, neighbourhood coffee shop that serves great espresso and a nice selection of breakfast foods. Try the soft boiled eggs, Tri vejce ve skle, (135 koruna) or the homemade waffle with fresh fruit and mascarpone (110 koruna) to get your morning started off right.
1PM Žižkov is home to some great up-and-coming local designers. A few of my favorite shops include the über hip, cult, Czech bag brand, Playbag on Borivojova and Botas 66 on Krizkovskeho, which carries a wide range of runners, designed after Communist era Czech sport shoes, Botas or botasky. With new designs ranging from whimsical rainbow to classic brown leather this stop is sure to be a hit no matter what your style.
Let the Communist exploration continue with a visit to Bohemian Retro, a vintage shop specializing in items from pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. Despite the selection being a little more tired than I remember, it is still worth a quick stop. A more modern assortment of women’s wear can be found at SugarBat, which carries a wide variety of retro clothing that they describe as “pin-up, rockabilly and goth styles.” Nearby, on Mánesova, lingerie designer Zuzana Kubickova’s showroom and studio has a stunning selection of women’s intimates along some beautiful outerwear collections.
3PM Czechs love to grab coffee and a sweet afternoon snack. Stop by the newly opened Donut Shop and grab a coffee and brown-butter (56 koruna), or maple-bacon (54 koruna) doughnut to-go. Do as the locals do, and head back to the many benches at the square to enjoy your snack while you take in the sites and do a little people watching.
4PM Freshly refueled, or perhaps in need of another cup of coffee, saunter on over to Jirak Farmer’s Market. Described by Taste of Prague as “one of the best things to do in Prague,” this quaint market has the rare distinction of being on Wednesday to Saturday. The food and decorations change with the season, and the selection of fresh fruits, meats, coffee, wine and hot food items in fabulous. People rave about the crepes from Galetka, and the coffee from Kavovy Klub.
5PM End your shopping experience with a visit to NeverEnough. The local design shop sports an in-house bar, great music and friendly staff. Grab a cocktail or beer while perusing NeverEnough brandwear (my favourite) in addition to a more limited selection of shirts from several European designers.
8PM For upscale food in a relaxed environment, head to Riccardo Lucque’s La Bottega Gastronomica. The airy bistro has perfect window seats overlooking Mahlerovy Sady Park which makes for great people watching while enjoying the fine selection of delicious daily dishes, homemade pasta and divine wines.
SUNDAY10AM A visit to Prague wouldn’t be complete without a classic Czech breakfast of koláč from Antoninovo Pekarstvi. Be sure to try the makovy (poppy seed), and tvaroh (similar to cottage cheese), as well as the seasonal fruit selection. Apricot is always a favourite.
Noon The strange, somewhat ugly TV tower, with freaky climbing babies, built on an old Jewish cemetery defines Žižkov’s (and Prague’s) landscape. To catch a wonderful last bird’s eye view, take the elevator to the observatory (230 koruna) where you can watch films about Prague.
WHERE TO STAYAirBnB has a great selection of apartments for rent that are perfectly located to enjoy the most of Žižkov. Use this link to get a $40 credit!

It’s kind of ridiculous that I’m writing about Prague, my first destination after my month long program on my last leg of the trip in Croatia. But Prague represents a special place for me as it was a place to drown my depressed state with cheap delicious beer after studying the Holocaust intensively for a month.
Prague is a popular destination for not only Europeans but also the floods of Asian tourists who come in huge groups on massive coaches. Why do they all come halfway around the world?
Could it be the Charles Bridge where brilliant performers and caricature artists invade the sides of the bridge? Or is it the famously disappointing Old Astronomical Clock that leaves eager crowds to the tip of their toes every hour only to realize its short act?
The infamous tourist attractions of Prague are deserving of their title as some sights really reward your hard earned tourist dollars. For example, the nightscape of Prague Castle and Charles Bridge is ridiculously beautiful and one to be remembered.
But if you have at least more than a day in Prague, the rest of the city is worth exploring and may even outweigh the attractions listed in your Lonely Plant or Rick Steve’s guide. Even 5 nights here wasn’t enough to get a full taste of Prague, but if you need some ideas, take a look at my suggestions below!
Nábřeží Edvarda Beneše, 118 00 Praha 7, Czechia
I hate to see this place getting busier than it already is with the locals enjoying their beer (32 crowns for half a litre if I’m not mistaken) over sweeping Panorama views. Forget Petrin Park, you want to check out Letna Park for its many beer gardens, musicians/DJs and also friendly vibes.
Head to the red Metronome statue in the centre of the park and on top of the stairs (above the beer gardens) which was built to symbolize the long struggle against communism. Here you will see a familiar skate park for those 90’s kids that remember Tony Hawk’s skateboarding games. On the other side you will see a magnificent panorama of Old and New Prague.
V Pevnosti 159/5b, 128 00 Praha 2, Czechia
This one is a little more well-known with tourists, but it still deserves a spot on my list because it is expansive enough to make you feel like you’re the only one in the park. Relatively close to the Old Town, when the city starts getting hot and bustling with the package tours, escape to Vyšehrad for some peace and beautiful views.
Some of Prague’s oldest buildings are housed here, so for history geeks like myself, it’s such a treat.
Kostelní 1320/42, 170 78 Praha 7, Czechia
If you’re looking for some unconventional but well done museums, avoid the Communism museum — made up of cheap write ups and replicas of everything, and come to the National Technical Museum! Being an Arts student, I try to stay away from anything technical. But the inner boy in me came out when I saw the museums impressive fleet of cars, motorcycles, and planes. The museum itself is quite large and also has some historical context of the importance of these products so to add the technological aspect of experiencing Prague, the technical museum is an awesome alternative to the traditional museums.
Also students get a discount so make sure you bring your ISIC card or school ID with the years on it.
1, 120 00 Praha 2-Vinohrady, Czechia
This one was a bit of a lucky find along the way to Vyšehrad. It’s a quiet park that’s tucked in a nicer neighbourhood of Prague and I highly recommend grabbing some groceries and setting up picnic. If you’re lazier like me and enjoy beer more than bread, bring a bottle(s) and head out to the terrace in front of the classy restaurant in the middle. Here you will see another magnificent panorama of the newer areas of the city.
This one is a bit of a cheat because it’s not really in Prague, but it’s close proximity to the city with loads of sights make it an awesome way to escape the swarm of tourists. While Kutna Hora can be done within half a day, for those that take longer or would appreciate having quaint peace, a night or two wouldn’t hurt either!
Some sights in Kutna Hora include the infamous Sedlec Ossuary or AKA the Bone church (which is extremely short and close to being a tourist trap if it wasn’t for the freaky nature of having so many bones displayed openly), St. Barbara’s Church, and the Jesuit College — which generally opens exhibitions and other galleries.
A quick tip for travellers by train, make sure you purchase the ticket that goes to Kutna Hora Město. The main railway station for Kutna Hora is actually quite a bit ways from the actual town so make sure you remember to transfer into a smaller local train to take you to the Město.
The fact that I am able to remember these places at the top of my head must mean something. I hope you will also enjoy some of the places shared to me by locals, fellow backpackers, and Google. If you enjoyed these travel ideas for Prague and would like to see them for the other cities, let me know with a comment or a like!

Ages ago I promised my wife Anne a trip to Prague, one of the European capitals she had never visited. I finally got round to organising it this year.
This piece is not about our destination, but about our journey. We try to avoid unnecessary flights and last year we bought a Tesla Model 3, so why not make it a road trip? We wanted to document what it is like to travel by Tesla. Other electric vehicles are available but I cannot speak with any authority about what the experience of driving them on a similar trip might be. Moreover, if you are looking for tips about Prague, or other cities, look elsewhere.
Prague is about 1100 km from where we live west of Paris. After consulting the road atlas, the Tesla website and various guides to the Czech Republic we decided on a six-day trip. Two days driving, with a stopover in Heidelberg, two nights in Prague, two in Karlovy Vary, and one in Luxembourg on the way back, (thereby knocking a second unvisited European capital off the list).
Having chosen where we wanted to go, and when, we let Tesla make most of the remaining choices. We picked hotels which had Tesla destination chargers, and where there was a choice went as close to the city centre as possible1. We weren’t trying to do this on a budget (it was a birthday present after all), and once in the hotels we wanted to be able to visit our destinations without getting into the car again.
No visas were required for us, but we did have to get two for the car: the German emissions sticker that allowed us in to Heidelberg city centre, and the Czech motorway vignette.
I usually charge my Model 3 to around 90 per cent, which gives around 430 km of range. The car warns against frequent charging above 90% and the last 10% is slow, but for long trips I push it up to 95 per cent (around 470 km) which I did on this occasion.
As we packed we kept a watchful eye on the developing coronavirus situation. By 29 February France had identified 73 cases of Covid-19. Germany 79. The situation in Northern Italy was causing serious concern, but travel to and from Germany, the Czech Republic and Luxembourg was not subject to controls2.
Sunday 1 March Home to Heidelberg (659 km)
The plan was that this would involve about six hours driving and one hour charging. The on-board route planner suggested charging at the Reims-Champagne services on the A4 for 15 minutes and then again near Metz for 25. But I managed to drive past the chargers in the service area and couldn’t legally turn back so we had to go on to the next exit, turn round, charge on the Paris-bound side, and then complete the circuit by continuing to the next exit towards Paris and turning round again. Wasted time about 40 minutes; wasted distance about 60 kilometres.
Our second charging stop was in Hauconcourt near Metz, and by the time we had had a quick lunch we were charged up and in danger of incurring idle charges3.
Tesla superchargers in France are frequently located in hotel car parks (often Accor brands) near to but not on the autoroute. This means that you don’t have to be on the motorway to have access to them. However some, such as Reims-Champagne are in the motorway service areas, and others — such as Metz are in commercial centres.
We reached Heidelberg in time to have a walk around the Altstadt and up to the castle before it got dark. We put the car on charge in the hotel car park overnight.
Monday 2 March Heidelberg to Prague (513 km)
Wanting to maximize our time in Prague we drove straight there, stopping only to buy our Czech motorway vignette and to recharge at the last supercharger in Germany (Wernberg-Kôblitz). Most of the route was on the A6 through southern Germany, which was consistently busy with trucks, but no serious congestion. Many junctions and bridges had roadworks so speed limits kept oscillating between 80, 100, 120 and 130 kph, and for some stretches, no limit at all. Prudence (the name I have given the car in recognition of her cautious approach to overtaking and driving in general) effortlessly accelerated to 180 kph, but I didn’t test her beyond that, and didn’t keep that up for long.
We crossed the border into the Czech republic without really noticing it, and certainly without having to stop which, for someone who grew up and lived for almost 40 years with an Iron Curtain across Europe, still came as a surprise. The car took us by what seemed a circuitous route round the back of the castle to our hotel, but when we saw the streets that a more direct approach would have involved we understood why.
Tuesday 3 March Prague (0 km)
Our hotel was ideally situated between the Old Town and the Castle. Trams and buses abound, but we were close enough to walk everywhere.
Wednesday 4 March Prague to Karlovy Vary (129 km)
After 48 hours in Prague we made the short journey to Karlovy Vary. The road was busy with trucks, and being upgraded in various stretches, but we had no hold-ups and no hiccups.
This once-grand spa town has an abundance of C19 and early C20 hotels crowded round the river and thermal springs. After checking in to an elegant and imposing hotel — again chosen because of its Tesla destination charger — we had plenty of time to walk around, get our bearings, and find some dinner.
Thursday 5 March: Karlovy Vary (O km)
A beautiful sunny day ideal for a good long walk in the woods and some time in the pool.
Friday 6 March: Karlovy Vary to Luxembourg (783 km)
A 9 o’clock start for a full day of driving, under grey skies and with a lot of rain, sleet and drizzle. As before we followed Tesla’s suggested route, driving through the Fichtel Mountains and the forests of Franconia before stopping three hours out from Karlovy Vary in the small town of Motten. Here, in what seemed like the middle of nowhere, we found a brand-new 16-stall Supercharger at which we were the only customer. We also found the wonderful Gasthof zum Biber where we had an early, and copious, lunch.
Motten was right for our East-West journey, but I suspect most of its users will be from the nearby A7 motorway which takes traffic from Northern Germany to Italy.
We saw at first hand quite how many trees there are this part of Germany, and were encouraged to see how many fields have been covered in part with solar panels.
From Motten we were able to get to Luxembourg, albeit with only about 30 kilometres left in the ‘tank’. The most difficult part of the journey was the last 500 metres to the hotel because of extensive road works around the station. I have to confess to a certain amount of ‘range concern’ if not full-blown ‘range anxiety’ but took comfort in Elon Musk’s assurance that there are 10–20 km of reserve capacity even after the screen reads empty. And if the worst came to the worst I could pull in to any service station/hotel/business with a standard electric plug and hook up to that for a while.
Once again, we had chosen the hotel not only because of its convenient location, but also because it has a destination charger. And for the first time the network let us down, because it is an older charger which does not recognise the Model 3 (at least, it wouldn’t connect with ours). Fortunately there was an adjacent Mennekes charger, which the hotel staff advised us to use.
Day 7: Luxembourg to home (418 km)
The car was fully-charged by the morning, and after a couple of hours walking around the historic centre of Luxembourg, and a detour to leave Luxembourg because of the same road works we had encountered on the way in, we headed straight home. Again one brief charging stop, at the same Reims-Champagne services we used on the way out. We could have made it without charging but we would not have been able to drive at 130 kph.
Afterword
I had considered before setting out whether to subscribe to the Chargemap Pass4, or one of the alternative networks of chargers5, for added peace of mind, but decided against, wanting to test the Tesla network.
The test was passed. During the six days we drove a total of 2373 km consuming 426 KwH of electricity at an average consumption of 180 Wh per kilometer. Much of the trip was on motorways where we maintained a cruising speed of 130 kph, sometimes more. We had lights on for the great majority of the trip, and wipers for much of it too.
We missed one Supercharger because we didn’t follow the instructions closely enough; and one exit because we weren’t paying attention to the navigation system. The busiest supercharger we came across (Metz) had five stands occupied out of eight, at the others there were only one or two other cars, and none at all in Motten. The destination chargers all worked well except the last.
We had one screen restart while driving, which was disconcerting, but lasted only 40 seconds or so.
I make a lot of use of the basic level of Autopilot (Traffic-aware cruise control), primarily so I don’t have to maintain pressure with my right leg. It is particularly useful in dense traffic which is running at low speeds or stopping and starting. I use Autosteer and Navigate on Autopilot more sparingly, and find that they work best in relatively empty roads. The driving habits of other drivers are sometimes more aggressive than Autosteer is comfortable with: for example if I pull out to overtake, and then — as often happens — the car behind me pulls out at more or less the same time, and close behind — the Tesla will abort the manoeuvre, sensing danger. That is safe, but unnecessarily prudent — hence my pet name for the car.
Our Supercharger stops cost about €80 in all for a total of 270 KwH; recharging the battery at home to the level at which we started will have cost about €10. Had we taken our old (diesel) car we would have used about 150 litres, at least €200 worth of fuel.
The remaining electricity was included in our overnight parking. The autoroutes in France cost about €60 in total, and we spent €25 on vignettes. That gives a total non-accommodation cost about €175, although that takes no account of depreciation on the car.
We could have flown to Prague for about the same basic price, but to that we would have had to add airport transfers, and if we wanted to see Karlovy Vary as well, taxi or bus fares.
We drove through four countries, visited two capital cities, two historic towns and a couple of places we’d never heard of before.
As of Friday 13 March the Czech Republic has closed its borders. When the world calms down, we’d consider similar trips to other European cities.
_____________
1. Hotels: Crowne Plaza, Heidelberg; Hoffmeister, Prague; Savoy Westend, Karlovy Vary; Radisson Park, Luxembourg.
2. Anne guessed that by the time we returned there would be 300 cases of Covid-19 in France, I guessed 500. In fact there were 700, and it was becoming clear that that was almost certainly an underestimate. We tried to avoid crowds and — at the time of writing — have experienced no unusual symptoms. Whether we were increasing or reducing our risk, or the risk to others, by travelling we have no idea.

musings from a solo trip around the world

I always thought eastern Europe would be cold and grey and Prague is no exception. But, as I walk past grungy stone walls under a slate sky, I notice the city’s canvas begin to fill with color. Each loud scarf or alleyway stencil builds anticipation toward my colorful destination, The Lennon Wall. However, as I weave through the side streets of this quiet, cobblestoned neighborhood in search of this mural homage to the late Beatle’s front-man, the wall is nowhere to be found! Just before I turn to my map for guidance, I spot a huddle of travelers staring at a simple message written across whitewashed facade in the distance. “Wall Is Over.”
All that remains from this crowdsourced feat of artistic expression were these big block letters. What a buzz kill! But then, as I look closer, I see a streak of fresh paint coloring the outline of an umbrella in the bottom right corner. Maybe this is a more apt portrait of Prague’s beauty. A place with a medieval core spared from world-war destruction, a towering castle beyond the reach of any mere mortal, and a body of citizens freed from communism just 15 years prior still teems with the rumblings of creative individuality. Just hours after the wall was painted over, as is customary practice every four years, the people have already begun to fill the space with life.
Prague is alive. The buildings’ imposing exteriors contain the thumping passion of proud Czechs. I could hear the city’s collective effervescence in the the fraternal “Čau!” as anyone enters or leaves a room or through the cracked window of an underground pub. The beer is cheap, tasty, and omnipresent. More signs for Pilsner Urquell (the local water) fill the streets than stoplights. With early sunsets, bars that never close, and pints that range from $1–1.50 USD, it is no wonder Prague’s happening nightlife is no secret to the world. One simply needs to step outside to hear packs of fashionable young people that make the streets feel like the hallways of the United Nations. To walk the streets is to share a drink with both the buildings and their inhabitants — each additional round bringing you closer to the city’s pulsing soul.
It is hard to decide whether the streets are more beautiful by day or by night. By day, the signature burnt orange roofs that top the baroque buildings give the old town a sense of cohesion, as if to cross the Charles Bridge is to step into a 14th century universe. By night, streaks of light shoot up Gothic facades like shooting stars, creating long shadows that imbue even the most ordinary storefront with a sense of magic. The Vlatava River snakes through the city like a moat for the Castle, while trams carry the lifeblood that courses through the city’s veins. Prague’s hip energy remains inclusive and accessible. Like leaving a dinner party at the house of an incredibly welcoming host, I felt a sense of home that demands a speedy return.

Last weekend I had the pleasure to spend two wonderful days in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. It was my second time there but I was shocked because of the beauty of the city. My first time there has been in winter, therefore it was a completely different atmosphere now with sunshine in the middle of the summer.
I visited Prague with my boyfriend and despite hours of sightseeing and enjoying summer vibes there was one thing that we both realized quite soon when we arrived.
Most of the people seemed completely unhappy and were extremely unfriendly.
As we are both entrepreneurs by heart we are always curious and constantly looking around for new learnings, even during our travels. Also when sitting on the train to Prague we were talking about what exciting things we were probably going to discover and how we could make a business out of those things but what we actually found out was quite different.
I did not do any research on this and probably we, by coincidence, met a couple of the few unfriendly people in Prague but it was significantly obvious, thus I want to share our experiences.
In fact, Viennese people are told to be extremely impolite people. Viennese cafès even have the most impolite waitresses, that’s something…

Travelling through Europe had always been a dream for me — not as part of a typical group tour with strict itineraries, but as a slow, meandering journey where I experience different countries getting a feel for the life in this continent.
This was my third trip… and towards the end of the trip I felt something very unexpected.
It was something that I’d never seen in travel vlogs or read in blogs that walk you through the adventures and experiences of Europe.
I was in Prague — it was my last day of the trip. I was walking over the beautiful bridge that connected old town with the extravagant Prague castle. The atmosphere was very lively, people walking around joyfully with live music being played at every corner. The weather was pleasant too and I was surrounded by the best landscape of river, mountain, and the beautiful Prague castle.
And yet — I wasn’t mind-blown.
I hate to admit it — but it all felt… normal. Not because the city was dull or unimpressive. On the contrary, Prague is one of the most beautiful places I have seen.
It was an amazing vibe, so much so that it made me feel guilty for not being surprised or mind blown by the ambience. An ambience that anyone would die to experience.
I realized this was happening to me because I had seen so many beautiful cities, wonderful architecture, and gorgeous landscapes that my brain had subconsciously normalized it.
My brain had adjusted itself to this new reality, and all the beautiful places had unknowingly become my new normal.
It was like eating your favorite ice cream every day only to find out that it doesn’t excite you anymore.
I learned something new that evening in Prague — even the best things or the best places we see or experience in life cease to excite you or offer surprise spark after a point.
It stops being special.
I had always dreamed of seeing the Swiss Alps, climbing the Florence cathedral dome, watching the sunset from the Prague castle — and all those things were truly amazing — but now that I was on the right side of all those experiences — everything else felt just normal.
In fact, when I look back at all achievements or special moments of my life — they all had eventually subsided and became mundane. When I got my first job, or started living in my dream city, or when I first started dating — all the feelings that excited me beyond imagination at first started to feel ordinary when they became reality.
Perhaps, the moment you accomplish your goals — your brain normalizes it. Sparks begin to fade; you aren’t surprised or mind blown anymore and it feels just routine.
Think for yourself, the life that you are living now, in this exact moment, was a life that your younger self would’ve dreamt of… and yet it feels just another day today.
Having said that — know that just because your brain normalizes something doesn’t mean it isn’t an achievement that you should stop being proud of. It simply means life has used that achievement as a conduit to move upward and you have outgrown yourself.
You now have bigger ambitions and bigger desires that excite you.
So — don’t dismiss your efforts or take your achievements for granted just because it feels normal now.
The younger version of me — the one who dreamt of travelling, doing everything from solo adventures to group outings — would be in awe of everything I’ve experienced today.

Prague is truly remarkable. For me, it will always be the most beautiful city in the world. Even though I have spent the majority of my life in Prague and should know the city inside-out, there is always something astonishing to learn!
Upon my research, I found that there’s much more to this stunning city than most residents will ever realise. Here are 8 things that I didn't know about this gem!
Prague's Jewish Quarter is one of the most popular areas, it includes the cemetery and Europe oldest synagogue. It is said that Adolf Hitler planned to retire in Prague and preserve this area as a museum to an extinguished race, that is why he didn’t destroy it when he had a chance.
Currently, the Jewish Museum in Prague manages this collection of 6 synagogues, historical relics, and a Holocaust memorial.

A personal tour guide of Prague and Czech Republic

Many tourists wonder how Prague could survive the war without any significant damage. Not that much true though, but comparing to other cities in Europe, Prague was one of the lucky ones. In this post I would like to take you for a virtual tour to tell you more about what you can experience on my Memorial Tour. Just in case you are still note decided to book.
Memorial Tour usually starts next to the Municipal House. This is the best place to talk about changes in our history, how we transformed from thousand years old Czech Kingdom to Czechoslovakian Republic and how Nazis took control over the country. The Municipal House was the location of the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence in 1918. It is here, where literally, the freedom was born.
Let’s immerse to the streets of Old Town and talk about how life changed under Nazi rule. Did you know, that in the first days of occupation, Nazis ordered a change-over to a right-hand traffic system, and we had only 9 hours to prepare for it? Many brave people joined protests that culminated in November 1939 when all Czech universities were closed and over 1200 students were sent to Nazi concentration camps. We will see the Charles University, the symbol of democracy and fight for the freedom.
There are so many brave people that put their lives for our country. Many of them were members of the resistance, many others died in the last days of the war when they stood against Nazi occupiers. Streets of Prague were full of barricades from any material they could find — cobblestones, furniture, cars… We will see the traces of this fights, that are still visible — you just have to know where to look. And of course, we will also talk about the Jewish community and their members, who were send to various concentration camps all over Europe. Did you know, that Nazis made a decision to protect all synagogues, just to use them as their museums?
The major part of our Memorial Tour will be about one of the bravest actions that was ever done — Operation Anthropoid. The Butcher of Prague or The Blond Beast are two (of many more) nicknames of Reinhard Heydrich, the new governor of Czech lands. He arrived to Prague in 1941 and immediately started persecutions of Czech political and intellectual personalities. He also gave orders to establish a ghetto and to start with the Jewish transports. He eventually paid for all what he did to Czechs in 1942 when two Czechoslovakian paratroopers from the resistance tried assassinate him. To know how it all happened we will visit the church of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in New Town district.
Are you interested to know more, to see it all? Just join me for Memorial Tour.
P.S. I will try to show you also the Petschek Palace. This building was build shortly before the WW2 for the merchant banker Julius Petschek, with all the modern gadgets such as tube post or paternoster lift. During the Nazi occupation the Palace became the Gestapo headquarters. The horrific tortures and interrogations took place in its basement, and there is a small exhibition about what happened in the rooms nowadays. Petschek Palace is used by the Ministry of Trade and Industry today, therefore the visit is only on request.
Are you interested to know more, to see it all? Just join me for Memorial Tour provided by Prague Journeys.

Our experiences traveling through Prague
Prague is the complete opposite of Berlin. While Berlin is modern and hip, Prague still maintains its old town charms and traditional values. At first glance, Prague appears to be frozen in time thanks to its beautiful old buildings, castles and town squares that have survived the past few world wars.
However, after delving deeper into the city we soon realised that the entire Old Town and Castle Quarter were populated by tourists. Most locals in these areas were people working in the tourism industry and shop retailers. I have mixed feelings about Prague. I may be slightly biased by the fact that we both fell ill for two whole days in Prague, but mostly I think it’s because unlike Berlin, we didn't really get to experience a lot (if any) of the local scenes in Prague.
CONS:
PROS:
Having visited 4 countries already as I write this, Prague stands out as the most distinct and beautiful old city. The Old Town (Stare Mesto)is the centerpiece of Prague, intact with beautiful heritage buildings exudes an air of romance at nightfall when the orange hued street lamps lights up the streets of Old Town. Walking around Old Town Square in the evening felt abit like being in a fairytale.
Also for the opera and theatre fans, the tickets to a show were very reasonable (approx 10–15euros) compared to Vienna. We didn’t manage to catch a show, however reading online it would appear that Prague offers a good and cheaper alternative for classical music plays.
Castle Quarter (Hradcany) is a Unesco heritage site known for Prague Castle located in this area and the surrounding sights which are packed with Czech history. Castle Quarter dominates the skyline of Prague as it is located on a hill on the other side of River Vltava. Aside from the multitude of historical museums, cathedral and castle buildings to visit, Castle Quarter also offers the best vantage point for photography. Get yourself a combi ticket at Prague Castle to get the most out of your visit. Some of the notable mentions were captured in the photos below.
Unfortunately our appetites have shrunk in Prague. As mentioned earlier, we fell sick and were homebound for two whole days out of our week long duration in Prague. That could be the cause of our lack of foodie finds, but generally Prague didn’t impress us much in the food aspect. The foodie scene was not as evolved as its neighbouring cities, so fusion or international cuisines were not as plentiful. Their traditional meals are generally meat and potatoes with not much greens on the plate. I’m all for trying new food and traditional cuisines, but I can now conclude that Prague’s traditional fares are just not for me.

Experience Prague, the beautiful and enchanting old city
Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, has a lot to offer for visitors from culture, architecture, food, and drink. Prague is famous for its fairytale-type castles and is one of Europe’s most prominent tourist destinations. Prague offers beautiful views, gothic architecture, and plenty of things to do for tourists.
If you are planning a Euro trip, you must stop in Prague. Prague is one of the favorite and most beautiful cities in Europe. I have made a list of 6 free things to do in Prague. Let’s take a look …
Old Town Square is voted as the most beautiful square in the world. There are so many things to do, and the architecture is stunning. The highlight of Old Town Square is the famous Astronomical Clock. The old town square is surrounded by historical buildings such as the old town city hall, St Nicholas church, beautiful architecture and colorful history. The old town is a city’s heart and most visited place in Prague.

Disclaimer: This whole article was written under the optics of a budget traveler. If you are a deep-pocketed luxury jet-setter and frequent guest of Ritz, chances are your perceptions are completely different.
In this article, I will list 3 reasons why Prague disappointed me, so you can avoid it.
Prague is one of the most visited cities in Europe. With 8.8 million tourists per year, it receives more visitors than entire countries like Tunisia or Brazil (8.3 and 6.6 million respectively).
The Czech capital is known for its good beer and cheap costs. Especially for young tourists.
While they surely produce some great Pilsen (beer type named after the Czech city of Plzeň), I dispute the idea that Prague is a bargain, based in the 3 points below.
The hype made scammers flourish in the city. Unless you developed some serious budget-traveling skills (you can get some in my last book), you risk being ripped off on a weekend.
The old town of Prague is full of scams that are rare in eastern or central European capitals like Warsaw. Talking about comparisons, in my experience, the cost-benefit of visiting Prague is far worse than other…

Žižkov, Anděl, Budějovická, Hradčanská, Staroměstská, Náměstí Míru, Háje…?
What do these weird Czech names mean and how does the area look like?
Prague is divided into districts, as you may already found out, those districts are divided into smaller parts with a specific name and also specific lifestyle you can experience.
During my Prague´s life I have lived in many various parts of the Prague city. I was also lucky enough to meet with wide range of experiences Prague can offer. After all I have decided to share my point of view and try to do a short, but hopefully an accurate review about those different districts.
Now, let´s come back to our — still for now — unknown Prague´s district called Prague 3 or in Czech Praha 3: if you are already in crazy mood of your Erasmus and want to practice Czech language, you nerd!
The district includes officially most of the cadastral area of Žižkov and parts of Vinohrady, Vysočany and Strašnice.
This district varies a lot as you move from one site to the oppossite one. Around “borders” with other districts, like Prague 2 (Vinohrady), Prague 10 (Strašnice) and Prague 9 (Vysočany) it lives their own life. Žižkov, the main part of P3, is less international than P2 or P1. You will also come across some really old and damaged buildings or even abandoned, but that´s what makes its spirit.
When I was going through this area I felt like in 80´s in Czech republic, life after the revolution.
It´s a calmer area, older Czech people are living here, but don´t worry, you won´t feel like in a retirement home. There are many cafes around and pubs as well. You should check out Café Pavlač, for instance!
Žižkov and P3, in general, offers a wide range of flats for rent. Flats are mainly less expensive, situated in older tall buildings — typicall for Czech republic. As I am mentioning in a Lifestyle paragraph, you will meet older people with their dogs, also some Gypsies, however you can still live in a luxurious flat and rock a world from Vítkov hill or Žižkov´s tower (highest peek in Prague by the way).
Itself is a bit different. I would express it as more Czech not so international part, a bit older, not playing a theatre for tourists. It is also more industrial with older buildings. Its highlight is certainly Vítkov park — if you want to feel a true history as a though guy, go there! At the hill took a place one of the main battles of Hussite wars. If you are still being nerdy, calm down, I have not forgotten, Žižkov is also an area of Franz Kafka — a famous Czech writer! By the way the name Žižkov comes from a name Jan Žižka, who was Czech general and Hussite leader, follower of Jan Hus — simply a though guy with one eye.
As you see above, Žižkov area also offers some architecture craziness as climbing babies at a tower, but also many interesting corners for you to observe in old Prague.

Southeast Asia is so much popular and we can read about those ideal places for nomadic lifestyle in almost every second interview with some digital nomad. It has been many years like that but today more digital nomads are tired of Asia and want to try something else.
Why not?
Location independent lifestyle is not about living in Asia.
I know, South East Asia is perfect. It is so cheap! It is fun! There are beaches! You will escape from stress…
It might be true, but why should I stay there for the rest of my life? Yeah, let's go there, experience that, but why settle there?
Digital nomads can work from anywhere, so they tend to move every month or two months. Their “moving out/in factor” is very deep inside of them.
For those who are from Australia or New Zeland it is obvious that they prefer Indonesia, Malaysia or South East Asia. But what about US citizens? Coming to Europe is not hard for them. They ask for a Shengen visa and can travel within all EU members during the period of 3 months.
Many of them know right now and the word of mouth is getting spread out.
This is just a beginning. Let's dig deeper why you will meet more digital nomads in Prague nowadays than ever before. Prague is indeed becoming one of the most popular hub for digital nomads.
The climate in the Czech Republic is very nice for all three season (spring, summer, autumn). Of course most digital nomads are coming during summer. Winter is not a favourite season while you are in the city. Anyway the location of Prague can guarantee very pleasant weather conditions.
Moreover there are no earthquakes or any other dangerous nature occasions.
Prague's architecture is amazing. Many says that Prague is the heart of Europe and the most beautiful city in the whole Europe. And it is true! If you don't believe me, you should google some images from Prague.
The Czech Republic lies in the middle of Europe, you can decide if it is eastern or western Europe. Don't forget bring this topic when you sit with a beer with some Czech. You will have fun, that's for sure :-)
The infrastructure in Prague is very modern. The transportation is easy and as a english speaking traveller you won't have a bigger problems.
Yeah, we do speak english. It is not our official language, but most young people can speak very good english. You can meet lots of foreigners in Prague as well.
When you are lost, you simply ask for a direction in the nearest shop and will get an answer.
There are many coworking spaces in Prague. You can choose if you prefer bigger space or maybe smaller coworking.
The price is around 10 Euro/1 hour or 130 Euro/month.
I can recommend you Locus Coworking or Impact Hub.
Plenty of events are going on every day in Prague. Either business's topics or topics for self-improvement. The good thing about coworking spaces in Prague is that they are not just for work but they really connect you with other interesting people. The staff do lots of events, so make sure you will check them out.
You can find many cultural events in the city as well.
Prague is a place where to party, that is for sure. Prague is very famous because travellers go party here. Some come to Prague just to party. I am serious!
Well, if you come here, it is definitely recommended to experience that. The buzz is cheap and there are tons of clubs.
Work hard, party hard!

My brother and I decided to establish the headquarters of our tech company in Prague. It was the best decision we’ve ever made.
People who have visited Prague before can confirm that it’s an astonishing city with impressively clean streets, stunning architecture, diverse cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife. But most people are only now starting to realize that Prague is also a hidden gem for tech companies.
To understand why Prague is just starting to flourish, you have to look back more than 100 years and understand a bit of Czech history.
Throughout its history, the Czech Republic has always been a prominent economic player in Europe. In the early 20th century, it was actually an industrial powerhouse and held 10th place in the world industrial production. It was only after World War 2 when the Czech Republic became occupied by the Soviet Union and then ruled by communism, that its economy started to halter.
However, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully ended communism, the Czech Republic reestablished democracy and a market economy. Since then (over the last 30 years) the Czech economy has been growing at an impressive pace and it now proudly produces the most GDP per capita in comparison to all other post-communist countries.
Prague also has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, at just 1.3%.
Looking back at the last 30 years and seeing how much progress the Czech Republic has made leaves me and everybody living in Prague excited about the future.
The Czech Republic boasts a great education system.
I myself spent a few years in the Czech Republic during high school and can confirm it from first-hand experiences. When I was transferring over from my school in the US, I had to spend the whole summer catching up on algebra, physics, and chemistry just so that I could join the same age students and didn’t have to stay a year back.
Getting a university education in the Czech Republic is free, which gives the opportunity for everyone to enroll and lifts the education level across the whole population. The free education system also attracts many foreign students who wouldn’t have been able to afford an education at home.
Czech universities also have very high-quality computer science and mathematics programs, which serves as a solid foundation for future software engineers. The mathematics programs are especially key for those students who later on pursue careers in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
HackerRank, a California-based service that runs tests for software engineers, ranked Czech engineers 2nd in the world in mathematical challenges which reflect their skill in functional programming.
The Czech engineers ranked 9th in the world overall. The US ranked 13th.
If you’re reading this article and you’re sitting in a large US metropolitan area, you’re probably used to long commute times and have just accepted traffic as part of your life, as I did when I was living in the Bay Area. Prague doesn’t have this issue.
Its public transport system is ranked 5th in the world and is used by over two thirds of the city’s population. It has an affordable, yet sophisticated train, metro, tram and bus system, allowing you to comfortably get around the city within minutes.
Prague is located in the heart of Europe and has direct flight connections to all other major European cities such as Paris, London, or Amsterdam. Flight times are all under 2h and usually cost between $50 — $250 round trip.
Prague is gradually becoming a global metropolis and is catching up to cities like Paris and Amsterdam, however, it is still incomparable when it comes to prices and is, therefore, a great place to work and live. You can afford to live a high standard of life with an average Prague salary, especially if you’re working in tech.
I ran a price comparison of San Francisco vs. Prague (my two hometowns) and this is where we’ve landed (1):
It’s also tough to get bored in Prague. It’s an energetic city with endless cool events to attend. If you’re into contemporary art exhibits, prosecco festivals, local food markets, underground techno raves, or just into chilling in the park enjoying the castle view, you’ve got it.
Over recent years, Prague has attracted a lot of foreigners and now has a thriving expat community, which makes up more than 25% of Prague’s workforce. Plenty of Americans and Brits have decided to move here as well and surprisingly in some districts you now hear English on the streets and at cafes more often than Czech.
We’re witnessing the Prague startup scene flourish.
Just over the past few months, we’ve seen Prague startup productboard raise a $45,000,000 Series B round led by Sequoia Capital, Twisto, an emerging fintech startup raise $15,000,000 and Rossum, a startup extracting data from invoices and documents using machine learning, raise $4,500,000.
If you’re just launching your tech startup and are having trouble with hiring the right technical talent, or are shocked by the high prices and burn rate you’ll have in an oversaturated tech hub like Silicon Valley, you might want to consider making Prague your new home.
Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I’ll be happy to give you tips and tricks for Prague. I’ve been here for almost 4 years and moving here was the best decision I’ve made.

By Jacques Poitras
MATT WELCH WAS back in Prague for the Party at the End of the World. It was March 1, 1995, and the newspaper and the life he had created for himself were crumbling in the old cobblestone streets of the Czech capital. Prognosis, the English-language rag he had launched five years earlier with a few friends, had ceased publishing; tonight, a final, drunken bash would send it off into history.
Before heading to the party at Rock Club Bunkr, a bar housed in a former Communist nuclear bomb shelter, Welch, some of the other founders, and a few friends ducked into U Vejvodů, a traditional Czech pub. They reminisced about all the struggles going back to the beginning. Charlie Hornberger, the paper’s last editor-in-chief, described closing down the office. Welch shared anecdotes from the Budapest Business Journal, where he’d taken a job two months earlier. At their feet sat bundles of newspapers: the cover of the final issue of Prognosis showed a Communist-built apartment complex crumbling under the headline “The End.”
That possibility had been looming for months, even years. Prognosis had never made a single koruna in profit. Then again, that had never been the point. “Though it misfired and miscued on more than one occasion,” Welch wrote in a goodbye essay, “Prognosis at its full bloom was one of the most ferociously good newspapers any part of the world has ever seen. There is no satisfaction that can compare to this essential fact, nor any disappointment that can diminish its luster. Prognosis was, for nearly four full years, the exact sum of what the editorial staff imagined a great newspaper should be.”
And now it was over. Along with those defiant superlatives, Welch’s essay dished out an equal helping of self-pity. The other founders of the paper had postponed promising careers to embark on this adventure with him; “I, as a college dropout with little experience at anything, had nothing except an exaggerated sense of self-worth,” he wrote. “I am acutely aware that my life, such as it is right now, exists because of this newspaper and this experience called Prognosis. … Fact is, I now have something akin to a viable life, and the tangible source of that life is now dead.”
Prague was no longer the dreamy, mystical city Welch and his friends had discovered in 1990 as it emerged from the Cold War. The looseness of those post-Velvet Revolution days was fading, and the city was completing its transition from Soviet bloc outpost to Western destination. The Czechs were cashing in, hustlers now outnumbered hipsters, and the market was swallowing those, like Prognosis, who didn’t cut it.
Back home in the United States, Ken Layne, a former Prognosis writer, read Welch’s farewell column. The piece, he told me in 1995, “just shows Welch playing his favourite role: the bumbling can’t-get-my-shit-together-but-I-mean-well loser. … He refuses to take real responsibility for stuff falling apart. Prognosis failed because the founders had no interest or experience in running a successful business—and that’s what a newspaper is: a business. They thought business was bad and success was evil.”
ACROSS THE TABLE at U Vejvodů, Doug Arellanes, a former art director at the paper, pulled out an old letter. In 1990 Welch and two other founders — campus paper colleagues from the University of California at Santa Barbara — wrote to Arellanes from Prague. They shared the excitement of an idea: to launch an English-language newspaper in the Czech capital. “The key to all this I think is tapping as many good people as we can,” Christopher Scheer wrote in that letter, “not running this like a business but like a movement.” He would later explain: “No one starts a business with basically no money. We did. Lacking money, we damn well better have some love and elbow grease to carry us through. We were somewhat fatalistic, also, realizing that any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success.”
Welch had arrived in Eastern Europe that August to write a novel. When the other Americans who made up the future core of Prognosis pulled into Prague at the end of disparate backpacking trips, he was away in pre-war Yugoslavia; his pals discovered he had already established a profile. “He made quite an impression on this town,” Scheer wrote to Arellanes. “Women strewn in his wake, fans rumour-mongering about his eternally imminent return … It’s like Jesus!”
Anyone who met Matt Welch understood why. His long, blond hair, piercing dark eyes and affable demeanour often made him the center of attention. In Prague, he took to playing guitar for passers-by and spare change on the city’s postcard-perfect 700-year-old Charles Bridge. Back home in California, he had worked alongside the other Prognosis founders at the Daily Nexus, the University of California at Santa Barbara student paper, composing its weather forecasts as beat poetry. “He drank enormously, liked to wear dresses to work once a week and otherwise tried to create a mythos about himself,” Scheer would remember.
There was no shortage of talent among the founders of Prognosis, but Welch seemed to be the catalyst. He was “incredibly skilled at assembling myriad people to make his daydreams come to life,” according to Ken Layne. “I once told Matt the reason he’d never finish [writing] a book of fiction is because he’s too goddamn busy living a book of fiction.” If his life was, as he told it, going nowhere until he reached Prague, then the city offered the ideal setting for his apotheosis.
BESIDES THE STUNNING architecture, a rich cultural tradition, and women with beautiful Slavic eyes, Prague had Václav Havel. Czechoslovakia’s president knew about rising from despair to an exalted position. Havel, a playwright, had been jailed as a dissident by the Communists before the Velvet Revolution of November 1989 transformed him into head of state. He remained an idealist who talked of “living in truth” and building a civic society; for young Americans disenchanted with the Republicanism of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Havel added to Prague’s appeal. “My God, this is what politics should be,” John Allison, an early expat arrival, would remember thinking after seeing Havel’s February 1990 speech to the U.S. Congress. “This is my calling.” By the end of the year, Allison found himself working as the “American advisor” to Prague’s mayor.
Havel “did sort of underline the uniqueness of the place and time,” Christopher Scheer remembered. “He sort of encapsulated it. But he wasn’t the whole story, just a symptom, because every Czech we met seemed to have a wild story, to be oddly humble and intellectual at the same time. That’s why Havel could be president—because he represented a powerful strain in Czech culture.”
Welch came to idolize this rumpled philosopher-king who, indirectly, had made Prognosis possible. In his cramped apartment in an industrial section of Prague, a large poster of Havel occupied a place of honour on one wall. Someone had used a cigarette to burn out the eyes on another poster, of Václav Klaus, Czechoslovakia’s Thatcherite finance minister. You can deface anything on the walls, Welch once told a group of guests, except the Havel poster.
Besides Welch and Scheer, the other Americans who gathered at a pub in Prague in November 1990 to hash out the newspaper idea were Ben Sullivan, Laura Pitter, Jenny Ogar, and Lisa Frankenberg. They were all staying with Czech students Welch had befriended. “The next morning, we woke up hungover and had to decide if it was all just a beery fantasy,” Scheer recalled. “We decided tentatively that it wasn’t.”
The next evening, sober, they sat down and figured out how much money they could pool for the launch. Travellers’ cheques, credit card advances and anything they could sell were all put on the table. Everyone anted up except Lisa Frankenberg.
IN WELCH’S PROGNOSIS narrative, Lisa Frankenberg became the villain. Even in those early days, Scheer and others had doubts about Frankenberg, who had worked at the Nexus before leaving to get involved in the UCSB student government. Her unwillingness to put up money made them question her commitment to their Prague newspaper, but Welch, a friend, defended her. “She was not at all like our vibe,” Welch says. “We were pretty hippie and idealistic and journalism-based and easy to get along with. She was considerably more abrasive.” But he argued that “we need different types of personalities here, particularly on the business side, and maybe we can convert those negative characteristics into something we need.”
Today, the first few issues of the monthly Prognosis look amateurish, with unattractive fonts, awkward layout, and collegiate earnestness. But they were fresh and lively, and in the spring of 1991, with Prague’s expatriate population swelling, and thousands of English-speaking tourists on the way, they represented a triumph. The founders, their meager start-up funds supplemented with money from “investors” — a few well-heeled family friends back home — had waded through layers of left-over Communist bureaucracy just to launch the paper. The first edition, “zero issue,” was snapped up by expats and backpackers starved for something to read in English. The paper would go on to chronicle everything from the sweeping privatization of state institutions, to the growth of the drug trade and prostitution, to the establishment of an Andy Warhol Museum in the Slovak village where the artist’s mother was born. “We wanted to create something that had never existed, in a place where it was impossible to imagine such a thing existing,” Welch says.
Frankenberg soon began to have doubts. In charge of distribution and advertising, she heard the same comments over and over when she tried to sell subscriptions and ad space to the growing foreign business community. Prognosis was fun, but her prospective clients wanted serious business news to help them understand this lucrative new market. They also wanted it fast: a monthly paper didn’t provide immediacy in a quickly changing economy. And the sometimes arch, collegiate tone of the paper turned them off.
In an interview in 1995, Frankenberg described how no one at Prognosis seemed concerned about what she was hearing. “The attitude was, ‘We’re having fun, we’re enjoying this, why should we change?’” she told me. There was no business plan for growth, and no budget forecasting revenues and expenses. “Very clearly, the response [from the others] was, ‘We’re not a business, we’re a newspaper.’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute, a newspaper is a business.’”
Frankenberg’s worries were compounded the day Alan Levy visited the Prognosis office to offer his services. Levy, a 59-year-old American journalist, had covered the Prague Spring, Alexander Dubček’s 1968 attempt to democratize Communism from within. When Soviet tanks arrived to crush Dubček’s experiment, Levy was expelled. He lived in Vienna for 21 years, moving back shortly after the Velvet Revolution, and his book about 1968, So Many Heroes, became a must-read for expats. He proposed writing a column for Prognosis, a series of profiles of interesting Czechs and expatriates.
The founders turned him down. “We didn’t want to publish an archetypal expat-freelancer just because he had ‘clips,’” Welch later wrote. “I wasn’t at that fateful meeting, but apparently he came on strong and condescending, and I’m sure we were more than just a little defensive about people questioning our credentials and telling us what we should cover. So with those prejudices, we read his stuff and thought it wouldn’t fit into our Mission-from-God approach.”
Welch came to see it as a defining moment for the young paper: “We finally had confidence enough in what we were to reject an over-qualified representative of what we didn’t want to be,” Welch said. Frankenberg would later call her Prognosis colleagues “callow” for not hiring Levy. “I was flabbergasted that anyone would turn away such a gifted writer and I expressed my apologies to Alan,” she wrote years later. Frankenberg was now so frustrated that she considered packing it in and resuming her studies back in the States in the fall.
But in July 1991, a newspaper distributor working for Frankenberg had a chance meeting with a Texas businessman, Monroe Luther, who was in Prague inking deals. Luther told Frankenberg he might invest in Prognosis, but he wanted his money put to good use: he wanted a more business-oriented weekly, and suggested she come back with him in two days with a proposal to transform the paper.
According to Matt Welch and Christopher Scheer, Frankenberg and her philosophical soulmate in the Prognosis business office, Kent Hawryluk, demanded a radical change of editorial direction—more serious and business-friendly—without mentioning Luther’s possible infusion of cash. (Frankenberg disputed this account when I interviewed her in 1995, saying she was upfront about Luther’s investment offer and that the desire for a revamp came from him.) Frankenberg and Hawryluk also wanted to be equal partners in the business, a status denied to them because they had invested no money. Otherwise, they said, they’d walk. “Man, were we agonized,” Welch says. “We definitely needed them, and they did stuff we couldn’t imagine doing ourselves, but there was something pretty gross and not trustworthy about playing ultimatum games with an idealistic venture started by people of good faith. So ultimately, we said no.”
A few days later, Frankenberg and Hawryluk resigned from Prognosis and persuaded Luther to use his money to help them launch a business-oriented weekly called The Prague Post. It hit the streets in October, 1991, its early issues were hopelessly dull in design, style and content. But the paper knew how to sell itself: the Post played to the business community with credulous coverage of finance and investment, and bought prime space on billboards, branding itself a serious player in the marketplace and selling a lot of advertising. “Their initial billboards cost more than we spent in the first nine months of our entire operation,” Scheer recalled.
Alan Levy was hired as titular editor-in-chief of The Prague Post. “We are living in the Left Bank of the ’90s,” he declared in a column in the inaugural issue, alluding to Hemingway’s Paris. “For some of us, Prague is Second Chance City; for others a new frontier where anything goes, everything goes, and, often enough, nothing works. Yesterday is long gone, today is nebulous, and who knows about tomorrow, but, somewhere within each of us, we all know that we are living in a historic place at a historic time.”
The Prognosis founders were hardly jealous of the Post’s content—they rolled their eyes at Levy’s prose, and they wouldn’t miss Frankenberg and Hawryluk—but the pair took their advertising and distribution contacts with them. Suddenly, Prognosis was without a business staff, and without the network the pair had assembled to sell the newspaper in an often-baffling post-Communist environment. “It was like a jackhammer in the nuts,” Welch says. “It totally drained the joy out of the situation.”
Welch, Scheer, and the others responded by taking Prognosis biweekly and working even harder. “We did not, however, try to beat the Post at their own game,” Scheer said. “Arrogant or not, we decided very consciously to keep trying to put out the newspaper that we wanted to put out and not just try to be a local version of The Wall Street Journal.”
THEY STILL HAD HYPE on their side. For foreign reporters dropping in on Prague to profile the growing expat community, the grimy, cluttered Prognosis office was an essential stop. The paper represented the kind of journalism they secretly wanted to practice: fun, smart, brashly principled. Any feature piece on the self-exiled, twentysomethings of Prague inevitably included the same tropes: the American-owned New York Pizza restaurant; the mayor’s “American advisor,” John Allison, who had moved onto a job in Havel’s office in the majestic Castle overlooking the city; Laundry Kings, the American-owned, first-ever self-serve laundromat in Prague—and Prognosis. “It’s practically impossible to live here for any length of time and not be interviewed by some major paper or broadcast network, adding another level of absurdity to what is already a pretty ridiculous existence,” Welch would write. “All this silliness has not exactly hurt our paper, my career or my swelling ego needs.”
In July 1992 Welch was the central character in a lengthy article in Details magazine that many expats credited with single-handedly spinning the Prague hype-meter into the stratosphere. Using Prognosis as a framing device, writer Henry Copeland portrayed Prague as a hedonistic haven for a new lost generation. Welch and others would mock the article, particularly a quotation uttered by one Prognosis writer: “In Prague, everything is so open that you can re-invent yourself every day.” Yet a copy of that issue, preserved like new, was tucked away in Welch’s flat, where I discovered it during the two months I spent subletting his place.
In retrospect, that Details piece represented the high-water mark for expatriate Prague. The same summer it was published, reality began to intrude on the fairy tale: Czechoslovakia’s first full-scale elections, in June 1992 produced a political schism in the federation. Václav Klaus, leader of the Civic Democratic Party, triumphed in the Czech parliament, while the victory of a pro-independence party in Slovakia threatened to split the country. Klaus, a bottom-line man in favour of rapid privatization and economic restructuring, had no qualms about saying goodbye to the Slovaks: the poorer, slower-to-modernize, more rural part of the federation was a drag on his ideological plans. As president, Václav Havel sought to preserve the federation because of the multi-ethnic ideal it represented, but even Havel’s moral authority could not contain the forces that had been unleashed. On New Year’s Day, 1993, Czechoslovakia, the country that had survived Nazism and Communism, the two great totalitarian plagues of the twentieth century, ceased to exist.
Havel was soon chosen as president of the new Czech Republic and Klaus became its prime minister. Prognosis would call them “those wild and warring poster boys of the modern Czech soul.” Klaus, the no-nonsense, get-things-done manager in a hurry to downsize the machinery of government, was the efficient administrator, while Havel, the philosopher and moralist, was perfect for the role of symbolic head of state. They would clash repeatedly: Havel felt Klaus forgot the human element in governing; Klaus found Havel’s dreamy idealism impractical. “The advocate of non-political politics met a consummate political animal,” Havel’s biographer later wrote.
The schism echoed Prague’s expat newspaper war: Prognosis, though struggling financially, continued to strive for a journalistic ideal akin to Havel’s “living in truth” as it chronicled the changes in Czech society. The Post, Klaus-like in its pragmatism, prospered by playing to the market, giving the big-spending expat business community what it wanted. Prognosis was still cooler, but like Havel, it was no longer invincible.
THE DETAILS STORY drew me to Prague as I fled a recession-wracked newspaper industry in Canada. But by the time I arrived in January 1993, the city was re-inventing itself so quickly that it was no longer the Capital of Dreams sketched by the magazine just six months earlier. The cost of two expat staples, beer and apartment rent, both ridiculously cheap by U.S. standards in early 1992, were creeping up as the market adjusted to the city’s destination status. The talk now was less about Havel, the playwright president, and more about Klaus, the economic guru whose reforms were seen as a textbook example of how to move from Communism to capitalism.
Visiting reporters had also discovered a new source of expat wisdom. They now often visited the offices of The Prague Post to interview Lisa Frankenberg. Across town at Prognosis, meanwhile, the founders, exhausted by the grind of publishing and the battle with the Post, turned over senior editorial positions to newcomers and moved into writing positions, or onto new adventures. Welch relocated to Bratislava, the capital of newly independent Slovakia, to run the paper’s bureau there, while the new managers grappled with how to give the operation some much-needed stability.
The new publisher, Erica Breth, discovered there was still no real budget, business plan, or bookkeeping. (Scheer, when I interviewed him in 1995, disputed the idea that the founders had ignored the business side; they “worried enormously” about it, he said, but “none of it made our business sense any more acute, none of it made us more organized, none of it brought us big investors.”) More money from “investors” back in the U.S., including wealthy liberal philanthropist Helen Bing, couldn’t erase the red ink. The journalism remained solid, and Breth and her fellow managers stayed one step ahead of invoices from printers, phone companies and other suppliers. But Prognosis was sputtering financially.
Several staff members left in the summer and fall of 1993. Some, like me, were lured by jobs back home; most feared the paper’s demise was a matter of time. On a fundraising trip to the United States, Breth made the rounds of foundations and other do-gooders who had endowed the paper in the early days. But the Czech Republic’s much-publicized economic success meant, perversely, that the novelty of a scrappy little paper in Prague was wearing off. The money Breth gathered in early 1994 was quickly used, all at once, to pay off the paper’s printers, who hadn’t collected for months and were refusing to roll the presses.
Matt Welch wouldn’t give in. He left the bureau in Bratislava and returned to Prague, where he and Ben Sullivan, another founder, stepped back into senior editorial jobs under John Allison, who became editor-in-chief. “I still recall that the engine that was the news desk was being fueled almost single-handedly by Matt and John Allison, who both toiled mightily to put out a newspaper,” reporter Logan Mabe would say.
Welch was still making myths: Prognosis could rise again. In May, 1994, a Dutch businessman, Harmen Smink, injected cash by buying 51 per cent of the paper. Welch contacted a handful of Prognosis alumni in California, among them Ken Layne, and appealed to them to return to Prague. “He had these various godlike attributes attached to each of us,” Layne told me in 1995, “and he figured he could just play God and assemble a new group of ‘founders’ that would continue the legacy, as it were, and maybe put some fire and guts back into it.” Others were wary, but Layne accepted an offer to become editor-in-chief—until he learned at the last minute that he would not have the authority Welch had promised him. He was tempted, he said, to fly to Prague “just to beat the shit out of Matt and leave him for dead with his fucking guitar rammed up his hippy ass.” In Layne’s place, Charlie Hornberger, a Nexus pal of Welch, took over.
Smink’s money allowed Prognosis to move into better offices and go weekly with full-colour covers. Newsstand sales jumped, but advertising did not. Within a few weeks the problems began anew: Smink’s hard currency seemed to be evaporating. It would later emerge that the paper’s business manager was defrauding the paper, funneling money into her own private ventures. By the time anyone noticed, it was too late.
The newspaper’s philosophical guru up in Prague Castle was in no better state. As his popularity plummeted, Václav Havel mused to one interviewer about how he looked forward to leaving the presidency and becoming a simple pensioner. The economy, not ethics and morals, drove the agenda in Prague, and Prime Minister Václav Klaus was the man of the moment. He had a budget surplus forecast for 1995, the lowest inflation rate in the former Soviet bloc, and a jobless rate below four per cent. At the end of 1994, Klaus mocked Havel’s idea of the president delivering a “State of the Nation” address to Parliament — then delivered one himself. Poll after poll showed Czechs considered Havel the more principled of the two men, but they trusted Klaus to run the country.
On New Years’ Day, 1995, Klaus gave a look-ahead interview to the country’s first private TV station, Nova. In a clear attempt to eclipse the president, it was broadcast at the same time as Havel’s New Year’s address on state television. Of Havel’s remarks, Prognosis reported: “Far from an optimist in his days of waning popularity and influence, Havel could apparently muster only the dark conclusion that ‘Not everything is lost yet.’”
The president might as well have been talking about the expat newspaper inspired by his idealism. As the financial situation worsened, Welch accepted a job at the Budapest Business Journal. Smink tried to buy out the remaining 49 per cent of the paper still owned by Welch and the founders; when they balked, he cut off salaries and shopped his controlling shares to potential buyers, including The Prague Post. A gossip column in the February 21 issue of Prognosis ended prophetically with a comment that “all things come to an end sometime.” The following week, the founders decided to maintain their paper’s dignity. They closed it down.
MATT WELCH SAT down with a bottle of wine at his desk in Budapest at the end of February 1995 and wrote a piece for the final issue of Prognosis that would be headlined “A Long Goodbye to the Paper I Loved Best.”
“We were right all along,” Welch wrote, “if excessively stupid and self-indulgent in the deployment.” He expressed pride in the legacy Prognosis would leave—in particular the journalism education it gave to many young Czechs and Slovak interpreters and translators who became talented reporters for local media organizations—but he also mourned: this was the piece in which he declared that “the tangible source of [his] life is now dead,” tying his own fate to that of the daydream he would soon bury. “What I was expressing there,” he says now, “was a kind of gratitude for having been able to experience something that made me at least quasi-presentable to the world of journalism, and a melancholy for that beautiful and helpful thing being dead.”
Lisa Frankenberg told me she felt no sense of triumph at the demise of Prognosis, even though it gave her Prague Post a freer hand in Prague’s English-language media market. She claimed to be moved by Welch’s coda. “There were probably only a handful of people who read that through to the end. I read it. I read it to the very end,” she said. Winning the expat newspaper war was “very weird and sad. It was a very weird day. We knew it was coming for a long time.”
One night in May 1995, as the spring air brought with it the promise of another beautiful summer in Prague, Frankenberg took a stroll on the Charles Bridge with Monroe Luther, the owner of the Post. They talked about the paper’s prospects: its circulation was rising, and a growing number of English-speaking Czechs read it. “It’s a successful business,” Frankenberg told me at the time, though she refused to reveal if it was profitable.
Suddenly Frankenberg saw a familiar figure with a guitar, blond hair waving in the breeze as he strummed on the bridge. “Hey, Matt!” she yelled. He smiled, answered, “Hey, Frankenberg.” Matt Welch was back in town, and could still muster a smile for his former rival.
Frankenberg and Luther kept walking. “Someday in the future, I’d like to sit down with him and have a coffee or a beer and talk things out,” she told me in 1995. “But it takes time. It was probably like part of him dying when Prognosis died.”
They never had that coffee. Welch eventually returned to the United States, where, he says, he parlayed what he called the “quasi-presentable” reputation he earned in Prague into a career in journalism. The Prague Post continues to publish digitally, though it shed its print edition in 2013. Welch says he holds no grudge against Frankenberg. “Why? Competition’s good, man! It made both papers better. And because I, unlike her, can look at myself in the mirror every night before going to sleep without so much as a twinge of doubt of how I comported myself professionally in my early twenties. She won the battle, for which she deserves real credit. But history will not remember her paper nearly the same way, and that just makes me smile and smile.”
IN 1995, MANY Prognosis staffers and alumni were less sanguine. True, the city had become faster, harder, more expensive and less forgiving: the free market that had made Prognosis possible had killed it. But it was tempting to conclude Welch and the others had squandered what they had built—a newspaper that everyone who worked there had come to consider their own.
“These American kids start the first English-language newspaper. … It can’t help but thrive, right?” Welch’s friend, Ken Layne, told me in an e-mail in 1995. “It sputters along for several years, getting a million dollars in free press, no business plan, no financial plan, no discipline, just bumbling along, just like all of Prague is doing. And just like the fucking Communists, Prognosis is living off subsidies,” a reference to the money from relatives and foundations in the United States. “Meanwhile, the Czechs figure it all out. They toss away a lifetime of anti-capitalist bullshit and turn Prague into a fucking money machine. Everybody figures out how to run a business, how to make cash, how to succeed — everybody but these American kids who refuse to even acknowledge the need for money, for success.
“If Lisa Frankenberg is your villain,” Layne added, “you’ve bought into the biggest piece of fabricated history ever. If they had figured out how to use Lisa’s smarts … Prognosis would be a thriving media empire today instead of a dead newspaper fondly remembered by fifty people. The results speak for themselves. Lisa is no monster. A hundred other people have felt the same way about the half-ass manner in which Prognosis was run.”
When I remind Layne of those comments almost two decades later, he explains that “one of my habits of my youth was to get good and drunk and pissed off while typing. It was, I guess, my literary style of the era.” In 1995, he says, he was still bitter about his aborted return to Prague. “I was supposed to be editor of a paper I loved in the Czech Republic, and instead I was drifting around.”
Layne still doesn’t blame Frankenberg for the paper’s demise: she left in 1991, and the paper took another four years to fold, he points out, plenty of time to have turned things around. But he is more forgiving of Welch and company. “While I’ve lost touch with all but a dozen or so of the Prognosis gang, those dozen people remain some of my best friends,” he says. “The group of Californians and Czechs who started up that paper did a pretty good job with intolerable circumstances.” Even in 1995, at his most frustrated, Layne said of them, “they are good people, and that Prague experience remains incredibly significant. It reverberates through every part of my life.”
CHRISTOPHER SCHEER’S FATHER, journalist Robert Scheer, urged the Prognosis founders in 1994 “to just become an Internet newspaper,” Welch says, “which would have been way ahead of the curve.” Instead, because the paper died at almost the precise moment the Internet became a mass phenomenon, there is no online archive or digital database of its five-year run. Former employees now speak of a complete set of printed issues the way one recounts an urban legend: the full run is always sitting in the basement of the friend of a friend, just out of reach. So Prognosis, as an iteration of young, earnest, idealistic journalism, cannot be considered in its entirety, but only in pieces. A virtual collection of yellowed issues lies scattered across the globe, a notional scrapbook of clippings, impressions, half-memories and fading photographs.
In the twenty years since its demise, my picture of Prognosis has evolved from a lost opportunity into something else. As a bit player, I too was frustrated to see it fold. Today, I no longer imagine an alternate history in which Prognosis survived the nineties: I just marvel at the audacity of its brief, improbable existence. During one gloomy period in 1993, Christopher Scheer wrote in a memo to the staff that the paper was not “a normal institution. … Stability is not its primary, overriding goal. Those who seem to wish Prognosis was some great gleaming ship of stable corporate love — including myself at many an exhausted moment — would not want to work at such a place.” The founders of Prognosis gave us a life-changing experience; they didn’t owe us permanence.
Any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success, Scheer had said. And so the sharp edges of the picture soften to something else: a moment, ephemeral but real, in the dusty swirl of post-1989 Central Europe. Lyle Zimskind, a managing editor of the Czech edition of Esquire, would remember Prognosis as “chaotically managed” but “livelier” than the Post — a victory by any measure, except that of for-profit survival.
In his 1990 letter, Scheer had advocated “not running this like a business but like a movement.” And every movement runs its course. Welch made not only his daydreams come to life, but those of every other expat who saw their work — their words, their whimsy, their passion — on those pages. “Prognosis was an expression of pure newspaper romanticism,” he says. “The whole thing was an expression of love for the form.”
“The paper failed,” writer Logan Mabe would conclude, “but it wasn’t a failure.”
IN LATE 2011, Welch, now the editor-in-chief of Reason, a Washington libertarian magazine, returned to Prague to attend the funeral of his idol, Václav Havel. Havel’s English translator, Paul Wilson, had secured him a seat inside St. Vitus Cathedral, the imposing Gothic structure at Prague Castle that dominates the city skyline.
Outside the gates, hundreds of thousands normally taciturn Czechs were mourning their hero. They were part of the West now, part of the European Union and of NATO, and though Havel’s popularity had faded before he left the presidency in 2003, his reputation for principle was intact — unlike that of his rival, Klaus, whose government was eventually tainted by corruption scandals. And so, though the end of Communism had produced many complications and disappointments, the citizens of Prague crowded the streets for Havel’s funeral procession, wrapping the city in the same atmosphere of possibility they created in 1989.
In a piece for Reason’s website, Welch reflected on what Havel had inspired, not in Welch himself, but in the Czech capital. “From the Velvet Revolution through at least 1991, and in many (though lesser) respects for years after, Prague was alive with rediscovery and experimentation in the exciting, difficult, anarchic interlude between Communism and its built-out replacement,” he wrote. “More than mere nostalgia for a limited era of time (one I was fortunate enough to participate in), that same spirit of, well, love, or at least its handmaiden decency, has never really gone away.”
The newspaper was never far from Welch’s mind during his quick return to Prague. “That forty-eight hours I spent there was a profound moment, one I absolutely lived up to by drinking until 5 a.m. the night before the funeral with a bunch of ex-Prognosis comrades, and then vomiting inside the castle after the religious ceremony, and also, again, under the Charles Bridge on the walk back,” he told me. “Friends from New York told me to do it right, in their honor, and so I did.”
“Prague is beautiful like an insecure woman,” Prognosis staffer Kate Sullivan once wrote. “It doesn’t seem to realize the crazy extent of its beauty; it doesn’t notice the effect it has on people.” But everyone who ever worked at the paper realized it. They still do.
“To this day,” Welch says, “I reject the term ‘the real world,’ because my feeling is that we should all strive for the surrealism that we were able to enjoy in early-nineties Prague.”

Last summer, when the spring lockdown temporarily lifted, we engaged in a bit of an ‘empty Prague tourism.’ It’s surprising how little I get to see the city’s historical parts — I mostly avoid them because they are full of tourists. Prague is wonderful (so I understand that people want to see it), and the distinctive landmarks like Charles Bridge or Old Town Square are usually packed. And so that’s where we decided to go.
We started our stroll at the beautiful Kampa island. With its maze of tiny streets and an old watermill, it’s one of my favorite places in Prague. We didn’t go as far as the famous Lennon wall, but we enjoyed the poetry booth on the edge of the park instead. This invention is one of the indigenous ideas of Ondrej Kobza, who is also behind the Prague street piano initiative and is always looking for ways to make the city more interesting. Needless to say, I am a fan.
From Kampa, we headed to the Charles Bridge. I was curious about how many people would be there — after all, we were not the only ones on the empty city sightseeing bandwagon. As it turned out, it wasn’t completely devoid of explorers like us, but there were very few people.
The Charles Bridge is usually a bustling hub of activity with its sides lined by various stalls and the space between them filled by a mass of people. You can move only at a slow pace here — together with the crowd. I have never seen it as empty as that day.
We crossed the Charles Bridge and got to the Old Town Square and its famous astronomical clock. When I was a little child, my parents sometimes took me there to see the renowned moving figurines of the twelves apostles, a display that plays out at the end of every hour. But we always had to stand on our tiptoes in the middle of the crowd to see them.
This time was different. We picked the restaurant directly across the astronomical clock, sat at an outside table, ordered lunch, and waited for the whole spectacle to begin.
I have never ever thought that I would be eating in one of the Old Town Square restaurants. Usually, they are full of tourists, and the prices are astronomical — no pun intended. Today though, the restaurant was half-empty and the prices reasonable. And the food was delicious too! I was glad to find out they served a vegetarian burger, and I can definitely recommend it. If you are interested, the name of the restaurant is El Toro Negro.
We slowly ate our lunch, and then the astronomical clock awakened, and everything suddenly set to motion. The twelve apostles moved behind the little windows, a figure of a skeleton that represents death beckoned at us with its little scythe, and the cockerel that symbolizes life ended the spectacle with its crowing. It was pretty nostalgic because I haven’t been here for a long time.
At the end of our excursion, we decided to visit the main Prague library around the corner from Old Town Square. We had a particular reason for it — in the lobby is a sculpture that I love, and Ben has never seen it before. It is a tower built from old books stretching from the floor to the ceiling. Inside of it are two mirrors that reflect the picture, so when you look inside, you see a book tunnel that stretches into eternity.
I never get tired of this sight. Ben was properly amazed. We are a pair of bookworms, so we can never pass on a sight like this. And it was a great conclusion to a well-spent day as tourists in our own city. It was a fun thing to do, and I think we will try to repeat it more often from now on, Covid or not. After all, Prague is a beautiful city, and I should realize more often how lucky I am to live here.

It’s a cold, sunny day in mid-January, and I’m sitting on a frosty barstool outside, sipping the hot mulled wine the Czechs call Svařák.
I can see the colorful Astronomical Clock about thirty feet away, built by Master Mikuláš Kadaň in the early 1400s, with the Church of Our Lady of Týn looming above Old Town Square.
Across the narrow cobblestone street stands the ornate house, dubbed the Minute House, where the influential writer Franz Kafka spent his early childhood.
As always, there is a constant flow of people bustling about, wrapped in parkas and earmuffs, moving into and out of the beautiful square. Many people stop every hour to watch the Twelve Apostles appear at the top of the Astronomical Clock.
It’s busy but not too crowded, yet more proof that the best time to travel is in the winter, when prices are low, tourists scarce and you can appreciate what a place has to offer.
I’ve come to Prague to escape the Covid madness still gripping much of the United States and the West — and the increasingly aggressive propaganda of the corporate media.
My grandchildren needed someone to take them back to London after their annual Christmas visit, and I instantly volunteered.
With my American Express travel points, I could get a ticket almost for free — and prices for a week-long visit in Prague were too good to pass up. My hotel right on the Old Town Square, with its large ornate bedrooms and funky statues of angels with swords, cost me just $83 per night, breakfast included. I couldn’t afford to stay home.
I did have to take not one but five separate Covid tests and demonstrate a near-professional knowledge of computers to clear the bureaucratic hurdles, but I sailed through Czech Immigration with hardly a glance.
After breakfast, I work in the mornings on my laptop and then spend the afternoons exploring the city — Prague Castle and the magnificent St. Vitus Cathedral on the hill, the medieval Charles Street bridge, the Museum of Communism, the shape-shifting steel statue of Kafka’s head by the artist David Černý, the National Museum near Wenceslas Square, the Jewish Quarter.
I pay the obligatory visit to an Absentherie, tasting the once-forbidden Green Fairy, and take a cruise out on the Moldau River.
What strikes me the most is the upbeat, freer atmosphere in Prague.
As much as the US prides itself on its love of liberty, the truth is that there is more freedom now in Eastern Europe than in many countries in the West or in places like Australia.
Some tourists wear face masks but most of the Czechs do not. Life has returned to normal here in Central Europe, and the smiling faces and friendly greetings of dobrý den on the street stand in marked contrast to what you see in locked-down Los Angeles, New York or Chicago.
After nearly a week, I have been asked only once for my digital Covid Passport, and, when the scanner couldn’t read the QR Code from the U.S., the waitress just shrugged her shoulders and let me in anyway.
The thing about the Czech Republic is that its people had more than 40 years’ experience dealing with Communist governments and their insane bureaucratic demands, from 1948 up until the Velvet Revolution threw the dictators out of power in 1989. Once you’ve dealt with Soviet tanks rolling down your streets, as happened in Prague in 1968, Covid insanity is small beer.
The other aspect to Prague that both delights and unsettles me is how safe and clean the city is. The streets are spotless, the centuries-old architecture magnificent and the buildings freshly painted.
There are no homeless visible on the streets at all, although you do occasionally see a beggar kneeling with his forehead touching the ground, hat or cup obsequiously raised upward for a donation. Young women walk the dark alleyways and cobblestone streets late at night, seemingly unafraid.
In contrast, on the car trip to Los Angeles for my flight here, there were entire tent cities tucked underneath the freeway overpasses, mounds of garbage piled ten feet high. Violent crime in American cities is skyrocketing, thanks to the “defund the police” movement and the election of “decriminalize everything” leftist prosecutors.
In other words: Prague shows you that cities don’t have to be cesspools of crime, violence and uncollected garbage. Instead, they can be havens of culture, beauty and neighborliness. The ethnic hatreds and identity politics that are tearing America and countries like the UK apart are absent here.
In the end, this trip is restoring my faith in humanity — and in the possibility, at least, that big cities can be livable again.
If the relatively poor Czech Republic can afford cities of unparalleled beauty and serenity, surely the vastly more affluent United States can do the same.
The lesson I take from Prague, therefore, is that there is hope for the future.
If the Czech people were able to remove authoritarian, surveillance-obsessed bureaucrats from power in a peaceful, nonviolent revolution, so, too, can liberty-loving Americans. Hopefully, it won’t take us 40 years.

Prague is beautiful and it never lets you go. If you are lucky enough to visit it, then likely you will end up doing the same things the majority of the tourists do: sightsee Prague Castle, shop at the Old Town square, take a picture near the John Lennon wall and cross Charles Bridge.
There is nothing wrong with checking all the “touristy attractions”, but there is just so much more to Prague, and I would not like you to miss that. When you take a few steps away from Prague’s most famous spots— a world brimming with lively culture opens up.
I was born in Prague and even if I lived in other cities, Prague will be always my hometown. It is a beautiful and unique city with many things to do and see. I will show you some secret, local-approved things you must do when in Prague. Here they are.
I strongly recommend checking the lesser-known 10th-century castle of Vysehrad. It offers some great views of the river and the city but also features lovely grounds perfect for picnics and gatherings with friends. Some of…

I lived in the greater Seattle area for three years. I’ve lived in Prague for five months. Here’s my take on the wins and losses in both countries.
1Topic: SmokingWinner: Seattle
As a lifelong non-smoker, I define a country’s smoking success as having less of a smoking culture. Compared to the US, Prague has a huge smoking culture. According to data from the Czech National Cancer Control Programme, about 25% of Czechs smoke, compared to approximately 15% of Americans.
Anecdotally, I’ve noticed much more smoking on the sidewalks, in parks, and in the outdoor sections of restaurants in Prague than in the US. Every time I walk through a smoke cloud in Prague, I long for the US.
2Topic: DogsWinner: Prague
If you’re a dog-lover, Prague has two really awesome parts of dog culture that make it better than the US:
3Topic: Dog PoopWinner: Seattle
Czechs don’t pick up dog poop. :( I almost had to stop picking up my dog’s poop in Prague because I physically could not find anywhere to buy poop bags and could not consistently find publicly-provided ones. For months, I lived off the supply I brought from the US, then finally restocked when I was on vacation in Asia.
But don’t take my word for it. A reply on a TripAdvisor forum went as far as to encourage people to not pick up dog poop, as it labeled you as a foreigner. And this poignant excerpt from the Czech Expats page, titled “Poo Fighters” (the Seattlite in me approves of the title), explains the issue even better:
There’s the issue of doggy do-do. However positively disposed you are towards our four-legged friends, no-one enjoys stepping in a steaming pile of poop. Yet despite all those green disposal bins supplied with free brown, erm, doggy bags, some owners persistently fail to clear up after their pets… Matters have become so serious that Prague 7’s district council is considering DNA testing feces at the scene of the crime in order to track down the responsible pooches.
I don’t think I’ve ever stepped in dog poop in the US. In Prague, I’ve stepped in it more than half a dozen times. Get your shit together, Prague. Literally.
4Topic: Public TransportWinner: Prague
If you want reliable, dependable, and affordable public transport, Prague is an easy choice. On a normal weekday, if you miss your metro, the next one is only two minutes away. Two. Minutes. From this list of best global public transportation, Prague ranks within the top 25:
In the US, conversely, public transport is a nightmare of inconsistent times on incomplete routes. I can personally speak to the abhorrent public transportation Pittsburgh offered during my college years; with the minor experience I’ve accumulated, I can also briefly speak to Seattle’s public transport. That said, with the exception of New York, none of them compares with any of the public transport systems I’ve used in Europe. For the curious, Now This News covered the historical reasons why the US is transportationally behind the rest of the world (summary: we chose highways).
5Topic: Health CareWinner: Prague
I caught a lung infection within my first two months in Prague. I went to the doctor but didn’t have my work-supplied insurance card yet. They charged me without insurance for an emergency, unscheduled visit with a nurse practitioner. I approached the checkout desk post-appointment, waiting for the immense sans-insurance bill. As I stood, cringing, watching the lips of the receptionist read out my balance, seemingly in slow motion, it was… $35. Without insurance.
In the US, my boyfriend had some blood tests done in a scheduled appointment and was charged $1,500 post-insurance. Prague obviously wins here.
It’s not just cost, however. It’s also coverage. In the Czech Republic, every citizen is by-default insured. In the US, over 10% of adults do not have health insurance. Health insurance for all is definitely a win.
You go, Czech Republic.
6Topic: Automatic Sliding DoorsWinner: Seattle
Sliding doors in the Czech Republic have two major issues:
In the US, sliding doors open in such a way that you just keep walking, and the doors will move to not impede your pace. Czech doors, in contrast, will open after you’ve been standing in front of them for a few seconds. On my first day in Prague I tried to enter a mall, but the sliding doors weren’t sliding. I figured the mall was still closed. It wasn’t. I just didn’t wait long enough for the sliding doors to engage. I texted my American friend living in Denmark about it. She confirmed that European sliding doors just suck.
I only have anecdotal and social evidence to back up my claims, however, I know I’m not the only one to have noticed this. I don’t know this person, but based on their rant, I can tell we’re soulmates in another life:
2. The doors have different opening widths depending on the season
Czech sliding doors open less in winter. I get it, they save energy. However, this algorithm has a ton of problems. First, you get used to one opening width and then have to acclimate to another. This wouldn’t be a problem, except that you’re usually not paying much attention to the doors when walking through them. Suddenly — SURPRISE. They unexpectedly open narrower than they used to and you walk into the door. I wish I were kidding, but the sliding glass doors at my work cracked in the winter, I presume for this very reason.
And second, the narrow width is a huge bottleneck. Luckily, waiting outside doors in the winter is one of my favorite pastimes. Oh wait, it’s not.
Get with it Prague.
7Topic: Drinking CultureWinner: Prague
US drinking law: No open alcohol on the streets, absolutely no open containers in cars, and .08 BAC to drive. And that .08 BAC is something a drunk person has to self-gauge. Ne dobry (that means “not good” in Czech).
Prague drinking law: Open alcohol containers are mostly legal, open containers in the car are fine as long as the driver doesn’t partake, and drivers must have 0 BAC. There’s no tolerance for drunk driving, or even buzzed driving, in the Czech Republic. 👍
The Prague drinking laws make Czech drinking culture less restrictive for people enjoying responsibly. Additionally, they’re not so strict that they ironically encourage more drinking, like in the US, where paper-bagging alcohol or hiding alcohol in a bottle of Gatorade is a common sight. And finally, the zero-tolerance rule for drivers makes drunk driving less prevalent in Europe.
In the US, alcohol is involved in 23% of traffic-related deaths. In the Czech Republic, that same statistic is 4%. And the Czech Republic is one of the worst offenders in the EU.
8Topic: ShoppingWinner: Seattle
You know what I miss about the US? Target. Need to find some obscure household item? Target has it. Target doesn’t have it? Amazon surely does.
What happens in the Czech Republic? Well, if you want to find that same obscure household item… well, you can go to… fuck it, I don’t know. There are no major shopping centers like Target or Walmart. Think you can turn to Amazon next? Nope, there’s no Amazon in the Czech Republic. Your only options are to use Germany’s Amazon service, or the Czech Republic’s Amazon equivalent, Alza.cz.
I miss you, US shopping. ❤
9Topic: TechnologyWinner: Seattle
One of Prague’s charms is its rustic, classic look. The streets are still cobblestone, the buildings are still original. Apparently, Prague is so beautiful that Hitler himself was inspired to spare it. Consequently, it’s one of the few places in this part of Europe that wasn’t bombed in WWII, so it’s one rarity that preserved its vintage appearance.
Unfortunately, that old-school culture also makes Prague lag the rest of the world in adoption and prevalence of technology. Do you enjoy elevators? Get ready to use some slow, old, questionable elevators that you’re not sure will hold your weight. The one in my apartment building doesn’t even have up or down buttons — just a call button. When my dog chewed up my laptop charging cord, I quickly found out I couldn’t get a replacement in the Czech Republic (luckily, my work had an extra lying around). When I lost my Fitbit charger, I was forced to order one from Amazon Germany.
This carries on to other parts of daily life. When I was apartment hunting, almost nobody accepted emails. You had to call, and calling meant you had to speak Czech. Welp.
Welcome to the shitshow that is the Czech technology scene. Missing you rn, America.
10Topic: Customer ServiceWinner: Seattle
Need help at a store? Czechs don’t give a fuck. Want a shopping cart? Gotta put in a coin to get one. Want a bag for your items? Gotta pay for that too. Need a restroom while shopping? Get ready to pay again.
Generally, Czech store representatives and systems are ruder, less-helpful, and more prohibitive than in the US. It’s even worse if they figure out you’re a foreigner.
Check out this poignant quote and related article with more formalized data on Czech customer service:
In the Czech Republic, a basic lack of understanding of the minimum level of courtesy required when dealing with the public seems all too widespread — and it’s costing companies dearly. A survey by telecommunications firm Genesys estimates that Czech businesses lose 1.08 billion US dollars annually because of substandard customer service.
11Topic: Elderly CommunityWinner: Prague
Perhaps because of the prevalence of public transport and the de-emphasis of cars, elderly people are active and all over Prague. It’s really refreshing to see independent elderly people around the city, a rare sight in the US. If you want to stay active in your senior years, I’d prescribe Prague.
12Topic: BathroomsWinner: Prague
Do you love knowing who’s in the bathroom with you based on the shoes sticking out beneath the stalls? Making eye contact through the stall gap? Do you enjoy people hearing you poop? And hearing other people poop?
Europe has none of these things. Water closets are God’s gift to relieving yourself. They’re little, private, sealed, closed rooms where you can do your business discretely and in peace. Mmmmmm.
The only downside is that Europe has a bad habit of charging for bathrooms. But with bathrooms this delightful, I’ll take it.
Topic: WaterWinner: Seattle
I ask for few things in life. One of them, however, is free, still, ice water without a lemon in it. Seattle gets this. Prague does not. Most Czech restaurants don’t offer free water, and when you ask for water, they offer you the option of still or sparkling. And when your paid-for, over-specified water does arrive, it usually includes a lemon. And no ice. Shame on you Prague.
(I realize that most of this is personal preference. Please indulge my rant)
And there you have it! What I love and don’t love about my two homes, Prague and Seattle. Did you come to the end of this article looking for me to call a winner? I’m sorry to disappoint. Both cities have a special place in my heart.

The art museums in Prague hold some great works of art that you need to see during your trip. Why listen to my recommendations? I am an artist and I’ve been living in the Czech Republic for 10 months now. In this article, I am sharing with you the must-see art museums in Prague.
Read next: 6 Art Museums in Florence: The masterpieces you need to
I am starting with the Lubkowicz Palace because it holds a collection of artifacts that tell the most about Czech history.
The Palace entry ticket comes with an audio-guide that helps you explore Bohemian and European history through the Lobkowicz family and their collections — one of Europe’s oldest and finest private art collections, comprised of items dating back over 2,000 years. The collection highlights include paintings by Bruegel the Elder, Canaletto, and Velázquez and hand-annotated manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven.
P.S: The audio guide is narrated in English by two generations of the Lobkowicz family and the collections’ curators (also available in 10 other languages). The additional Prague InSpires Panorama audiotour introduces visitors to the city’s most iconic landmarks in under 30 minutes from the Lobkowicz Palace balcony.
My favorite museum in Prague is the national gallery (not to be confused with the national museum). With origins dating back to the 18th century, it is one of the oldest, largest, and most respected art museums in Central Europe. What makes this gallery unique is that its collections are spread out in various Baroque palaces, Medieval convents, and castles all around Prague. So, it is not one building but many different building. You can check out the official website for more details on the different buildings, opening hours, and ticket prices.
The National Gallery is particularly well-known for its wide collection of modern artists such as Picasso, Rousseau, Monet, and Cézanne. the National Gallery has an extensive collection of works by great Czech artists.
One of the most recognizable works in the National Gallery’s collection is Vincent van Gogh’s Green Field (1889). This is one of many landscape paintings Van Gogh produced while recovering at a mental asylum in Provence and it shows the painter at the height of his creative powers.
A not-so-popular museum, but if you are an art enthusiast, you definitely know the iconic master of Art Nouveau Alphonse Mucha. However, you may not know that he was actually Czech because he mostly lived in Paris during the Art Nouveau period. Mucha produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, and designs, which became among the best-known images of the period. For that, I think the museum deserves a visit.
At the age of 57, Mucha returned to his homeland and devoted himself to a series of twenty monumental symbolist canvases known as The Slav Epic, depicting the history of the Slavic people. On the 10th anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered The Slav Epic his most important work.
Not really an art museum but the Clementinum is Prague’s second-largest building complex after Prague Castle and houses the most beautiful library in the world. Among the 27,000 old printed works, there are, for example, Kepler’s writings with his handwritten dedication to his friends, the dean, and other professors at the Prague university. The Jesuits founded the Clementinum in 1556 and named it after the former Dominican monastery of St. Clement from 1227, where they settled. In 1775, meteorological data began to be collected here regularly; thus Prague has the longest continuous series of meteorological observations in Europe.
Prague is a gorgeous city that holds a significant number of museums and historical attractions. If I were to pick only one art museum to see in Prague, I’d visit The National Gallery, as it is the richest, widest and most interesting art collection in Prague. However, make sure to, once in yo

GETTING MY HAIRCUT while traveling is something that I still can’t take in my stride. Because of this I now look like one of those Barber: What you want? memes. Here’s my easy step-by-step guide on how not to get a haircut in a foreign country. Haircuts, as they say, are 20:20.
There are two key factors you should aim for when truly trying to devastate your hairdo: laziness and language barriers. Thankfully, I achieved both.Laziness, over time, will allow your hair to look odd. It grows this way and that- always unevenly, of course. Eventually, it will evolve to a look bad enough that if you bump into someone you hadn’t seen in a while they feel obliged to ask “Everything okay man?”
By this stage you start to think ‘You know what? A bad haircut probably wouldn’t be worse than this.’(*Note* If you reach this point, remind yourself: a bad haircut is, in fact, much worse).
This morning, I had that incorrect thought. It was time to get a haircut in Prague.
‘The difference between a good haircut and a bad one is a couple of weeks’ my Granny says. As an Irishman, I would never be seen to disagree with my grandmother. But, come to think about it: A travel blog is the safest place to dispute your 93-year old Granny’s opinion and get away with it.
That’s if I was to do it. Which I would not.
As mentioned, my hair was more than unruly. It was bordering on passers-by questioning my mental health. Too short to be long hair; too long to be considered short. I looked tragic.
I had 2 work meetings on Google Hangouts later that day. Not the phone ones in your PJs. Video ones where you need to appear compos mentis.It seemed as good a day as any to smarten up.
I researched some Prague barbers and found plenty. There was an American Expat website that offered some decent options. Weighing them all up, I decided it would be best to procrastinate.
I took a break from helpful research and watched YouTube videos on ‘How To Cut Your Own Hair’ instead. Almost all of them were imitating a David Beckham haircut of one time or other.
Could I do this myself? I had my own lightweight electric razor…
Could I ask my wife, perhaps? Remembering our hostile afternoon in Cape Cod after how I reacted to her previous attempt, I thought better of it. Back to Google.
It ultimately came down to discovering the barbers closest to Prague’s Old Town Square, where I am staying. I reviewed the reviews and set my sights on their sites. One, in particular, seemed slick.
The website and Facebook page gave a good first impression. It spoke to my need to think that I’m cool and stylish at 31. Even the translation for tutto barbuto- ‘fully bearded’- was pretty badass.
Customers drank scotches and smoked shisha in the online pictures. Smoking Hookah isn’t my thing. But drinking scotch while getting a haircut would be great to tick off the bucket list. It was 10am.
My wife Rachael and I embarked on the 6-min journey by foot from the Old Town Square to Tutto Barbuto.
By Prague standards, it was mild although my toes were beginning to lose sensation.
Flecks of snow fell lazily on the streets, too few and far between to ever last.When we found Tutto Barbutto, it was dark and empty. For a moment, I thought it was closed.
Before turning to leave, I hurled a tentative ‘Dobrý den?’ towards the back of the shop. A small woman, maybe 26, emerged immediately, greeting me in Czech.
-I’m sorry, but do you speak English?-No.
We were off to the perfect start.
We were at an impasse. She had been clear she didn’t speak English. I had zero Czech but 2 impending Google Hangouts. Not to mention, the 99 problems growing out of my head. I decided to push through in English.
-Are you open?
-Yes.
That was good enough for me. I removed my coat and scarf then sat into the barber’s chair.
The lady who was about to cut my hair had dark features and a Marilyn Monroe portrait on her inner arm. I produced my phone to show her the picture I had screen-shotted as inspiration for whoever cut my hair.
This screenshot technique always strikes me as awkward. You can’t show them a photo of somebody who is tooooo attractive or it feels as if your drawing comparisons between yourself and the male model staring back at them dreamily from your phone.
Even the act of providing a photo is something I steer clear from when home in Ireland. Doing anything outside what is seen as standard behavior could be met with the most withering critique an Irish person can give a compatriot:
“He’s getting notions about himself”.
Looking at the screenshot, she zoomed in.
“Very fastidious,” I thought.
She could have been thinking “This man has notions,” in Czech.
To reaffirm we were on the same page, I pointed to the side of my head- albeit, an overgrown one- and said “Very short”. Then I helpfully pointed to the top of my head and said “Long”.
I find myself in these lost in translation moments regularly. While in the midst of them, I hope that a sizable smile will fill the gaps and encourage my opposite number to give me the benefit of the doubt while I point at my head and say random words.
-Zero blade?-No, thanks. A one.
I’m sure I held up one finger and accompanied it with another oversmile.
After a quick wash, the razor purred and hairs began to drop. So long, old friends.
She was painstaking and focused, spending what seemed like 15 minutes on the sides alone. It looked terrific. Suddenly the phone rang and she went to retrieve it.
Rachael came over to the chair for a moment and we both talked about how good I looked before the hairdresser returned.
I’m a long term insomniac and the night before had been rough. I had laid awake from 3.30am-7 before giving up the ghost of sleep and getting up to work out. It was only 10.30 in the morning, but I’d already been awake 7 hours. My eyes were heavy.
And now that the adrenaline was wearing off since my hairdresser was so good, I wasn’t sure I would be able to stay awake in the warm barbershop.Snip.
She chopped about three inches from my hair in one fell swoop. She had clearly experienced my universal gesture of point-at-top-of-head-and-say-long though. Or had she? I waited to see.
Snip.
Snip-snip. Snipsnipsnip.
I looked in stunned silence waiting for her to stop. She didn’t.
While I knew I needed a serious cut, I had expected to leave with much more hair to brave the bitter Prague weather. That protective layer of hair now lay on the floor beneath me.
As I write this now, it seems so stupid. Why not just stop her? There was something that was making me give her the benefit of the doubt, though. I felt like she had a plan.
Turns out she really didn’t.
Rach had been on her phone for the last few hellacious minutes. In the mirror, I saw her look up.
“Keith!”
I ignored her call, trying to look calm as if this was all my plan. The man with the plan.
“KEITH” she called again, louder.
I looked at her in eyebrow-raised resignation. Edwina Scissorhands chopped on, oblivious
Rach jumped out of her seat and walked towards the blizzard of hair.
“You’ve cut it too short!”
The hairdresser paused. After a moment she said:
“Was damaged.”
“It’s fine,” I said to no one in particular in consummate Irishness.
And it was fine. Just about as fine as looking like an idiot can be. The strangest think about my Prague haircut was that, at the end, she shaved back my hairline a half-inch or so.
Image of google screenshot for Prague hairdresser and how it turned out.Can you spot the difference between my Prague haircut and the model?When she finished, it didn’t look so bad. I won’t claim I looked good but it could have been worse. Through a combo or blow-drying and hair-spraying, she made it seem like she hadn’t scalped me.
Stepping away from the scene of the massacre, that big broad smile from earlier was a little more difficult to muster. But muster it I did; long enough to pay the 569 Czech Koruna (about $23).
Then I did what any self-respected Irish person would do.I thanked her and left a tip.

The Czech capital guards its secrets.
We came late to Prague. By the time we made our way to the red-roofed city, the path to the east was already well-beaten by hordes of budget travelers and lairy British stag parties. An influx of foreign tourists has pushed Prague close to the top of the list of Europe’s most visited cities, with all the opportunities and problems that kind of popularity creates for the local residents.
But Prague is every bit as beautiful as it was back when it seemed so exotic, smiling shyly behind the Iron Curtain. The Haussmannian grandeur of the Old Town buildings invites comparison with Paris, but Parisiens would never allow their buildings to be painted like this. Bright yellow next to powder blue beside terracotta. And while tourists gape at the astronomical clock that jerks into life twenty-four times a day, the sun — when it shines — gilds the dark spires of the Church of Our Lady of Tyn and makes the old stones glow as brightly as the painted buildings.
The same force that makes a person wander the world pushes flowers from the ground to salute the distant sun. The artists of Prague don’t stop painting the old buildings just because they can no longer afford to own them. Among the graffiti of the Old Town, two themes recurred: the Golem, as played by Paul Wegener in the 1920 horror film he directed. And the simple phrase, in English: Life Is Beautiful.
Flowers bloom and die and never leave a mark, and for most of us, this beautiful life is the same.
Few of us shape history, like the dead kings in their cold tombs on the high hill where Prague’s castle stands. But that doesn’t keep us from trying. For an additional fee that’s as steep as the stairs, you can climb the tower of St Vitus Cathedral and look out across the river at Prague. And up there, in the teeth of the wind that rises from the Vltava, you can see the old stones scored with the initials of decades of visitors, the merged letters in a dozen languages forming the ridges and valleys of an insensate fingerprint.
Prague isn’t as cheap as it used to be when the first intrepid tourists arrived from the West after the fall of Communism. But it’s still an absolute steal compared to the likes of Paris or London or Barcelona. Two nights at the gorgeous five star Art Nouveau Palace cost 166 euros after tax. Dinner and drinks for two at a Michelin starred restaurant for 200. Prague still represents a great deal for a budget traveler and offers a chance to splash out on high-end experiences at a price you could never hope to pay in other European capitals.
Prague has other marks, too. Scars with gloomier origins than the vandalizing initials of bright and brutish tourists.
On the day we visited, a young woman was lighting a candle in front of the narrow window of the church basement. The stone is still pockmarked with holes, where Nazi bullets once struck sparks from the walls. Seven hundred and fifty soldiers launched attack after attack on the church, but couldn’t dislodge the men hiding inside.
After hours of fighting, the Germans brought in the fire brigade and ordered them to flood the basement. Not one of the Czech freedom fighters was taken alive. The mission cost them their lives and the lives of anyone connected to them. It also prompted Nazi massacres in villages entirely unconnected with the plot. But it was the only successful assassination of a high-ranking Nazi officer. The war would continue, of course, with or without Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler’s ‘man with an iron heart.’ But at the cost of their lives, Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis, Adolf Opalka, Josef Bublik, Jaroslav Svarc, Josef Valcik, and Jan Hruby proved that despite their military prowess, even the highest-ranking officials of the Nazi government could be killed. And 70 years later, Czechs still honor the bravery of men willing to die for their country.
Some fights are worth having. And life is beautiful. So beautiful that sometimes it’s worth losing.
Prague feels like the kind of place with secrets. It’s still relatively new to modern mass tourism, having been shut off behind the Iron Curtain within my lifetime. You can see it in the bullet marks, or in the creepy statue of the Commendatore outside the theater where Mozart’s Don Giovanni premiered. You can see it in the frowning face of the ubiquitous Golem.
Stories make cities what they are, just as they do for people. We become the sum of what we experience, our cathedrals and our bullet holes. Our spires and basements. We may be the wealthiest and most fortunate group of people in human history, and yet so many of us are afraid. Afraid to lose what we have. Afraid to fail. Afraid of others who are themselves prisoners of fear, that makes them lash out and bite anyone they can reach. Fear lives at the heart of our culture, the magic word written down and stuffed into the hollow clay skull of the Golem to make it live.
Tyranny comes in many forms, and fear has always been one of its favorite weapons. Prisons without bars are the hardest to escape. I’m living proof that you can spend your whole life making what seems like the right decision and never get any closer to what you really want — the raw experience of being alive. Inside each of us, an iron-hearted voice commands caution, and while we hoard worthless tokens and live in fear of losing, we miss the bright imperfect world sailing by.
And yet we all want to make our mark. That brief blaze of light across an immensity of darkness, to say in some way to the uncaring universe that we were here. This is mine, a few words held out into the world like writing on water, vanishing even in the act of creation. The rough wind whirls the ticket from my hand, and I carry on without it, lighter for the loss.

Prague is a European city I’ve always wanted to visit.
Since I was a child, I marveled at images of its cobblestone streets and remarkable buildings. So, when I got a chance to visit Prague for 24 hours, I was determined to make the most of the opportunity.
Here’s how I spent 24 hours in Prague:
My boyfriend and I woke up bright and early, buzzing with excitement for the day ahead. As we left our hotel room and wandered the cobblestone streets, we found the city quite empty before 8 am.
We heard a rumor that many people sleep in after a fun night out of drinking. After all, beer is often cheaper than bottled water, and Czechs consume more beer per capita than any other country in the world.
We were relieved to have a quieter beginning to the day. Yesterday, when we’d wheeled our suitcases from the bus stop to our hotel, we realized that many crosswalks in Prague did not have pedestrian signals. Most of the time…

When you visit Prague, the list of landmarks to see is quite obvious — The Prague Castle, Old Town, Charles Bridge with its famous statues. But between them you may find some strange… things, let’s say. In such a case, it’s very possible you’ve just come across the work of Czech artist, David Černý. And as strange as they are, all of them are worth seeing.
Here’s the shortlist of his work list — for more, visit davidcerny.cz
One of the most characteristic sculptures of Černý is St. Wenceslas riding a dead horse, hanging in the passage of Lucerna Palace.
If you have already walked on the nearby Wenceslas Square, you might think this looks somehow familiar. Indeed, this sculpture was inspired by the famous Statue of Saint Wenceslas. It’s even the same in size. But the horse is dead, and upside down. Don’t ask. Allegedly, it represents the idea of thinking that everything is fine, even if it’s not.
Nevertheless, move to the nearby Quadrio Shopping Centre — to its back entrance, to be precise. You won’t miss the enormous, steel sculpture of Franz Kafka, the famous Austrian-Czech writer. His head, to be precise.
It’s 10 meters tall and made of 42 rotating stainless steel panels. It doesn’t really belong to the Old Town, which is probably the best reason for placing it right there (it stands on the private ground). The Czech sense of humor.
Speaking of heads, one of the most recent works is the monument of Trifot, 12-meter tall sculpture inspired by Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham. To reach it, you should take Metro Line B and get out at Nove Butovice station.
The eyes of the Trifot are actually camera lenses, which are able to take the photos of passers-by. And those photos can be shown on the nearby screens (unfortunately, this was out of order in 2023, when I visited Prague — don’t know if it works now). Quite a nod to the omnipresent user tracking.
But Černý’s work is not limited to sculptures only. You can see the part of him in everyday objects. Like the counter top in Mlynska Cafe (Kavárna Mlýnská) in Kampa Park.
Partly a pub, partly a cafe, Mlynska serves as a cozy place for a drink, located in an old mill. If you sit at the bar, you’ll notice a unique counter top created by Černý. It’s actually a mix of rubbish found in Vltava, and random stuff left by the visitors — all immersed in an artificial resin. In a certain sense, it’s a picture of local life, stuck forever like archaeological treasures on a museum exhibition.
Speaking of museums, if you want to explore the world of David Černý’s mind, you should visit Musoleum, where you’ll find many of his other works, including Entropa, his variation on European Union countries.
Oddly enough, even though the work was unveiled in 2009, United Kingdom is not represented (in other words, represented as a missing piece) in the sculpture. It was then a symbol of British isolation from Europe, and only predicted Brexit 7 yeards later.

Prague
I had not heard a single negative thing about Prague before arriving — most of the travelers I had encountered prior had preached about how amazing of a city it is. This had my expectations sky-high for the Czech city, which I hereby declare the Interstellar Mistake (Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Hans Zimmer, reality-based space sci-fi… how could it have not been the best film of all time?!) When I only get to visit a place for a few days, my entire perception of it is largely dependent on the weather while I’m there (Ireland is beautifully sunny and warm, in case you were unaware). Unfortunately for me, my visit to Prague was accompanied by clouds, rain, and cold weather.
That said, it still is architecturally a magnificent place, thanks partially to it not being blown up by war. After all the historically significant, gigantic, celebrated churches I’ve seen over the past three months, the Gothic churches of Prague are far and away my favorite. The charred-looking stone and ridiculously intricate gold and black ornamentation stand out prominently above the other buildings of the city. The largest of these, St. Vitus Cathedral, sits in the middle of the Prague castle on the top of a hill overlooking the Vltava river. The castle itself is a pretty well protected peek into the past, with the palace, churches, shops, and residencies that once inhabited the space within the castle walls.
Another thing Prague does do well is public / street art. This is also most definitely in response to Soviet rule of the city. One particular space called the “Lennon Wall” celebrates the freedom to write anything on a public wall without an authority covering it up. Every day, hundreds of people come by and paint their own drawings and words on the wall, which is now feet thicker due to so many coats of paint. Beyond this street art, there are many humorous statues with implied political meaning, such as giant bronze babies with barcodes instead of faces, and two men urinating in a pool shaped as the Czech Republic. I don’t exactly remember the point of that one, but it’s funny nonetheless. Hopefully one day I’ll be able to return to Prague under clearer weather and lower expectations, and be able to thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the place.

August 28, 2012.
I had just finished my dietetic internship in NYC at the hospital formerly known as Beth Israel Medical Center, now transitioned to Mount Sinai, and I felt a sense of freedom. Where better to reap the benefits of this long-lost feeling than wander around Eastern Europe, specifically Bohemia, specifically Prague?
I hopped on an ICE fast train from Leipzig, Germany to Prague. Back then I had no smartphone, and I used a paper map to guide my way through the winding European streets. I got around just fine, except for that one time I was lost in the rain at 2 am. I did eventually find my way back to the Hotel Sunflower.
One thing I pack with me while traveling is a notebook and pen to write down thoughts, ideas, things I would like to do and see; places to eat and drink. My weekend in Bohemia included a typical tourist visit to Prague Castle and the Staropramen Brewery, yet it also included some not-for-tourist places such as Tynska Bar & Books, and this other place I had read about that was known for its vegetarian food in the land of pork knuckle and dumplings. The Czech name of the restaurant is Lehka Hlava, which translates to Clear Head.
Perfect, I thought. The name called to me after my long-lost night. I needed to clear my head.
After I arrived and was taken to my table at the restaurant I noticed a table of four women near my table of one. They were laughing, and enjoying their food and wine. Seeing them made me miss my friends back home. I bounced back into the present and ordered a full meal complete with a starter, a main, and a dessert with one glass of wine.
Looking back all these years later I cannot remember exactly what I ordered, but I do remember that the meal I had that evening in Prague was the best meal I had while traveling Bohemia. I remember the bill was equivalent to about 12 US dollars, which has been embedded into my memory since I was a graduate student at NYU at the time— not rich in money, but rich in books.
Although I cannot recall exactly what I chose on the menu nor did I take any photos of it, I do know that my solo dining experience was welcomed, and the food was honestly delicious.
Now many years later I glance at the menu on my computer. It includes items such as pumpkin and ginger soup with orange juice, vegetable consommé with yeast dumplings, spaghetti with tempeh bacon and sauce of baked garlic, gértaix — cheese balls with cumin sticks, wasabi dressing, and balsamic reduction, Kimchi-potato pancake — traditional Czech potato pancake with kimchi and spring onion, and hot raspberry crumble with mascarpone-ricotta cream.
The menu reflects the diversity of the chefs at Lehka Hlava, and each dish has a goal to both electrify and soothe the senses. I still think about this restaurant now and then. It pops into my mind as “those carefree days.” It was such a relaxing atmosphere and left me with a sense of, well, clarity. I left Prague happy and with lucidity. I did not get lost that night with my paper map.

Most people know Prague for its cheap beer and beautiful bridges, but did you know that the city has a blossoming art gallery scene, too?
Prague truly has something for everyone. Are you a fan of historical art? What about contemporary art? The city has it all — if you know where to look. But even if you don’t, don’t worry. That’s what this guide is for, after all!
Here’s a list of some of the best must-see galleries in Prague you can’t miss.
Fun fact: Prague’s National Gallery is one of the largest art museums in Central Europe. It has several buildings across the city. Honestly, if you want to see all of it, you might want to extend your trip by a couple of days! That’s how much art there is for you to admire.
Whether you’re interested in the old masters, Czech modernism, or international contemporary exhibitions, this gallery needs to be on your travel itinerary.
It’s a must-see for anyone who’s looking for a deep dive into Czech and European art.
I’ll admit — this one is a personal favorite of mine. There’s no better way to spend the afternoon in Prague than visiting DOX and seeing whatever exhibition they currently have on. They never miss!
DOX Centre for Contemporary Art is Prague’s leading modern art space. Here, you can expect thought-provoking exhibitions, modern architecture, and a permanent rooftop airship installation with some cozy beanbags inside.
It’s located in the Holešovice district, which is full of artistic cafés, beautiful plant stores, and small independent shops that you can get lost in. Perfect for an artsy day out!
This Prague art gallery is a must-see for contemporary art lovers.
Kampa Museum is all about modern European art. They especially spotlight Czech and Central European artists. Here, you can see the works of František Kupka and Otto Gutfreund, as well as other rotating exhibits.
This beautiful gallery also has an exciting location — you can find it on Kampa Island by the Vltava River. That’s right — it’s on an actual island. In the middle of mainland Europe!
If you’re looking for a unique setting with stunning views, this is the one for you.
MeetFactory is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. This contemporary gallery and artist residency was founded by David Černý, a famous Czech artist who also designed the famous Rotating Head of Franz Kafka.
MeetFactory is all about avant-garde exhibitions, live performances, and experimental installations. It’s perfect for edgier travelers who want to see something different.
If you’re interested in experiencing Prague’s alternative art scene, you really shouldn’t miss this one!
Schwarzenberg Palace is technically part of the National Gallery, but it definitely deserves its own spot on this list. It’s a beautiful place, which makes sense. After all, it’s actually a Baroque palace that was only later turned into an art gallery. Its highlights include Czech Baroque and Renaissance paintings and sculptures.
For its historical setting showcasing classic masterpieces, of course. Also, it’s near Prague Castle, another popular tourist destination — why not do a little 2-in-1?
Leica Art Gallery in Prague is a must-visit spot for photography lovers. It specializes in fine art photography by both Czech and international photographers. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, add this one to your itinerary. And don’t forget to check out the Leica camera store, too!
This one is a must for photography enthusiasts.
Last but not least, we have the Rudolfinum Gallery, which is a historic concert hall with a contemporary art gallery. It’s located by the Vltava River, near the Old Town, meaning that just walking there will take your breath away.
The Rudolfinum Gallery offers exhibitions of modern and contemporary art, despite how old and majestic it may look from the outside.
This gallery combines fine art with one of Prague’s most beautiful buildings. It also has a fun name. The Rudolfinum. Try not to think about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer while putting that name into Google Maps. I dare you.
The Rudolfinum is a gorgeous building, but it’s not the only one. Prague is a beautiful city with many views worth taking in. This is why river cruises are so popular here. If you want to see more of the city but don’t have a ton of time to walk everywhere, a cruise is the perfect solution.
You can try this Panoramic Vltava River Cruise by Get Your Guide, which will take you around Prague’s most famous landmarks, including Kampa Island, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and more.
Disclaimer: The above link is an affiliate link. If you choose to go on the cruise, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. No pressure, though!
In case it wasn’t obvious, Prague’s art scene is super diverse. Whether you’re a modern art enthusiast or a lover of the classics, you won’t be disappointed by checking out these gorgeous galleries. So, don’t forget to add them to your travel plans.
Which of these Prague art galleries will you visit first? Let me know in the comments!

“I don’t have a girlfriend, but I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that.”
-Mitch
I decided on Prague next because Kevin had told me you can get wasted there for 5 bucks. That was enough for me. Kevin always knows the right move. Except for the time he jumped into the Chicago River, drunk as hell, to rescue a shoe. That was dumb. The Czech Republic had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
The only issue with Prague was the overnight, 14-hour train ride I needed to take to get there. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to go. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost the equivalent of 4 Euros/night (about $6 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be 3 hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is some deceptive bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand am/pm clocks?
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were torched. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was just me and a few other people who also couldn’t tell time.

April 4, 2006
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple mini baguettes and a bunch of bananas to supplement. I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, lying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling and nodding. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
I put my index finger up, the international sign for “wait a minute,” and went to the bar car to grab four cups. I took some Adderall too, knowing that it was no longer going to be a Tylenol PM type of night. Drugs allow you to execute hairpin turns like an F1 driver.
Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they stood and received their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all good and drunk, telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; four guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dad thoughts.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train and ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like city; the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of walking and smoking, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel.” They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was. Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. I wanted to thank them to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me in what I assumed was Czech for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics. Only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad. When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Nevercomment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in the middle of the night. It’s best to just listen.

When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. It looked like the Catacombs, minus the bones. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon because it was my grandfather’s name, and because I’ve never known a sane Simon. When I was a kid, I went to camp with a Simon who got expelled for torturing animals. And then there was the Simon I knew in Iowa whose party trick was chewing glass and swallowing it. Tons of deviant Simons are roaming the earth unchecked, and it worries me.
Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday.” (The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX). She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was more of a single-cheek, shy smirk, than an all-out smile. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows, and was dressed casually, in blue jeans and a V-neck sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I can usually spot a fellow speed freak, so I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a stumble until the bars opened so he could extend his bender another day.

April 5, 2006
When I came down to the common area the next morning, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. Again, I’m looking at you, London. I was impressed the way she carried herself in the kitchen, and by her motherly sensibilities. She took on the role of “hostel mom” naturally, making sure everyone had a homemade meal before embarking on the day. That really attracted me. (Freud would have another field day with me liking mom-types).
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. It’s so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class Americans wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happen in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were dating.
*
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: We are, Johnny… I’m the umpire so I have final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick.
“Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular in its’ simplicity. It reminded me of a hotel conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer.
When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We pulled up seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked the beers over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on out we were old friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid onto the table. I knew moonshine when I saw it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could see straight. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others cackled. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech music and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling. Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching like Dave used to. Every time we got close, he’d scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: (sarcastically) Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar, where we drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: Running from my feelings? Trying to become my own man? I’m not totally sure anymore. Since my dad died last year, I just can’t stop speeding, that’s all I know.
Caroline: I understand.
Me: Do you?
Caroline: My younger brother died in a car crash last year.
Me: So, you’re doing the same thing?
Caroline: Yeah. I keep telling myself that running away from something means you’re running towards something else, but lately it hasn’t been working. So, I came here to forget myself altogether.
Me: How’s that working?
Caroline: It’s not really. Grief is just a cunt.
Me: Same and same.
Caroline: How about we run together and if that makes it any better?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I hear Bratislava is nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t watch it between now and tomorrow.

Prague seemed like the wisest choice for my next destination, given they were still on the Koruna (information I acquired from the ladies in Paris). They had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
I didn’t know much about Prague, other than that my friend, Kevin, told me I needed to go because “you can get wasted there for 5 bucks.” That was enough for me. Kevin always knows what he’s talking about. The only problem was the overnight, 14-hour train ride. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access.

There’s nothing like Adderall when you need to kill 14 hours. Shit, you could stare at a clock for the entire time and still enjoy it. At least that’s how the drug made me feel.

He was angry about something, probably politics (only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad). When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Never comment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in a foreign country at two in the morning. It’s best to just listen and agree, then form your opinions later.
When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon. It was my grandfather’s name, and he was a miserable, racist old bastard. One time he told me he didn’t want my Indian friend, Naveen, over at the house because he, “wreaked of curry.” I used to pray for him to die. And when he did, I helped myself to his collection of Member’s Only jackets.
Irish Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: “How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.”
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday”. The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX.
She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was beautiful, but she didn’t flash it often. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. I can always spot a fellow speed freak. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a walk until the bars opened. For better or worse, I was now a part of a crew.
I slept like a drunken baby until noon the next day. When I came down to the common area, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. I was impressed, even turned on. She was motherly as well, a quality that inherently attracts me. I appreciated the way she made sure everyone was fed, before eating herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Hostel mom. All hostels had one, but like in life, many of them stink.
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. Its so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class American people wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had the whole two floor almost all to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happens in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were on a date.
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: Johnny… The umpire has the final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way there. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick. “Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular. Some might not have liked it, but I sure did. It reminded me of a Day’s Inn conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar, that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer. When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We up pulled seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked them over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on we were all best friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid, onto the table. I know moonshine when I see it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could stand. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others laughed. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech radio music, and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling.
Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that, and we stumbled home.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching. Every time we got close, he would scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar. We drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day, at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So, why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: I’m running.
Caroline: From what?
Me: Myself. Since my dad died, I feel like I can’t stop. If I do, I’ll have time to think. And I don’t want to think.
Caroline. I understand.
Me: Why are you here?
Caroline: Same reason, really. My younger brother died last year. When I’m home in Perth, I can’t get him out of my mind. He died in a car accident, along with our dogs.
Me: That’s terrible.
Caroline: How about we run together?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I heard Bratislava was nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t. Tomorrow we can take a bus. It’s a short ride.
By the time I got up the next morning, Simon had already weaseled his way into our plans. During breakfast, Caroline gave me a look as if to apologize. I couldn’t be upset though; Simon was a persistent one, I would have given in too.
Simon: Let me get some more of that speed. That was good shit.
Me: Goddamn you, Simon.
I gave him the 10mg pill, which he took immediately, in front of everyone.
Simon: Hey Johnny, we’re going to get pissed today, aren’t we?
Me: You just watch yourself, Ok? And please, don’t open any more beers with your mouth. It makes me sick.
It was only a 2-hour ride from Prague to Bratislava, but that didn’t deter Simon from bringing along a whole case of beer. He bought it though, and carried it, so I didn’t complain. Plus, it was nice to get some reciprocation after getting him high with my good Amsterdam weed for the past two days. The beer was the only luggage he took. I didn’t ask if he had more clothes, or any belongings at all, but I was curious. Best not to ask questions you don’t want the answers to.
He was 2 beers deep before we even boarded. With each one, he’d covertly pop the cap off then put it back on, before pretending to open it with his teeth, giving me a childish look in the process. At that point I’d stopped caring, but he wouldn’t let it go. He was an instigator that way. I’ve never understood why some people show affection by teasing. You can only pull off teasing if you’re funny and have tact. Otherwise, you just sound like an annoying asshole. Timing is everything.
Caroline and I sat next to each other, while Simon sat behind us. He smelled like he hadn’t showered in a week, and he probably hadn’t. When the metal chains on his leather jacket clanged against the poor old woman sitting beside him, she clutched her bag and turned towards the window. I felt terrible for her, having to sit next to a drunken stink bomb like that for 2 hours. He was disgusting.
Speaking of disgusting… I was always embarrassed when my dad and I went out in public together. He was impossible not to stare at because of how fat and unkempt he was. And I was his son, so I got stares too. Food is the worst drug in that way. Most addictions aren’t noticeable to the naked eye, but with food, there’s no way to hide it, unless you purge. My mom always told me that everyone is too caught up in their own lives to notice other people’s insecurities, but I never believed her. I knew they were looking, wondering how a child like me could come from a man like that. I could feel their indictments of him as a father; I could feel their pity. I felt it all. Those feelings have never left me, even long after his death. I can still feel those eyeballs on me.
It was a peaceful first hour. Caroline and I read from our books while knocking knees. The unspoken intimacy was lovely. She was on her second read of a Virginia Woolf book I can’t remember the name of, just like I was on my second read of my Hunter Thompson book. We both sipped our beers and enjoyed the nice cross breeze wisping through the bus. The sun was out, and we were in just the right place at just the right time.
With only about 15 minutes left in the ride, I reached back to grab another beer from the box on Simon’s lap. That’s when I saw the flashing lights behind us. It was a police van, and it was rapidly approaching. When it got closer it became clear that we were the ones being pulled over.
Me: Uh, what the fuck is going on?”
Simon: It’s usually just standard shite. Don’t worry.
Me: Usually?!
Several police officers boarded the bus, all of whom were holding automatic rifles and looking very serious. I swear, in Europe everyone with even a modicum of authority gets a machine gun. They went around checking passports. When they got to me, I was terrified. My bag and pockets were filled with weed, hash, and a bunch of loose Adderall pills. Also, I was American. Being an American in Europe is almost as bad as being black in America. Boy, being black in Europe must be double awful.
I handed the cop my passport, and instead of handing it back, he put it in his pocket and escorted me off the bus. I was the only one singled out. Everyone else just sat comfortably, drinking their beers. The jig was finally up, and my worst nightmare was coming true. “If this is what happens in the movie Hostel, I’m going to kill Caroline for not warning me,” I thought to myself.
He asked me a bunch of questions that I obviously didn’t understand, while repeatedly checking my passport and shaking his head from side to side. It was like I was being questioned by a squirrel. I had no clue what he wanted from me or how I could appease him. I tried to look like an upstanding gentleman by buttoning up my cardigan and straightening my posture, but it didn’t seem to be working. He saw right through me.
I could see Simon in the window of the bus. He was giving me the international sign for throat-slashing. I wasn’t sure if he was implying that I should kill myself to avoid Slovakian prison, or if he was telling me I should find a way to slit the officer’s throat and escape. Probably the latter, knowing him. Caroline too had come to the window. I could see the concern on her face. If she was scared, I knew I was in trouble.
They had me out on the side of the road for ten agonizing minutes while they talked on their radios. The bus driver came out at one point to ask what the holdup was, and they swiftly sent him back on the bus. Now, everyone was concerned. I got Caroline’s attention through the window.
Me: Caroline, grab a pen… My name is Sam Rosenberg, NOT John McEnroe. My mom’s name is Audrey. She lives in Northbrook, Illinois. Please tell her —
Then, it all ended, just like that. No bag check, no pat down, no nothing. They just sent me on my not so merry way, with my passport. The bus driver gave me a snide look, like I’d messed up his schedule, but I didn’t care. I’d dodged another bullet. Simon opened a beer with his teeth and handed it to me.
Simon: This deserves a celebration.
Our hostel wasn’t the most fashionable, but it was cheap, and right downtown. The room fit 8 people. It was the three of us and 5 Italian guys who were all clearly friends. When we got to the room, they were eating spaghetti with their shirts off. It was wildly apropos. When they offered us each a bowl, Caroline and I politely declined. Simon, on the other hand, scarfed one down in less than a minute.
Simon: You call this pasta? It’s shite, mate. Sorry to tell you.
They didn’t understand.
Italian Guy: Si, pasta. Prego, prego.
Me: Prego?
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Caroline: (understanding the double entendre) Not the brand, Sam.
Simon: Ahem, his name is Johnny.
Caroline: It means “you’re welcome.”
Me: Ah, grazie.
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Right down the street from our hostel was a bar called The Dubliner. It looked exactly like you’d expect it to look. There’s no need to even describe it. Irish bars are perfect that way, you always get what you expect, regardless of the country you’re in. The food and liquor are the same, as is the décor. They are, if nothing else, reliable. And reliability is everything.
Caroline and I sat at a table together, drinking Guinness, while Simon roamed around the bar swilling Jameson and accosting random strangers. “I’m here with John McEnroe!” he’d tell anyone who’d listen. He was blacked out. 12 beers in 2 hours will do that to you.
Simon got punched in the face and thrown out within an hour. I didn’t see it but apparently, he spit in some guy’s face after being called a cunt. Then thee guy decked him with a single punch. As someone who used the word so often, I’d expect Simon to be less sensitive to being called one himself. Caroline and I were tossed too because we came with him. He tried fighting every single person on the way out, but Caroline and I just stood there and watched. There was no way I was fighting on his behalf. The last time I did that was in 4th grade when a friend got jumped for using a racial slur. I have regretted it ever since and still think of the guy as a racist piece of shit.
When the hullabaloo concluded, Simon’s face was bloodied, but he still wanted to drink.
Me: You need to go back to the hostel. They won’t let you into a bar with blood all over your face and shirt. That’s surely a universal rule.
Simon: Fuck that. When someone in Dublin gets punched in the face, the bar buys them drinks.
Me: We are not in Dublin.
Caroline: Sam and I are going to eat. You can’t come. You need to rest.
To my amazement, Simon heeded her advice and stumbled back to the hostel to crash. I felt sorry for the Italians because I knew he’d finish their spaghetti and/or try to fight them. At least it was five against one, and Simon could hardly stand, so I wasn’t too worried about them.
Caroline and I set out to find the nicest restaurant we could. We’d both been skimping on money for weeks and finally wanted to splurge now that we were amongst good company. We walked around for half an hour holding hands, chatting about food. Caroline told me she used to cook for her late brother, “Damby,” as she called him (because she couldn’t say “Danny” when she was little). She’d make him minced meat pies on Sundays after church. They were his favorite, and he’d eat them inside-out, saving the crust for last (I do the same). The recipe came from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother before her.
I told her about my Bubbie, and the fried latkes she’d make for me after school. I always thought the jelly would cool them down faster, but it really just cooled the exterior, lulling me into a burnt mouth. I never learned my lesson. We traded food story after food story, our faces lit up, until we had none left.
Food is the easiest way to make bonds, Bourdain taught me that, and I’ve always found it to be true. We all eat.
Downtown Bratislava was way more beautiful than I’d expected. The streets were cobblestone, but the buildings were modern; a dichotomy that somehow worked. It perfectly combined the old world with the new. And the place oozed romanticism. It was like a poem come to life. Everything Disneyland claims to be, Bratislava actually was. If you’re proposing to someone, I suggest doing it there. You will no doubt get a “yes.”
We found a white-tablecloth, French restaurant to dine in. They didn’t seem to care about our casual attire even though the place was fancy, which impressed me. Everyone who can afford a meal should be accommodated, regardless of their attire. Miss me with that classist shit. Before ordering we decided we’d share so we could try more dishes. We got escargot to start. Always start with escargot if they have it. Then we had an omelet, followed by a quiche. For our main courses we shared duck confit and beef bourguignon. Everything was insanely good, like eyes rolling back and moaning good. The price didn’t matter, though they were on the Krona too, so it only came out to what amounted to $40 USD.
We were enveloped in each other that night. The vibes were electric. We flirted and teased, properly, on the walk back. We were about to enter the hostel, when Caroline grabbed my arm.
Caroline: Do you have a girlfriend?
Me: No. Do you have a boyfriend?
Caroline: No.
I knew an opportunity when I saw one, so I leaned in and gave her a kiss.
Caroline: (Pulling away) Just kidding, I do.
Me: What?!
Caroline: Haha, you should see your face.
Me: Why did you do that?
Caroline: To fuck with you.
Me: I don’t appreciate that.
Caroline: (mockingly) I’m Sam, and I don’t appreciate jokes even though I was a comedian. Shut up and kiss me again, you sensitive man you.
I kissed her again, this time pulling her close.
Me: Whoa, that was awesome. Let’s do that more.
I usually say some very awkward shit during and after moments of passion. It’s like the side effect I get from a boner is Tourette’s. I’ve been known to say “thank you” after I cum. It’s not something I’m proud of.
Caroline: I have an idea… How about we go somewhere else, without Simon, and pretend to be a couple? Like, just for a few days. We can go our separate ways after that.
Me: I dig that. But how are we going to get rid of Simon?
Caroline: Leave that up to me.
We made out for a few more minutes before going upstairs. Simon was still passed out, and the Italian guys weren’t back yet, so we laid in my bunk and dry humped quietly for a little while. Part of me couldn’t believe I was hooking up with such an awesome chick, but the other part wished it was Meghan. I kept my mouth shut, as to not ruin our moment, but I felt guilty, like I was using her. Before going to bed, I wrote in my journal:
Why are you like this? Who are you trying to spare in this situation? You’re not even dating Meghan, and Caroline REALLY likes you. You don’t have to be in love with her to have some fun. I mean, you just had sex with a prostitute, how is this worse than that? Ignore your silly morals for once and take a chance. Put yourself out there. Meghan would want you to.
It was easier to ditch Simon than we’d expected because I’m pretty sure he had a concussion. I tried to wake him up a few times, because I knew you weren’t supposed to sleep in that situation, but he kept telling me to fuck off. Caroline finally had enough.
Caroline: Simon, Sam and I are leaving. We will say a prayer for you. Drink water and don’t look directly into bright lights for a few days.
Simon: You cunts. You’re going to leave me here, like this? Sam, I need more speed.
Me: No. And it’s Mr. McEnroe to you.
Caroline pulled me out of the room by my arm before we could hear any more of his pleading. I was insulted by everything Simon did, but that demand infuriated me. I wanted to go back in there and smother him with a pillow. I guess that’s what I get for always seeing the best in people, and for sharing my drugs. Friends like these, eh dude?
Caroline and I went right to the train stop after buying some candy for the trip. She loved the sour stuff. The sourer, the better. In my experience, sweet people like sour candy, and sour people like sweet candy. I’ve ran the numbers, trust me. We didn’t know where to go, so we looked at a map on the wall.
Me: So where to ma’am?
Caroline: Why don’t you just close your eyes and point?
Without waiting for my response, she got behind me and covered my eyes. Then, she spun me around a few times, before placing me back in front of the map. I pointed to a spot.
Caroline: I hear Vienna is nice.

From time to time, I try to improve my Lightroom catalog’s structure to better organize my photos — and while going through my Prague photos, I started noticing patterns in the places I shoot. Sometimes, I go to certain areas on purpose because I know they’re great for photos (or I just want to explore something unfamiliar). Other times, I’m just wandering around without a plan and somehow end up at these familiar places. I realized there are certain locations where I feel more comfortable shooting and where I consistently come home with photos I’m proud of.
Also, I’ve recently received multiple questions on Glass about the best street photography spots in Prague. So, after having lived in Prague and walked its streets for almost two years now (often with a camera in my bag or in my hand), I thought it might be helpful to write about some of these recommended spots.
If you’re visiting Prague, or even if you live here and are looking for good places for street photography, these might be useful for you too.
Let’s start with one of my favorites, a place that always seems to offer something new: the area around the National Theatre (aka Národní divadlo).
The National Theatre is an impressive building with its grand, neo-classical design right on the banks of the river Vltava. What makes this spot truly stand out, though, is the building behind it: the New Stage (Nová scéna), or as the locals call it, “The Ice Cube”. The New Stage couldn’t be more different — it’s modernist (brutalist, to be exact), boxy, and covered in textured glass panels that bounce the light, sometimes in unexpected ways. The contrast between these two buildings, side by side, makes for some great photos, especially if you like playing with old vs. new themes.
But to be a bit cliché here, the buildings are just half of the story. The real magic happens in the life around them. The narrow tram stop in front, with its old red Tatra T3s, is always busy (but not chaotic) with people lined up in a single row, waiting, boarding, or rushing to catch their ride. The open space around the theatre adds a sense of scale, while the narrow passages create more intimate scenes, perfect for experimenting with different compositions, perspectives, and leading lines.
The best time for shooting here is probably a sunny afternoon when the light creates deep shadows and bounces off the glass of the New Stage. This can add depth and contrast to the photos and highlight the theatre’s detailed, brown facade with a warm feel. This effect can be harder to catch in winter when the sun doesn’t rise high enough to be above the buildings. But I’ve also been here on dark, rainy days, and the scene was equally interesting.
I won’t lie — sometimes I feel like I might end up with the same shot over and over if I keep going back. But more often than not (and it surprises me!), that isn’t the case. I’ve tried to figure out what keeps me coming back, and my best answer so far is the mix of the expected and unexpected. One day, you’ll find people going about their usual routines; the next, there might be a street performer, skaters, or a temporary exhibition in the middle of the “inner square.” The stage stays the same, but the act changes. I know, this might sound like a cliché again — what else would you expect in the center of a capital city? — but I’ve found most other areas of Prague more predictable. This balance of routine and surprise, old and new, makes the surroundings of Národní Divadlo an almost endless source of inspiration. At least for me, and at least for now.
Oh, and I’ve found myself growing more fond of these brutalist buildings. And Prague certainly has a few of them. Maybe that’s part of the reason, who knows!
I think the area around the National Theatre is like a small version of what makes Prague so special from a street photography perspective. It’s got history, modern architecture, and plenty of street life. If you’re looking for a spot that will spark new ideas for street photography, this is a good place to start — maybe even the best.
Thanks for reading to the end! If you enjoyed this or have any thoughts, I’d appreciate your 👏 claps and comments — especially if you’ve already taken photos here or are planning to visit Prague with a camera.
Small note:During my preparation, I came across an article mentioning that the Ice Cube will undergo renovations starting next summer, which are expected to last for several years. So, you might want to hurry up and visit before it starts!

Which part of Himachal are you from?I am actually not from Himachal, but from Madhya Pradesh.But you’re a Thakur?Yes, MP as well has Thakurs.
This is how my first interaction with most people at Himachal Pradesh (the northern state that hosts my workplace IIT Mandi) begins, people with last name Thakur being omnipresent here. However, perhaps the most famous Thakur was from West Bengal (a state in the East of India), and interestingly, he is known more commonly as a Tagore in India. At Prague — the city of hundred spires — though, my stay was booked at Thakurova — the Thakur street — and so I knew I would be welcome at Czechia.
My trip to Boston (recall Tryst with America?) had made me acquaintance with Prof. Jan Vitek’s group at Northeastern University. I met him again during ECOOP 2019 (recall Romance at London?) — we knew we were working in similar areas — so he suggested I visit his laboratory at Czech Technical University, where I would hopefully be able to formalize a working relationship. And thus the seed to a trip to Prague — one of my most memorable trips ever — was sown.
In general I would have been worried about the cold weather at Prague in January. However, having settled after the London trip at Mandi, in one of the coldest states of India, I wasn’t much excited (read worried) about the weather. This, however, also translated to not being prepared for the trip at all. My first teaching semester at IIT Mandi ended in December, and it was only after that, that I started planning a trip — my longest abroad till date — to Prague in January. Two things I was more thoughtful about, though, were (i) The Visa; and (ii) The Trip to Delhi — you will get to know a very suspenseful story about both in Rendezvous with Athena. TLDR: The Visa was smooth, I travelled to Delhi a day before this time, and hence obtained a comfortable flight hopping for an hour at Sharjah (the place I knew from childhood for Cricket matches).
Prague is known to be a beautiful city, and a very welcoming one for tourists. I was supposed to stay 12 nights at a hostel-cum-hotel (wrongly known as a dorm) named Masaryk Colej. The second word indicates its association with the college CVUT (Czech Technical University, in English). Travel from the airport was quite comfortable: you buy an hourly ticket for public travel in Prague and can then take any bus, tram, or metro — very convenient for those who don’t understand the currency or the local addresses. So I took a bus and a tram (Pristi zastavka) and reached the hotel. First surprise: I was provided with a map to find my room! And indeed, the map was damn useful — you need to pass through a cobweb of rooms (smelling the varieties of food college guys keep cooking in there) to finally reach the corridor that forms the “hotel” part of the huge building. I needed the map on quite a few occasions (specially when I decided to wander around the building trying to get a glimpse of the food).
I used to walk daily to the university, take the lift to the 13th floor (tried the stairs one day!), and come back in the evening. Pretty standard. So what I would do next, is to mainly discuss the interesting trips — solo as well as group — along with the classical places I visited, the people I met, and the heart-warming experiences that I got in the extremely cold weather (subzero on almost all days). Not to forget the funny stories surrounding the food!
This was the first time I was visiting a place that’s famous for its exotic food — but almost all non-veg. The first day I located a Pizza outlet with vegetarian options, about 1.5 miles from my hotel. I had taken my warmest clothes, but God it was really difficult following Google Map as you need to take your gloves off (I got enlightened about touchscreen-enabled gloves much later). Being in Europe I knew I didn’t have to worry much about tips and the phrases for taking home versus dining-in as in the US (Europe and India have pretty much similar terminologies, owing to history). Breakfasts were taken care of by the hotel (with two kinds of cupcakes, orange juice, toast, and cheese forming the 365-day menu). Lunches (and some dinner outings on weekdays): I knew I would have enough expertise from the lab in sailing through the university canteen. However, things became adventurous when I decided to try the hotel restaurant for a dinner:
Me: “Which all options in the menu are vegetarian?”She: [After the previous sentence being looped over 20 times]: “Yes, please sit; we will bring you vegetarian.”
On table I get something that looks very muttonish. After making some noise the chef came out of the kitchen; he understood some English and told I could get a replacement without paying again.
Me: “Which dish will you get for me?”He: “Vegetarian.”
Finally I got some cauliflower (in its purest vegetarian, read raw, form) and some fried (read oil-soaked) potatoes. I ate about 30% from my plate, then boiled MTR Poha (puffed rice) carried from home in the hot water obtained from the geyser-that-actually-worked-only-in-the-morning, and knew this was the end of trying out my luck at the hotel (apart from breakfast). On the remaining days I mostly sticked to the long menu of a Chinese restaurant next door (147 dishes, 3 vegetarian), an occasional Pizza from the chilly-walk place, and my MTR Pohas cooked with the morning-only geyser.
However, one night we had a fine dinner at an Indian restaurant (where I again found that Indians have a much stronger digestive system, think spices); I tried some tasty soups with two new friends on a beautiful evening; and on the last day finally tried the national dish (which happens to be vegetarian) — Fried cheese:
As indicated before, Prague is perhaps the city with the most convenient public transport: You can just install an app and charge it with your card for a day (not expensive at all), get a barcode that is your ticket, and travel as you want in any tram, bus, metro, or train. Moreover, the city is very-well covered — you perhaps don’t need to walk more than a few hundred meters anywhere — you will have nicely maintained, well-timed, clean-and-safe public transport available at the blink of an eye. I had listed down a large number of places to visit, and divided them into two days: Day 1 and Day 2, for the Saturday and the Sunday.
If you followed me in America, you know that the first thing on my list in a city that has a zoo, has to be a zoo. So Saturday began with visiting one of the best places hosting animals in the world: The Prague Zoo. Unlike the Zoo at Washington DC, at Prague you are welcomed with the star cast quite near to the entrance:
I spent nearly 3 hours at the zoo, walking about 8 kilometers inside, and ended with a team of as-tall-as-can-get Giraffes, and as-cute-as-can-get Penguins:
The next stop was The Old Town across Charles bridge (challenge: find the river in the lab-view above). Old Town has several attractions from the times Czechia was part of the Soviet Union, with several churches and castles at every turn. While the Prague Castle reminds one of Hogwarts, the Astronomical Clock attracts a huge crowd every hour for witnessing one of the many scientific marvels associated with the same (read more on Wikipedia):
Charles Bridge is a heritage on its own, with so many activities and picture-spots around that you can spend hours walking across and yet find something every time you cross! A beautiful view of the colorful city follows:
I finished traversing the Old Town by filling my bag at a shop full of candies (and forgetting the bag mid-way during my return journey)!
Having explored the crowded places the previous day, I decided to spend a solo Sunday climbing hills and exploring castles — both being rare opportunities in a vibrant city. The day was cold and hazy, but I walked and walked like crazy.
Vysehrad is an old castle in a bit far-off location, and should be traveled in broad day-light, is what I was told. Though the far-off part was true, I found the place full of people craving for silent time amidst the hustle and bustle of the cheerful city. You could sit there for hours with a book in hand, appreciating the rare greenery in the coldest of months.
The last I went was The Petrin Hill — reminiscent of the hikes I do around Mandi. I went up via a crowded rope-way and came down exploring solitary paths watching the city of hundred spires; as you descend, you realize every climb has its end, but the walk downhill doesn’t necessarily take you down.
If you ever visit Prague, do roam around the colorful streets, but take a moment walking up/down the Petrin Hill, sitting on that bench I couldn’t, and wondering “what to eat next” :-)
I returned back via Warsaw; the trip was prepended with a day’s stay with an about-to-be-engaged friend at New Delhi, and appended with a trip to Kolkata — a city where you drive ahead with both the legs on breaks (for preserving its classical past) — to attend the engagement of the same (more about my old-and-gold friends some time later!).
The series had promised an article every few weeks: it started swiftly, but has been going on rather slow. For me, the year 2020 has been full of remembering (read missing) the travels from 2019, and avid readers are in for many more write-ups. For now, an assurance is to have a few more articles than those promised in the intro A Traveling Year, one of them being exclusively on the rather long airport stays and flight journeys (of course with feedback on the food) I have had in the travel-rich year! So keep reading, and stay on…

I’m leaving the hotel bright and early and as I’m about to pack up I detected the quintessential bible that ever hotel ought to have (not!!!), only that here they had a rather unusual version of it.
I then stopped at a local bakery where I had the weakest coffee ever. I think I just don’t know how to (or rather what to) order. This actually begs the question: How much of a language is it courtesy to learn when visiting a country where one doesn’t speak the language? I understand zero Czech and here in the countryside the folks don’t tend to speak English. Maybe I should’ve tried German? After all, the city of Litoměřice — where I spent the night — was once part of the “Province of German Bohemia” and the town actually still has a German name: Leitmeritz. Well, I didn’t end up learning any Czech here at this bakery and instead made myself understandable with pointing at various items in the display case.
After breakfast, I hit the road. As I was passing the train station I saw a cool structure: a bike tower. I guess it’s for the folks commuting by train to work? This part of the country is certainly set up for cycling, with the Elbe-Labe Cycling Path probably contributing considerably to the local community. Later, I saw another cycle-friendly piece of infrastructure: a solar-powered charging station for e-bike.
Today’s first section of the route continued taking me along the river Elbe. As it was still rather early in the day, I saw a lot of fisherman sitting by the river and waiting for fish to latch on. There were so many of them and all of them men. I was wondering: How come women don’t do fishing? Seems like a relaxing activity. Maybe because they need to do the housework and tend to the kids while the men are frolicking their hobby?
On a similarly gender-related note, I noticed the below cycling path signs. Maybe someone would like to write a thesis on stereotypes in (modern) street signage? Questions that come to mind: Who still wears a hat like this? Do men really have the time to walk their daughters to school? Aren’t they too busy fishing? Discuss.
What I noticed since entering Czechia is that the Elbe here has several dams and so instead of a river, it often looks more like a lake. At one point today, I crossed one of these dams/locks and there were quite a few things to see.
Just like yesterday, I had the option to do a shortcut and arrive in Prague much faster: As rivers tend to meander, you can choose to go a straighter route. I decided to not be straight and instead follow the river path, which added a good 30km. I did this, because one of the highlights along the route was the river mouth where the Vltava (Moldau) and merges into the Labe (Elbe).
By the time I hit Mělník, I have to admit that I was starting to get tired. The next opportunity for food was not for another 25km and I was getting hungry. I stopped at a little convenience store to buy some fruits and water and that tied me over. The wind picked up and at some point I was cycling underneath a big dark cloud, which at eventually unloaded in a swift shower. I quickly found shelter underneath a tree, with view of a lovely castle.
Eventually, I arrived in an industrial-looking town and at the big roundabout I had a fundamental decision to make: Where should I buy my lunch from? The Lidl or the Tesco? Or, in other words: Supporting a German or British corporation? You can ask me next time you see me, which team I voted for. In any case, my fancy lunch consisted of two slices of pepperoni pizza and a sweet roll…all eaten at the back of the large supermarket building next to some vagabonds.
Then came the exciting part of the day and it literally elevated my heart rate: at some point my bike app showed me to cut through some forest area instead of following the river. Upon investigation, I saw that the stretch along the river was deemed “dangerous” by some cyclists. But the reckless person I am, I decided to choose the perilous option. Well, let’s just say this: I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, unless you have a mountain bike and like the thrill of cycling dangerously close to a cliff. To calm my nerves, I was humming the melody of Smetana’s Die Moldau, which was only fitting as I was cycling along its shores…
Since I’d sweated so much during this last stretch and since my destination for the day was in relatively close proximity, I decided to sit down at one of the very popular riverside kiosks for a glass of refreshing beer. What a great decision!
Eventually I arrived at the campsite and luckily they still had a space for me. The campground is just outside Prague city center and conveniently located next to a tram stop. After I’d set up camp, I took said mode of transport instead of my bike and ventured into the city.
Honestly, I was quite knackered and knew it wouldn’t be a night of partying. But, I wanted to enjoy a good meal and so I consulted Yelp and followed the recommendations for a restaurant called Vinohradský Parlament. It’s a beautiful restaurant and the waiter was fantastic. He recommended a hearty meal for me as I was telling him that I’d just cycled 100km and was rather famished. Their specialty are Czech dumplings (knedlíky) and this pillowy soft delicacy was perfect to soak up the juices that came with my beef roulade. For dessert, I had another kind of dumpling: this one stuffed with fresh blueberries! Yummy!
Afterwards, I was so tired that — after a brief wander around the city — I got back on the tram to my tent.

Well, they say! Home is where our heart is. I left a small part of my heart at the golden hour over the Charles Bridge.
With the busy life we all have, traveling is the place where you destress. Life with a toddler is never easy. I started to rethink the concept of traveling after my child was born.
Sigh! With the doubts and rethinking, we finally started planning our travel to open our summer in Europe. Springs are really special in Europe. That is when you still can’t find many tourists in the beautiful cities.
Luckily we started this whole trip with the right planning. We thought to make a fun road trip through the Autobahn. We live in the beautiful city of Utrecht province, and all our planning was around this.
Riding through the autobahn and landscapes of Germany, we were entertained well and our heart was calm. After a long journey and our halts through cute stops in Germany, we finally reached Prague at nearly midnight.
Tiring ourselves through sitting, we just wanted to rest our heads on the pillow, but our little one wanted to swim. Through a lot of convincing, we had a good night’s sleep. My subconscious mind made me feel for a while, we were still driving in the car, but my tired eyes were not able to focus on thoughts and we slept.
Our next day started with a nice morning view of the city of Prague through the large side windows of our hotel room.
Pro tip: Try to find a hotel where, your little one can enjoy amenities and activities like swimming, playroom, or lawn. This keeps them happy through the day and grownups can have a stroll.
After a great breakfast and swim, we finally started exploring Prague.
Our first stop was at the Prague castle complex, where we walked and witnessed the glorious monuments of St. Vitus Cathedral, a former royal palace, and other museums. The collection of views of the cities was breathtaking. One could also visit Golden Lane in the same complex. Never forget to click a picture here, just a great way to summarise your castle tour.
Pro tip: Check for tickets at any information center in Prague city. There is only a collective ticket available for all the important monuments.
A modern bold building by Architect Vlado Milunić along with Frank Gehry. Originally it was named Ginger and Fred building after the dancers. The bold piece of art is in the middle of the busy street, otherwise on your way to the famous walking route of old Prague city and the famous bridges.
Walking down the 15th-century Golden Lane took us back to those days. This preserved street is just worth experiencing, as most of the fort is reconstructed to adapt to current days.
This was a cute short ride, which our little one enjoyed. The funicular is been in operation since 1891. During the season( Between Apr-May season) you can enjoy cherry blossoms and other beautiful trees on this hill. The hill also has an interesting observatory. But it is a good experience on a sunny day to walk down the hill with your little one
Pro tip: You can have public transport 24-hour tickets at the information center or on any tram/ bus itself. I would suggest watching the YouTube channel HONEST GUIDE. He spoke about everything a tourist needs in Prague to walk like a confident local
Our final destination…..🥁🥁🥁
We started from our nearest metro station and walked through the beautiful old town of Prague. Our important pit stop was to witness the oldest astronomical clock in the world which is dated back to 1410, at the old town square. What is it? one may ask. If it interests you further, Astronomical clock.
Taking our imagination of walking through the 18th century, we reached the arch of Charles Bridge. Magnificent as it is, it took us to an old world that is built over the Vltava River. The 30 Baroque statues welcomed us to witness the glory of history.
We were lucky enough to reach the bridge in the golden hour. That is when I fell in love with Prague. Romantic Prague! We witnessed a rainbow which made it the perfect end to our romantic walk. We witnessed the sun going down dancing into colorful narration.
Further, when the sun went down. The view into the castle and of the city was spectacular.
I hope you enjoyed my little narration and it helped you to plan your future trip to Prague or made you remember your best evening.
Thank you for reading!

Since arriving in Eastern Europe, I’ve never experienced cloudy weather until now. At 7 in the morning, I dragged my tired body out for breakfast. Our accommodation offers an outdoor terrace, allowing us to enjoy the warm sunshine while savoring bread and morning orange juice.
It seems that Czech is as famous for its apples as it is for its dark beer. Everywhere we went, apples were being sold, and there were many bread and dishes containing apples. Although I didn’t crave any special taste, thinking about my growling stomach as I walked, I grabbed an apple and hurriedly set off for Prague again today.
Havel Market & Trdelník
We went straight to the traditional market in Prague that we had been eager to visit, Havel Market. Unfortunately, there were a few things that left us slightly disappointed:

is an ancient city filled with a long history of mystery, with much more than meets the eye. I recently had the pleasure of visiting this amazing city in August 2023. It was a last minute trip, so I truly had zero expectations for what to expect. Soon after landing, I realized I had stumbled upon an alchemical city filled with intrigue and magic! You can feel a buzzing energy once you step into this uniquely built city. The buildings and streets all seem to be laid in some perfect, symmetrical grid. Prague Castle sits high up on the hill, giving off an almost invincible feeling as you look upon it. This was the home of the Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who was obsessed with Alchemy, and the pursuit of the Philospher’s Stone. King Charles built The Charles Bridge in 1357, built strategically with astronomers and numerologists, to align the bridge and towers with the rising and setting of the sun. Prague was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire in 1300’s, and is where King Charles oversaw The Golden Age of Bohemia.
There is an abundance of mysticism and symbolism throughout the city, which is filled with alchemical bars, fascinating museums, and the famous astrological clock that brings the city center to life. Visiting Prague is certainly a portal to the old world, which lead the way for modern pharmacy and medicines. Praha truly seems to be covered in magic, and I highly recommend you visit this mystic, legendary city. Here are my 3 reasons why Prague should be high up on your travel itinerary.
I am not the biggest fan of cities, but Prague was a city full of wonder and mystery. The roads told a story of a distant past, the aged buildings still etched with beautiful gargoyles, symbols and designs, still dimly shining their radiance. I was immediately in awe at how well preserved the historic buildings and statues were. It truly felt like I was in a medieval movie, moving forward on my own alchemical journey. The city seemed old, yet proud, with all of its traditions and secrets. I am fascinated by stories of alchemy and have enjoyed researching this field for years; and now I stumbled upon a whole alchemical city. Just my luck!
One of the most notable proponents of alchemy was the Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who ruled and lived in Prague until his death in 1612. He was a very curious leader, who encouraged alchemists, astronomers, philosophers to travel to Prague and share their teachings. This was technically their modern day medicine, so Rudolph naturally built his own laboratory at the castle. He was obsessed with find the Philosopher’s stone, which according to legend is the key to the Elixir for immortal life. He brought over Edward Kelley, a self proclaimed spirit medium, and John Dee, occultist and Mathematician. You can visit a recreation of the alchemical laboratory Rudolph had in the Prague Castle.
This museum houses real alchemical laboratories, only recently discovered in 2002 due to intense flooding and road erosion. Within the museum they found herbs, flasks, and more in an underground complex of labs and rooms. The underground labs still contain original glassworks, rooms, and kilns the alchemist’s used for transmuting lead to gold. It is an incredible experience to set foot where true alchemists have stepped foot, creating and experimenting with elixirs that have changed the face of medicine today. The underground is truly remarkable, and filled with different tunnels and passageways. They offer a guided tour of 30 minutes, which is actually packed with interesting information and sights, which I highly recommend!
This marvel within Prague is one of the main landmarks you will see in Prague. This bridge, which used to be a main crossing between East and West Europe, was built in 1357 by King Charles in accordance with the palindromic number 13579753. King Charles worked with astronomers and numerologists on how, where, and when to build this historic bridge. By working with the stars and numerology, Charles constructed the bridge to align with planetary energy, and to align with the rising and setting of the sun. Pretty advanced stuff for 700 years ago! Along the bridge there are several sculptures of historical figures that represent Prague’s long history. You can take a boat tour that take you around the bridge and gives you heaps of interesting information about the bridge, its past, and the Prague Castle.
There are rumors that Prague was laid out in a geometrical shape, adhering to symmetry and planetary grids. I truly feel like this is not far from the truth. I’ve traveled to some amazing energy vortexes in my life, and it was quite surprising to find the energy still strong, even within this bigger city. There are also many underground tunnels, and small street that seem to go on forever. Get lost in these mystic streets, and who knows, maybe you’ll find what you’re looking for!
This is a no-brainer! Prague Castle is the biggest castle complex in the world, and you can certainly tell when you visit. It stand watch high over Prague, a beautiful sight to see from almost anywhere in the city. The complex and intricate design of the roofs and towers of the castle are truly an ode to the complexities of life and nature. It is remarkable to see such a great feat done and still standing from so long ago. The original Prague Castle was built in the 9th century, yet you can still get a good idea of what the original felt like! It seems time skipped over this part of the world, still revealing clues to our distant past. The castle is filled with sculptures, angels, demons, and scars of its’ past. Walk around the Castle and marvel in its wonder. It is a nice walk up a hill, so do be prepared! It’s all worth it once you get to the top, as the view from the city is truly amazing. It also holds the Guinness Book of World Record for largest Castle Complex!
I found one of my favorite bars in the world. I really enjoy Alchemy, and its rare to find a place that is Alchemically themed, and done well. I won’t give away the location, as you will need to find it yourself ( come on, alchemist!), but this is a must do here in Prague. Their bar will brew some mystic elixirs that may enhance Alchemical power and insight. The whole bar has really cool decorations (its very own Hermit), and the menu is filled with illustrations and sayings that will have you rethinking your life.
Prague is a short train ride away from Plzin, the official home of the Pilsner Beer. It actually got ripped off from a famous American brand, which isn’t totally surprising! Prague is actually the leader in the world for most beers consumed per capita. Prague is lined with traditional pubs and restaurants, ready for you to try some of their unique dishes. It is a charming place with lots of history, and people seem to gravitate to small pubs and places to eat, and just talk and observe the beauty. Get yourself a cold one and kick your feet up, buddy!
Czech goulash is a pretty unique, tasty traditional meal that should try. A Proper homemade Czech Goulash is prepared by first braising chunks of stewing beef with potatoes, tomato, onions, paprika and garlic. This serving is usually served with crusty bread, boiled dumplings or noodles. Wash it down with an ice cold glass of pilsner lager like an original Pilsner Urquell.
I am a big fan of shows like Vikings because I get to fantasize about how it was to live in earlier times. Times before electricity, before the internet and before mobile phones. I was able to really feel like I had stepped in the past in Prague. Being from the States, its rare to see such ancient feeling buildings, roads and infrastructure. You can go to so many museums, shops, cathedrals, and shop within just Prague alone. The city seems to be proud of its rich heritage, and they have preserved much of its history. There are many important historical events and figures that have traversed to the City of Alchemy, and have surely been amazed by its’ charm. Enjoy the never ending wonders within the streets of this magical city.
There is a big bohemian energy in Czech, which makes sense, since it is originally the home of the Kingdom of Bohemia. There are many crystal shops, yoga places, and mystic shops sprinkled throughout. I was lucky enough to know a few friends out there, and was able to see another side of Czechia outside of the city. The forest truly seem to contain fairies within them; there is that mystic charm that I have heard so much about of the enchanting European forests. The soil is fertile and lush, the people content and beautiful in their own ways. There is a quiet and calm energy all throughout the countryside. If you are like me, you enjoy some solitude and retreat into nature and chance you may get. This was a welcome treat after traveling through other busy cities in Europe.
I was able to see some less travelled places in Czech, and the charm only grew from there. The people were very welcoming, and the natural beauty really held me in its arms. It feels a lot more simple in the countryside, where they are unburdened by the heaviness of the city. If you can, take a train outside of the city, take a walk through nature, and eat a mom and pop restaurant. Thank me later.
Get to Prague if you are traveling nearby in Europe! If the mystic, magical, and mysterious intrigues you, I guarantee you will have a great time if you travel to Prague. There is a treasure trove of secrets and history amongst the castles, museums and ancient river. The old cobblestone roads, mixed with goulash and Pilsners, will captivate your senses as you gaze upon historic marvels. Satisfy your craving for more alchemical tools along your hero’s journey! This geometrically aligned city has more secrets waiting to be revealed. I would take at least 3–5 days to explore most of Prague and the surrounding towns. Take the leap into the unknown and travel into this City of Alchemy.

In my Previous work at GoodData, I had a chance to have two business trips to Prague, Czech Republic. Before joining GoodData, I have never been to any European counties east of Germany or Austria. In 2022, our team had trouble finding sales engineers in the Czech Republic, so everyone in our team was taking turns working in Prague to cover the European business timezone. Therefore, I went to Prague to help out the sales representatives in Prague as a temporary sales engineer in May 2022 and September 2022.
First time to “This Part of Europe”This is my first time visiting the Czech Republic, and also the first time visiting a former Warsaw Pact country. I was very curious about how the country transformed after the Berlin Wall broke 30 years later, and how much does the Czech Republic different from the European countries I have been to. Most of my colleagues asked me whether this is the first time I visit Europe, I told them: “This is the first time I have been to ‘This Part of Europe’”.
My first impression of the Czech Republic is Soviet architecture in the suburban, Pre-Modern Austro-Hungarian city-style Downtown, Modern Western European office buildings in the business area. When I arrived in Prague airport, the airport is obviously built during the former Warsaw Pact era the building is very rectangular and lack of decoration, which creates a contradiction when modern Boeing or Airbus aircraft were parked against it. Although the highways looked new and well-maintained, I can still see some poor-maintained Soviet-style buildings in the suburban area. Once the taxi enters Prague’s city limit, the city's appearance changed to the beautiful 19th-century Austro-Hungarian city-style Downtown, mixed with newly built Western European office buildings. I am able to see the overview memories of the Czechs in the form of Prague architecture.
No One Calls it CzechiaDuring my stay in Prague, I have more opportunities to talk with the locals since I was working with them for a couple of weeks. I literally hear none of the Czech call their country Czechia. They mostly call their country by their full name — the Czech Republic, or the country abbreviation — CZ (American Zee) or CZ (British Zat). It appears that Czechs in general really don’t like the new name for their country (I personally call it the Czech Republic too).
Another interesting thing I learnt in Prague is that the relationship between Czechs and Slovakians is not as close as I thought. I learnt from an American YouTuber that Czechs and Slovakians are culturally close so their relationship is as intimate as siblings, but one of my Prague colleagues disagreed.
The City AppearanceDowntown Prague is a very beautiful city where the beauty came from the late Middle Ages and pre-Modern style buildings next to tram routes. The iconic Soviet-style Prague trams ran between those buildings are the only confusion that you think you are visiting a Warsaw Pact country in the latter half of the 20th century, but you realize there are newly built Austrian trams replacing the aging iconic trams when they pass by occasionally.
Sadly, most of my time in Prague was spent at the GoodData headquarter and I did not have a lot of chance to go around the city, besides Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and Petrin Tower.
Office Culture is a Mixture of American and Continent EuropeAlthough GoodData originated from the Czech Republic, the company culture was relatively Americanized. Besides the office appearance looks very no different from a Tech company in the San Francisco Bay Area, the work culture is basically the same! The atmosphere in the GoodData headquarter embraces creativity, work-life balance, and the work-hard-play-hard mentality. During my stay in Prague, I feel the work environment in the Prague office is the same as in the San Francisco office.
Czechs are very easy to work with: They are not as serious as German, nor lazy. They will deliver what you need on time, as long as they have a proper summer break (3–4 weeks off), which does not exist in the Anglophone countries. Their impression of American work culture is a hard work culture with an insufficient amount of holidays — One of my colleagues mentioned he was impressed (negatively) that American mothers can only take 10 weeks of paid maternity time off that he does not wish to live in the US if his wife and he are planning to have kids.
Czech FoodBesides Pilnser, anyone who visits the Czech Republic should try any duck dish since Czech ducks taste very taste! One of the common duck dishes in the Czech Republic is duck confit (Which is also common in Slovakia, Austria, and maybe Poland?), although my Czech colleagues always laugh at me eating what they eat on Sunday prepared by their grandmas. This grandma's dish usually serves with Czech dumplings and pickles to ease the duck grease.
On my second trip to Prague, half of my team was actually visiting Prague. Therefore, my manager decided to bring us to a team lunch. Although my manager is a Czech who lived in San Francisco, he acts very differently when he is in Prague. When he was bringing us to lunch in San Francisco, he brought us to cafes with health choices; in contrast, he would have brought us to a cafe close to our Prague office too, but the first thing to order is wine. I bet Europeans are very flexible in switching their culture mode wherever they are at.
Prague has quite a big portion of the Vietnamese population (They have mostly immigrated to the Czech Republic in the 70’s and 80’s), so there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants or shops serve pho and Vietnamese sandwiches. Not surprisingly, there are a lot of Chinese restaurants; however, most of those Chinese restaurants not only serve Chinese dishes, but also Japanese, Korean, and Thai dishes as well…
Czechs in General Hates the Communist EraWorking in a company with Czech heritage allows me to understand the Czechs. I thought the Czechs have some degree of good memories from the Communist Era, but I was wrong! The upper managers in GoodData sent memos to us during the pandemic to make up the communication supposed to be done on-site, I remember one of the memos was sent during the week of the celebration of the Velvet Revolution for embracing freedom gained after the end of communist-ruled Czechoslovakia.
During the last week of my first Prague visit, I was planning to watch an opera in the State Opera House. While I was discussing with my colleagues how to get to the opera house from the office, one of my colleagues started to complain about the city planning policy during the Communist Era (Out of nowhere too…but he has a point). He was complaining about the fact that a highway was built next to the opera house, which made complicated and inconvenient pedestrian access and prevented the highway to build straight to avoid the road cutting through the building (If a highway is not straight enough, then it is not fast). Although I tried not to give any opinion on this topic as an outsider, I can see the reputation of the previous era has left a bruise on the Czechs.
Prague Castle and Charles BridgeMy colleagues were nice to bring me to visit Prague Castle and Charles Bridge after Wednesday work and had dinner together next to Prague Castle.
My impression of Prague Castle is not a castle! To me, a castle is a walled building built in the Middle Age or before for the landlord to live; Prague Castle looks like a pre-Modern era palace, which is a couple of hundred years ahead of its time.
We had dinner and beer afterward. And of course, my colleagues ordered something that I never had. One of those is Chicken liver paté.
After dinner, we walk from Prague Castle and across Charles Bridge to take the metro. During the walk, my colleagues explained Prague Castle and Charles Bridge. I really enjoyed visiting the sightseeing spots with the locals rather than guides because the locals know what the sightseeing spots are, but they can’t remember hard fact details like the year when built and historical figures, it makes them more authentic rather than a guide who tries to impress you.
Petrin TowerIf I have to pick one must-see sightseeing spot it has to be Petrin Tower, over Prague Castle or Charles Bridge. I personally am attracted by the architecture of Prague, therefore, Petrin Tower is the best place to view Prague from a bird's view.
BeerI save this topic to the last — Beer! Basically: Czech Republic = Beer. So that you can understand how important beer is to the Czechs. Among all the national brands, Pilsner is the best for me. Pilsner is a lager that has a very light body with some pine finish, it is a very refreshing beverage, especially for summer! One good reason to visit Prague: Pilsner is significantly taster when serve in draft beer than in cans!
During my second visit to Prague, my company had an offsite in a local theater in Prague. Interestingly, beer was served between breaks for the whole afternoon, but no one was drunk by the end of all presentations at 6 pm. Czechs simply cannot get drunk on beer (Not sure whether that is a good thing or not). I am not a person who is crazy for nightlife so I don’t consider myself a good dancer, one of my male colleagues was impressed with my dance move. He asked me how he can dance as well as me, I told him the key is to get drunk since I don’t have a good answer for him so I joked with him. He was quite a humour to say: “That’s the problem! We Czechs are hard to get drunk.” Quite an answer!
ConclusionI really love Prague, and so does the Czech Republic. I really like the architecture of Prague, the city vibe, the city, and the people! They gave me a good time when I was visiting Prague. It is a very nice place to visit as you would learn a lot from the people and the city. It is also very affordable to visit. A 3-star hotel night (May or October) is less than 100 Euros in the city center, and a decent dine-in meal cost you about 20 Euros with beer and coffee. It is worth your money, not only on seeing Charles Bridge and Prague Castle but also I am pretty sure both Prague and the Czech Republic can give you a Central European vibe that you can enjoy. I am not sure when next time, but next time I got to visit as a tourist! And I really miss Pilsner too!

Currently, in the middle of the corona pandemic crisis, it might not be the right time to travel unfortunately. Last year I was on a little eurotrip and one of the places I visited was Prague in the Czech Republic. If you’re sitting at home watching Triple X and dreaming about where to go next after all this is over then here are some budget tips on what to do in one of the most beautiful cities in central Europe.
Walk around in the old town
With documented settlements dating back over a thousand years and current buldings such as the Old Town Hall with the foundation being built in the 14th century, Prague’s old town called Staré Město in the Czech language will leave you with a magical feeling.
This is a must and quite frankly difficult to avoid since the medieval Staré Město is smack in the middle of the city center. Go see the astronomical clock which was installed in 1410, the old town square, the stands in the narrow streets and the Charles bridge. If you look around closely you might find some cosy hidden restaurants such as the Charles Bridge Restaurant which is basically a floating barge, sitting on the water by the base of the bridge on the Old town side. Pro tip: You might also wanna try the local Czech cuisine at some smaller place around the corner on a side street away from the tourist rush. That’s generally how I’ve stumbled on some of the best food on my trips. The Czech cuisine resembles other central and east European dishes such as goulash, various soups and pancakes, bread dumplings, schnitzel and baked meat. For a drink you should try any Czech beer. It really doesn’t matter which one you choose, they all taste magnificient and much better than at home.
Prague is literally a city of bridges, it has over 300 hundred of them, so there are many more to see than just the Charles bridge. Each with their own history to tell. Some other famous ones are the Legion bridge, the Mánes Bridge and the Palacký Bridge.
Visit the St. Vitus Cathedral and the Castle complex
This huge breathtaking gothic style cathedral is the largest church in the Czech republic. The main tower is over 100 metres high (328+ feet) and the cathedral itself is situated on top of a large hill which is housing the Prague Castle complex. From the hill you are able to see most of Prague’s center and the nature around it. One of the slopes even has a vineyard.
The castle is very big and was originally built in the 9th century and went on being improved up until the mid 19th century. Because of all the different eras in which it was constructed it consists of different architectural styles. Inside the complex are several museums in which you can learn all about the history of the Czech republic and also the famous so called Golden Lane. There are also several art galleries, small cafe’s and shops, although it might be bit of a tourist trap. Be wary of the prices and unnecessary touristic small stuff.
Go up the Petřín Hill
A large hill is situated just off the center on the other side of the Vltava river above the Malá Strana district. The top is higher than the castle hill and rises 130 metres above the river. From there you can get some amazing views over Prague. The Petřín Hill is a popular rectreational area and almost the entire hill is covered in parks. The so called Hunger Wall was built in the 14th century on the hill and is still there to be visited.
There is also a tall Eiffel styled lookout tower which you can visit for a fee. Although for sure a nice view I would however say that it’s not worth its price, and if you walk past by over to the Strahov Stadium (one of the largest stadiums ever built) there is a nice view point there by the tunnel ventilation tower. Although still in use, the stadium is a remnant of the old communist era. The tunnel towers has an interesting modernism style and were built and designed in the 80’s and 90’s by an architect called Jiří Trnka.
To get to the top of the hill you can either walk, take the bus or tram or the funicular rail. If you’re walking from the city center there is a restaurant on the way up called Petřínské terasy. It’s situated straight up to the west of the Kampa riverside. Grab a bite with Czech styled food and enjoy the view over the city and the castle if you’re hungry or just step by for a drink.
While not a super fancy place, they do offer weddings and it has a large outdoor terrace. Inside you can enjoy the lumberjack styled pub and restaurant. They also have a large open fireplace that you can watch while you’re sitting and relaxing reading Frommer’s.
Check out the Vítkov hill Monument
There’s another hill in the Žižkov district on the opposite side of the city center which is called Vítkov. On top of it is a memorial monument that features a large granite stone plaza and a large grey bulding. A huge bronze statue is standing on a pedestal in front of the building resembling Jan Žižka, who in 1420 in the Battle of Vítkov Hill defeated enemy forces.
The memorial monument was mainly built in the 1930’s but had to be paused when the WWII started and the Germans occupied the land. It was later finished and was for a while used to promote communism. In 2000–2009 a renovation work was made by the National Museum and was reopened for the public to enjoy. From this place you will have one of the best views over Prague. It’s especially extraordinary in the sunset and many people are coming there to watch it.
Bonus tip: Around the Seifertova street nearby are several cocktail bars for having a little preparty or a drink on the way into the Old Town districts. You should maybe not stay too late as it might get noisy in this area and filled with drunk people.
Also nearby, on the other side of the railroad is a beautiful church called the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius, and just past it is a small asian place called Ngô where they serve fantastic food. This is a convenient area to stay in and with walking distance from the Old Town so look for hotels here. I stayed at Hotel Alwyn which is a pretty good hotel.
Have a drink at a roof bar
Roof bars are getting more and more popular and Prague has them as well. There is for example a nice one on top of the Hotel U Prince, nearby the Old Town Hall, with 360° views over the city. There is a restaurant so you can enjoy a bite and they make their own signature cocktails. It’s possible to stumble upon higher priced places but this one is still fairly reasonably priced. Just enter the hotel at street level and look for a glassed elevator, it will take you up to the roof restaurant and terrace. Other roof bars worth a visit are Cloud 9 in the large Hilton hotel, CODA restaurant in the Malá Strana district, Duplex in the center and T-anker in the old town.
Generally you will find value for your money in Prague and in the Czech republic. They have their own currency, Czech crowns, but might accept euros in some places. In smaller restaurants they might be slightly reluctant to taking cards for some reason so be sure to bring some cash as well. Situated in central Europe you can get there by car from Germany and Poland, or Austria from the south. There is an international airport for which most European airlines operate to and from the US you can go with Delta or American Airlines.

In full transparency, our Eastern European stint of Budapest — Vienna — Prague is starting to blur together. While each of these cities are of course different, there are a lot of commonalities in terms of architecture, cuisine, and atmosphere. We were in Budapest and Prague for just over a week each, with only three days in Vienna, but all three stops were also slightly limited by poor weather, travel fatigue, and/or illness making it fairly even across the board. We traveled between them by train which was efficient, comfortable, and a change from planes and cars. Overall, I think Prague was my favourite of these three, but by very slim margins. It had a great mix of everything you could want: it was lively, the architecture is unmatched, many buildings are actually original whereas several in the other cities were destroyed during wars and rebuilt in the same style. Many of the buildings here were also painted pastel colours making the neighborhoods feel unique and cheery.
Activity-wise, Prague (similarly to Budapest and Vienna), was filled with a lot of walking and exploring the area. We did two walking tours, and visited a museum, and aside from that our activities were wandering, eating, and people-watching — our favourites! We stayed in a hotel in Prague as well, which was a nice change from our Air BnBs. While very basic, we did have breakfast included. I did miss having a kitchen, but overall it was nice to be in comfy beds with daily room services.
Our first walking tour was an introduction to the city, winding through the Jewish quarter, crossing the Charles Bridge, and finishing at the Lennon Wall. While walking past one of the oldest synagogues in the city we learned the legend of Golem, a clay man brought to life by Rabbi Loew to help protect the Jewish people. The Rabbi would deactivate the Golem on Shabbat, however one week he forgot and the Golem got loose, leaving a path of destruction in his path. After this, the Rabbi never brought Golem to life again, and the form is said to still be locked in the attic of the old-new Synagogue. While this is the most famous Golem legend, he is not the first man of clay as this idea is reflected in stories and Jewish folklore prior to the 16th century. I find legends and folklore very interesting, and both Budapest and Prague offered nighttime ghost and legends tours that we had planned to take but were rained out which was disappointing.
Our tour also took us past the astronomical clock, a famous symbol of Prague. It is an intricate clock with multiple displays dictating the time, positions of the sun and moon, and Zodiac constellations. Given it’s age (built in the 15th century), it’s incredible how accurate it is. On the hour each hour is the worlds first puppet show, as a few of the figurines around the clock nod or make similar small movements, leading the square to be packed with people.
Charles Bridge was once the only bridge across the Vltava River, with construction starting in 1357 and ending in the early 15th century. As we crossed we heard buskers playing tunes and passed small stands selling jewelry and paintings.
After crossing the bridge we made our way to the Lennon Wall, named after Jon Lennon from the Beatles. John is not from the Czech Republic, nor did he live there, however when he was shot in New York in 1980, young Prague residents decided to draw on a wall in Prague as a memorial to the musician. Artistic and personal expression was not allowed under the communist regime in power at the time, and so by the next day the officials had painted over the drawings. The artists came back and painted again, only to have it painted over the next day. And so they painted on it again, and this cycle continued. It quickly evolved into a silent protest against communism. The wall still stands, and people continue to add their own artwork and words to it as it has become a symbol of freedom of speech and self-expression.
Our second walking tour was of Prague Castle, timed to see the changing of the guard. the rain held off for 90% of the three hours, and there were gorgeous views from the castle of the city below.
We also visited the Narodni Museum, which is a natural history museum founded in 1818. The exhibitions themselves are what you would expect from this sort of museum, nothing spectacular or unique, but for me the star of the show is the building itself. The detailed tiles and architecture were truly stunning.
We were overdue for a night out and decided to go on a pub crawl as Prague is known to have awesome nightlife that goes all night long. Overall, this was a fun night, but I would say it was not the best pub crawl we’ve gone on. It was a very large group, many coming together from a hostel where a lot of pre-drinking had clearly happened and also meant that it was quite a young crowd. The first couple of places we went to were fairly empty, but our group was large and the pubs were small so we filled them up and it was a fun time. This pub crawl justifies its price by providing a free drink at each stop (typical of European pub crawls), as well as free entry into the largest club in Prague. We went on a Thursday, which we thought would be fine given Prague’s reputation and that we’re entering peak tourism season. We were wrong. The final club was not only a twenty-minute walk from the last bar, but it also was completely empty. The club is five floors with different music on each, and it would take a lot of people to fill it up… but it was really disappointing, with maybe five people in each of the large spaces. We left almost as soon as we got there, waited for twenty minutes in the cold night for the tram which didn’t come (turns out we were on the wrong street), and wandered through the area until we picked up a free wifi network to call an Uber and make our way home. A bit of an unfortunate end, but a fun evening for the first 3–4 hours!
After about five days of amazing exploration and soaking in everything the city had to offer, I got my third cold of the trip. David and I both went to bed with throats that felt scratchy. In typical fashion, David’s immune system won and he woke up feeling ok, mine did not, and I woke up with a full-blown head cold and raw throat that stuck with me for several days, and now a week later is still clinging on with a hoarse cough in the evenings that I just can’t seem to kick. Our last couple of days were also pouring rain, so they were quiet days, we went out here and there, but mostly enjoyed the hotel and again took some recharge time before heading to our final destination of the entire trip: southern Portugal.

Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic with a long history as the central city of the region and the first capitol city of Bohemia. Bohemia dates back to 870 where by 1198 the Kingdom of Bohemia was established as part of the Holy Roman Empire. Prague has served as the center of life for the region through trade technology language and culture where much of the art and architecture over the centuries has been thoughtfully preserved. Prague suffered no major damage during the great wars except that many synagogues were robbed and their Jewish community targeted for deportation and execution by the Nazis during World War II.
On a recent visit to Prague my wife and I toured Old Town, the Jewish Quarter, Malá Strana, Prague Castle, and Wenceslas Square in New Town primarily on foot and with some assistance from the public tram system. One of the interesting and amazing discoveries on this visit were the Doors of Prague which I am sharing in this article.
Our room for the week was at the Grand Hotel Praha where we had this wonderful view of the Old Town Hall and the Astronomical Clock. The Old Town Hall building is primarily Gothic in design with some elements of Romanesque and other styles.
In addition to the main entrance there were these doors with a pointed arch of Gothic design a round arch of Romanesque design and a rectangular door with elaborate metalwork similar to that of the Romanesque door.
The interior featured many historical meeting rooms reflecting early forms of developing democracies, including the meeting hall for the people, a governing suite, and Senate chambers.
A unique feature of the Old City Hall and the Old Town area are the underground tunnels that connect the basements of many buildings in the area. The city was raised about 2 to 4 meters beginning in the 13th century to protect the city from flooding and to accommodate the construction of dams and locks on the Vitava River. So the original first floor of many buildings are now underground forming a network of connected basements.
Our first full day in Prague was spent exploring the Old Town Square and some of the surrounding streets to the North and East of the square. Old Town Square has a wide variety of beautiful entrance doors. These feature Romanesque designs with transom lights above the doors providing daylighting to the interior even when the doors are closed. Note the center door below featuring a door within a door.
These entrance doors with Baroque design influences feature bars and gates over the windows and doors with intricate design.
Saint Nicholas Church at Old Town Square features a Baroque architectural style with elaborate doors and this elegant window in the center below with intricate metalwork over the glass.
Art Nouveau influences were found too in these Romanesque entrance near Old Town Square with transom lights that have more free-form patterns integrated into the door designs.
Another elaborate gated entrance on Parízská street, and the blend of Gothic and Romanesque features in the Church of Our Lady at Tyn on Tynská street. These were found on our venture up to the Jewish Quarter and back where we toured the Spanish Synagogue completed in 1868 and its Museum on Jewish history and the holocaust.
Dozens of Jewish Synagogues were destroyed in Czechia and tens of thousands of its citizens were deported and murdered by the Nazis during World War II. Fortunately most of the Synagogues in Prague including the Spanish Synagogue we visited were not destroyed. An example of the architectural loss in other parts of the Czech Republic is this beautiful Baroque Synagogue at Holesov with Moorish design elements.
Holesov was designed by the architect Jakob Gartner and completed in 1893 with elaborate Baroque decorative features on the facade and in its doors and windows. It was burned down and demolished by the Nazis in 1941. An excellent display of the facts can be found at the Spanish Synagogue and Museum just minutes north of Old Town Square.
On our second day we ventured across the Vitava River to Petrin Tower, down to Malá Strana, and back across the Charles Bridge. We took a tram from Old Town to the base of Petrin Hill Park and then another tram up the hill to Petrin Tower. I highly recommend this route as the hill would have been quite a climb and the trams are free for seniors.
Along the way back we found this collection of entrance doors including Baroque style double doors with Moorish influences at the Strahov Monastery and Romanesque style facades at Mostecká street and near the Charles Bridge.
Crossing the Charles Bridge was special because you could see the many statues on the bridge and the spires all around in Old Town, Malá Strana, and the Prague Castle. Here is an interpretation of that experience from my wife Ana Mari.
As we wandered back to Old Town on Mariánské Námestí you can find these new glass doors with transom and side lights, the Art Nouveau facade of the New City Hall which is not that new since it was built in 1911, and around the corner on Linhartská street this gated entrance to the courtyard of a residential complex that can open wide for vehicular traffic or for pedestrians through the door within a door. It actually looked 21st century new.
In the rooms above many of these beautiful buildings are residential quarters. I noticed this early in the mornings when the locals were coming out and leaving for work, some slipping through their door within doors.
Venturing on, these entrances have Romanesque influences found on the doors at Lingartská and Karlova streets. Note again the door within a door in the center image below.
Continuing on Karlova street are more entrances with Baroque and Moorish influences. Note the doors on the right with the large stone bumpers at the base. These were common on many entrances and designed to protect the doors from carts moving in and out from the interior courtyards to the street. Many are still in place and some have been cut or chiseled back as the building use has changed over the years.
Our third day was spent at Prague Castle where we took another tram from Old Town to the top of the hill entering the castle complex from the North. You can walk west from Old Town to the east Castle entrance but it turns into quite a climb by the time you get to Saint Vitus Cathedral.
Saint Vitus Cathedral has Gothic style features as noted by the pointed arches on all of these doors. The front entrance doors have elaborate facades, an interior side door features a door within a door, and one of the back service doors features beautiful stone and metal work.
To the east of the cathedral is St. George’s Basilica which displays many Romanesque features with its doors sunk deep into the thick stone walls.
Our fourth day included an outing south to Wenceslas Square which led to these finds along the way. A Romanesque style door within a door, a Baroque style entrance with some Moorish influences, and an Art Nouveau styled entrance.
Approaching Wenceslas Square there is a transition from Old Town to New Town where here Romanesque influences can be seen in the entrances on Rytírská street and Wenceslas Square.
Our last day was a free day for wandering which included a round about route to the southeast to see the Franz Kafka Head by sculptor David Cerny. Along the way we made these discoveries on Jalovcová and Husova streets. Note the elaborate designs and textures and another door within a door.
At this entrance on Husova street below, note the door within a door to what looks like private residences on the two floors above. Most of the buildings in Old Town have been limited to about three floors in height except for those churches and public buildings with spires and towers.
In New Town and the Wenceslas Square area there is a change to building heights in the five to seven story range. New Town is what the Wenceslas Square area is called which is not that new given that many of the buildings date back to the early 1900s.
Along the way back we found these Baroque style influences on Národní and Michalská streets. Note here another door within a door leading to an interior courtyard.
In Closing I’ll share that we found time to relax on a few evenings, me with a good book, and my wife painting. We spent five full days in Prague walking several miles a day to tour Old Town and the surrounding areas. With a redeye flight on the way over we found that the jet-lag is real when it finally hit requiring about 10 hours sleep the first night and making up the rest with an extra hour or two a night through the week.
Prague is a beautiful and historic city and well worth exploring in person. If you have not been there then be sure to put it on your list of future adventures.

Traditional Czech food might be very meaty, but that doesn’t mean that vegans have it tough here. In fact, there are many vegan-friendly places in Prague that even my staunchest meat-eater friends can’t resist.
What are those? Here’s a local’s perspective on some of the plant-based food in Prague in 2025.
Whether you’re looking for Czech classics with a vegan twist, international cuisine, or budget-friendly options, this guide has you covered.
Eaternia is a popular vegan diner in Prague and genuinely one of my favorite places to eat ever. The first time I had their burger? I almost cried. That’s how good their food is! It’s been two years, but my sister and I still talk about that incredible culinary experience to this day.
Menu highlights: The burger menu, obviously. But they also always have traditional Czech desserts and cakes (all 100% vegan) that I would recommend trying.
Location: Prague 5 — Smíchov. About 7 minutes away from the Smíchov Train Station.
For the cool diner vibes, including a classic jukebox and funky wallpaper in the restrooms. And the burgers! Have I mentioned the burgers?
Střecha is the place for everyone and anyone wanting to experience traditional Czech food with a vegan twist. It’s a cooperative restaurant run by formerly homeless people and ex-convicts, supporting their reintegration into society.
Basically, if you eat here, you’ll get to:
Menu highlights: Svíčková, aka soy sirloin in creamy vegetable sauce with traditional Czech dumplings. Personally, I’m also a big fan of the Budvard goulash.
Location: Nové město. You can get here by metro (line B, station Národní třída) or tram (station Lazarská).
Střecha is affordable, welcoming, and one of the most famous vegan restaurants in Prague.
Safe Space Bookstore & Café is a relatively new spot in Prague (it only recently celebrated its first birthday), but it’s quickly become one of my favorites. This place is a unique vegan café and queer-friendly bookshop all in one.
There are always fun and inclusive events on, too, so if you’re looking for a quick vegan lunch, snack, or cocktail alongside some entertainment, why not check out Safe Space?
Menu highlights: Traditional Czech spreads and snacks, including the strange “Czech hot dog.”
Location: Žižkov. Get here by bus, tram, or walk from Florenc Bus Station (about 12 minutes).
If you’re looking for some LGBTQ+ friends or just want an affordable place that has both delicious food and interesting books for you to peruse, Safe Space is the spot for you.
If you like your dining on the bougier side, you have to go to Palo Verde. This Prague vegan bistro is perfect for fancy brunches and celebratory dinners. My sister took a group of her friends here for her birthday, and it was honestly the perfect spot for the occasion!
Menu highlights: Personally, I really enjoyed their kimchi omelette and have heard great things about the red pesto lasagna.
Location: Palo Verde is located in Nové Město, close to the Muzeum metro station (line C).
Cozy spot. Friendly staff. Fancy vibes. Also, they have board games you can borrow and play!
Let’s stick with the brunch theme! CHUTNEJ is a spot I kept getting recommended over and over again, until I finally gave in. And it’s a good thing that I did. This spot is amazing, and it’s no wonder it has such a great reputation among other Prague vegans.
It’s not just a brunch spot, either. You can get dinner here, too, as well as some delicious coffee.
Menu highlights: The above-pictured traditional Czech “loupák.” I used to eat these a lot as a kid, and it was amazing to see them again in a fully vegan café.
Location: Holešovice. Take the tram to Letenské náměstí.
The way people rave about this place, why would you not want to visit CHUTNEJ?
Imaginární zmrzlina is the only place that’s managed to get me excited about ice cream in recent years. And there’s a reason for that. This place genuinely has some of the best ice cream ever. Whether you’re a fan of traditional flavors or prefer more adventurous options, this tiny café has it all.
Menu highlights: The poppy ice cream. Just trust me on this.
Location: Karlín, near the Florenc bus and metro stations.
This is the best ice cream I’ve had in years. And I mean that.
Loving Hut isn’t exactly for those of you looking for a fine-dining experience, but it is a staple in Prague’s vegan restaurant scene. It’s an affordable vegan buffet chain that offers a variety of Asian-inspired dishes.
Here, you serve yourself. Just pick up a box or a plate and load it with whatever you fancy. You pay by weight here, which makes it perfect for those of you on a budget.
Menu highlights: Noodles, curries, dumplings, sushi, and more.
Location: There’s a bunch of these all over Prague, including Národní třída and Karlín.
If you’re on a budget or in a rush but still want to eat out, try one of these buffets!
Pastva is a small vegan restaurant in Prague that I can wholeheartedly recommend. I took my friend from the UK here, and we had some delicious “langoše” here (as pictured above). We were stuffed by the end of the meal, but I’m fully planning to come back and try some of their tasty-looking desserts.
Menu highlights: Langoš, which is a beloved dish in Czechia. Their risottos look incredible, too!
Location: Anděl, Prague 5. Close to the Anděl metro station (line B).
For the stylish atmosphere, comfort food, and craft cocktails, of course.
Similar to Loving Hut, Dhaba Beas is an affordable chain of vegetarian and vegan buffets that you can find all over Prague. Most of the meals are India-style, and while I wouldn’t exactly call them authentic, many of them really do hit the spot if you’re looking for someone quick and easy.
Menu highlights: They have these little soy pieces in peanut sauce that are to die for.
Location: Trust me, Dhaba Beas is everywhere. If you walk around Prague city center for 15 minutes, you’re bound to find at least one. But just in case, here’s a map of all the different locations.
It’s super affordable, and you pay per weight here, too, so there’s less danger of unnecessary food waste.
Last but not least, we have Linh’s Vegan Corner, a place that I just can’t resist. This Asian-style restaurant has a super comprehensive menu. As vegans, we’re often used to not having too many options. But not here. This place has a lot on offer, and it’s honestly a struggle to just pick one or two things each visit.
(Maybe that’s why I always end up ordering from this restaurant above most others.)
Menu highlights: I’m obsessed with the Black Magic Udon. Also, the traditional vegan honey cake here is a must!
Location: Vinohrady, aka one of the coolest parts of Prague.
Their Instagram says that this place is just like a fairy tale, and I have to agree. It’s that good.
Got some questions? Here are some answers.
A: Yes! As this guide shows, Prague has a blossoming vegan scene where you can find everything from casual buffets to cool brunch spots and bougie restaurants (perfect for those Instagram travel pics).
A: Go to Střecha for amazing vegan versions of Czech classic dishes like svíčková (sirloin with creamy sauce), bread and potato dumplings, and beer goulash.
A: Yes! Try Loving Hut and Dhaba Beas for quick vegan meals under €10.
A: Palo Verde and CHUTNEJ are definitely up there. Or, if you’re a member of the LGBTQ+ community (or an ally), head to Safe Space for books and brunch!
A: Definitely! Most of the popular, big grocery stores like Albert, Lidl, Billa, and Tesco have all you could possibly need, including plant-based milk, meat alternatives, tofu, tempeh, and vegan snacks. Albert has vegan pastries, too, which are great if you’re looking for a quick snack. Other than that, DM Drogerie is also a good place if you’re looking for some fancier vegan products.
A: No! Most restaurant staff in Prague’s vegan restaurants and cafés speak English. In fact, most Czechs speak English, especially those who live in Prague. They’ll probably be happy they get to practice their language skills with you.
Whether you’re looking for traditional Czech dishes or international cuisine, Prague has a ton of vegan options available to you. This list featured some of my and my friends’ favorite spots, but there are many more. So feel free to explore the city and enjoy the best of vegan food that Prague has to offer.
And please, do let me know if you try any of these spots — or if you have other favorites that I forgot to mention.

Immersed in history, overflowing with charm, and speckled with orange-topped roofs lies the city of Prague in the Czech Republic. Whether you love castles, architecture, or are just in need of a good beer, Czech Republic’s most popular city is one of the most interesting in Europe.
Prague has tonnes to offer with regards to culture, architecture, food, and drink; it has been on the tourist map for decades, and the crowds show no signs of dwindling down.
The Czech have a wonderful spirit. You really do get a feeling that they are not just putting up with all the tourists but instead embracing it, and want to show off their beautiful city. One of the most mind-blowing facts is their beer consumption; which may have something to do with their positivity. According to a local citizen there, the average Czech citizen consumes 300 litres of beer a year. They are serious about their beer and I am all for it! They know how to have and show you a good time. Prague is the perfect place to relax, explore, and get a feel for the history of Europe.

Now sit back and relax because it’s time to talk about more travel lessons from our first European Christmas! While not an official birthday trip, I have always wanted to experience Christmas in Europe, so as part of our post-pandemic family travel and to celebrate turning 40, we went to Europe with my brother and my parents for two weeks in December.
If you’ve read my entry about our trip with Sergio’s parents and sister to Paris and Rome, this blog is in a similar vein, with travel planning, tips, and reflections. Each trip is a little different, and the lessons are a little different as well — in this case, traveling in winter meant a little extra planning to stay warm and dry.
But let’s get into it! I can smell the mulled wine…
Sergio and I have long been shoulder-season people — a luxury to indulge in if you’re not a parent and thus married to a school holiday schedule — but we tend to split holidays between my family in Washington State and his family in Chihuahua, Mexico. Christmas tends to be family-centered because everyone is together and it’s easier to see everyone at once.
It’s not that I don’t like tradition — but Christmas is a special season, and I’ve wanted to experience it elsewhere (say, Hawai’i) for some time, but it just hadn’t panned out. Christmas in Europe, however, ended up being a (more immediate) family experience and it was fun to travel in the true off-season.
Depending on your family members, you might have a group of eager travel planning beavers or a low-key set of folks who are happy to travel to a variety of places. For my family, I’ve always found it useful to come with some ideas while putting their preferences in mind (eg; clean and quiet accommodations, easy to see sights, etc.). Europe is chock-full of Christmas markets, but Dresden was one that popped to the top of the list in my research, giving one point on the map and making it easier to choose the end-points on either side — Berlin, with which we had some familiarity, and Prague, which my brother knew. That helped us narrow down the list of possibilities and put together the main Prague-Dresden-Berlin itinerary.
I did a lot of the planning with some assumptions (many of the considerations about mobility, walking distances, etc. that I mentioned in my previous post), but I also had the good fortune to learn from our first family trip to Paris and Rome. The biggest difference between the two trips was that we saw virtually no American tourists in any of our cities in December. Really and truly, basically none save a few folks here and there. And maybe this was a pandemic hangover as well, but there weren’t a lot of tourists in general! There were only two sites that required tickets far in advance (more info later in the post) so it was a relief to be in a space that wasn’t nearly as crowded. It makes me curious what other European destinations would be great in the winter!
But back to the planning — I already wrote about creating a shared doc and a Google Map so anyone can participate. The most important thing I’ve learned? Taking a trip together doesn’t mean you have to do every activity together! It was something that I knew before, but to have a harmonious two weeks, it helps to have a lot of flexibility so that people can travel at their own pace as well as see those places that most interest them. Case-in-point: My dad had a minor foot injury that meant walking longer distances on back-to-back days was difficult, so that necessitated putting longer walking activities a day or two apart, or choosing activities that he wasn’t interested in during the afternoons when he was resting.
We chose hotels for our previous trip to Paris and Rome but decided on AirBnbs for this trip. Our options in these December cities were much, much better, and much more affordable, especially when we needed three bedrooms. It’s hard to find rental apartments with 4.98 stars, but we stayed in three of them and it was lovely. This put us in central neighborhoods with good public transit and access to sights, all super-important to reduce walking and increase accessibility. You probably have a preference for hotels or rentals, but I’d encourage you to look at both quickly because in some cities there’s a clear winner.
Now to packing — as much as I prefer to pack light, it’s a little bit more difficult when you’re traveling in December, and we knew we had to prepare for rain, snow, and wind. Another factor that tipped us towards apartments was that we were able to get two with laundry facilities, making it easier to pack fewer pairs of pants and shirts so that we could make room for snow boots (and souvenirs). The most important items were warm, waterproof shoes, wool socks, very warm jackets, warm gloves, hats, and a scarf. One positive about all of these destinations is that they’re not fancy cities (we’re not fancy people!) so a nice sweater or top with dark jeans was enough for any meal out. As a Seattle girl, I must tell you that your winter jacket is likely not warm enough (but if you’re from Minneapolis or Chicago, you’re probably prepared).
With everything packed it was just a manner of days before we boarded a plane in Seattle for our SEA-LHR-PRG journey! I tend to feel a little anxious before a big trip, but we had planned very well so sometimes you just have to let the butterflies flutter a bit and just do the damn thing.
So let’s start with our first stop, which was Prague! There’s something about Prague that makes it a perfect jet-lag city: The main attractions are in a rather compact area, there aren’t that many of them, and public transit links most of them togther. We chose a longer layover in LHR to allow for enough time to move throughout Terminal 5 with my parents (the right choice) so we landed in the Czech Republic in darkness, tried to stay awake in the cab for the ride to our apartment, and passed out as soon as heads hit pillows.
The castle complex was a perfect first-day activity — whether it was the tomb of Saint Wenceslaus (a duke, not a king as the song suggests) or the Old Royal Palace, we were greeted with beautiful views of the city and kept moving so as not to fall asleep. The views of the old city are beautiful, and depiste the cold there was a festive atmosphere.
For me, the highlight of the city was taking a Christmas Market walking tour with Jiří (George in English). He took us by tram to some local Christmas markets with a bunch of quirky stops along the way, including sparklers, writing wishes on dove-shaped papers in a cathedral, and drinking some sort of homemade Czech liquor. The introvert in me doesn’t gravitate towards these sorts of activities, but my biggest travel insight of 2023 was that these local experiences can really make a trip more memorable. Again, a huge benefit of traveling with different people is that you try activites that you otherwise might skip, and for some people those personal connections make the city come alive!
Prague isn’t a very heavy museum town — and I’m past the point of taking photos in most museums — but I can wholeheartedly recommend the Mucha Museum as well as the Museum of Communism. I could spend hours upon hours in a museum (see visiting four Smithsonians in two days in January), but smaller museums are more manageable and allow you to get a taste of something while balancing everyone’s interests.
Prague really was a short stop, but I felt like it was a city that was doable in a few days. We ended our last day with an incredible walk across the Charles Bridge with the castle shining on the hill above us. It was one wild train ride from Prague to our next stop — Dresden!
Dresden was the city I was most excited about for this trip, and it didn’t disappoint! Are you ready for the Christmas Market to end all Christmas markets? Well, we went to the main market in Dresden which was started in 1434 and it was it’s 589th year when we visited. It also has the world’s tallest Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramid, fondly called “The Twirly” in our house)! But beyond this, Dresden is a friendly and walkable city with easy-to-navigate public transit, and wind aplenty.
So let’s talk a minute about how to get around as an American — or non-German speaker. As with most places in Europe these days, English fluency is as high as it has ever been, and this is especially true in Germany. Like our trip to France, I was the only person who had any German language skills to use, but there were only a few situations where English alone wouldn’t suffice. The trickiest items tend to be ticket machines or menus, but with Google Translate you’ll get there. As always, hello, thank you, and please are good to know wherever you go (that’s Guten Tag, danke, and bitte, if you are wondering).
Dresden was firebombed at the end of the Second World War by the British and the Americans, destroying its inner city and burning alive about 25,000 inhabitants. The city center was largely recontructed in a traditional style (compared to a city like Frankfurt that re-built itself as a modern city), but the beautiful Parade of Nobles (below) survived because they were fired at a higher temperature than the incendiary bombs. It is a procession of famous local nobles from the twelfth to the first years of the twentieth centuries.
Unfortunately not all of the landmarks were so lucky, and because Dresden was part of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany, to Americans), many historical buildings remained ruins until German reunification in 1990. What was particularly inspiring was that the town’s citizens donated 92% of the funds needed to reconstruct the church in the style of the one that was destroyed.
Lastly, Dresden is also a museum city, but one that is still under construction. The Green Vault (no photos inside, sorry) was one of the two attractions this trip that needed an advanced reservation, and security was particularly tight because of a 2019 theft. But its jewelry, porcelain, and decorative collections were amazing — but, as in other museums, few benches are available, so consider your companions and give plenty of time for rest. The Zwinger complex (also under construction — it was a mud mess!) included one of the quirkier museums of the trip — a museum of math and physical instruments. How fantastic to see the evolution of the globe and microscope!
Before we go to Berlin, let’s take a short break to talk about one of my favorite parts of the trip — the food! I look forward to any trip to Germany to eat delicious bread and dumplings and any sort of meat I can imagine. But Berlin in particular is a fantastic food city — we had incredible vegan pastries, Persian food, a wide variety of pastries, and fantastic Thai food.
The food at the markets was just as good as I thought it would be. Since I’m currently not drinking to keep my autoimmune hepatitis in remission, I only partook in a few sips of Glühwein (literally “glow wine,” or mulled wine), but you can collect little mugs from each market to take home (or return it and get your Pfand — deposit — back). There was ample Wurst (sausage) and Knödel (dumplings), and a variety of sweet pastries, hot doughnuts, and desserts. Our last Christmas Market in Berlin had indoor tent seating — how lovely to sit on faux furs and eat dessert while the wind whips outside!
So the biggest oops! of this trip was renting the Mega Van in Dresden. If you know Sergio at all, you’ll know that he’s a fantastically-skilled driver, even when we visited England and he drove a mega-van on the opposite side of the car/road and parallel-parked in one go (might I say that I live my life very impressed at his skill in all things and sometimes very jealous because how can he do all this stuff so well?).
Barry and Sergio went to the airport in Dresden to pick up the Mega Van from Hertz — and as they left I felt really positive about it. I’m a big fan of train travel, but our ride from Prague to Dresden was pretty chaotic on the Prague side, and with larger bags and extra space, a car seemed like a great idea. We would have the car — with free street parking in Dresden and a garage space in Berlin — to enable some day trips and also make it easier to cart luggage. It felt like a great way to ensure more comfort and mobility for my parents too.
But.
… As soon as I saw the Mega Van I knew this wasn’t the right decision. First of all, Dresden was so easy to get around that we didn’t need the car. We did have a reserved garage space in Berlin, but after measuring the van dimensions and the garage dimensions there was no way it was going to fit. We agreed to eat the cost of it and return it so we wouldn’t have to move it around every eight hours on the street. But this albatross didn’t go easily! Navigating the van return to the nearby train station was the most stressful part of the whole trip — and when we got to the rental car return garage, I was literally outside of the Mega Van running alongside it to make sure that we didn’t burst a pipe or get stuck on the ceiling (it didn’t), but after that experience we agreed never again. Never. ever. again.
That being said, if we didn’t get the Mega Van, we wouldn’t have had our random drive from Dresden to Berlin with a stop at what we thought was a beautiful castle but was actually an exhibit on a very niche East German film called Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella — and if you think it’s weird, I can’t even start to convey how bizarre it is to be in an experience where everyone around you knows and loves a thing and it’s completely lost on you.
Well, at least the outside looked nice.
Did you know that this part of Germany is Luther country? It is — and Luther is a complicated guy (I‘d recommend Martin Luther, Renegade and Prophet to learn more about him) but despite the bitter cold Sergio and I decided to stick it out and take a train to Wittenberg (since the mega-van had been returned), so our first day in Berlin was actually spent in Wittenberg. Sergio and I started going to church just a few weeks earlier (worthy of another blog post, but not today) so it was also an opportunity for him to learn a bit more about Lutheranism, as he was raised Catholic.
Wittenberg was a perfect day trip! I imagine December had something to do with it, but we felt like we had the entire town to ourselves! The two main things to see in the town are the two churches — the Schlosskirche (Castle Church) and the Stadtkirche (Town Church) of Saint Mary’s. The former was attached to the university and both the location of the doors where the 99 theses were (supposedly) posted as well as the tomb of Martin Luther himself. Rick Steves had a fantastic walking tour for the city — he’s also Lutheran — that helped us to understand the meaning what started in this humble university town.
There isn’t that much else to do in the winter in Wittenberg, so we had a long, lazy lunch, perused the Christmas Market (which included an accordion choir concert!) and a nearby shopping mall, and then took a long walk back to the train station… for a train that was almost two hours delayed!
As I always say, never go anywhere without a book…
So despite all of the travel that we’ve done, I’m not sure that I’ve ever visited a place that I’d like to live in more than Berlin. And as I researched for this trip I was thrilled to discover that many sites and museums are open over the holiday, even on Christmas Day itself, making Berlin a wonderful place for Christmas.
It’s easy to be attached to your American view of Christmas — everything bedecked in lights and tinsel — but that might just be the United States being (yet again) a little extra. For example, Christmas trees are trimmed on Christmas Eve and there were no mall Santas to be found — though the Cathedral had a beautiful tree and manger scene. So if you can set aside Christmas expectations, December was a fantastic time to travel with many fewer tourists and attractions to oneself!
My favorite site this trip was the Reichstag Dome climb. The Reichstag is the home of the German Federal Parliament — the Bundestag — and the building it self is rich in history. It was burned to the ground in the 1930s and not reconstructed until the Berlin Wall fell. The modern dome sits atop a classical building, and within the dome itself you can see all the way to the parliament’s floor, symbolizing the belief that the people of Germany should know what’s happening in the government. A wide, gently-sloped ramp circles up and then down the outside of the dome, providing a sweeping view of the city… that would’ve been better in the daytime.
Since Berlin has so much history and character, it was hard to narrow down all of the sites to visit, but we really enjoyed the DDR Museum (compact and full of daily-life exhibits), the Berlin Wall Memorial (outside and included real parts of the Wall that were still standing), and, of course, Museum Island. While the Pergamon Museum is still closed for renovation (sob!), the Old and New National Galleries are spectactular.
We love you, Berlin. You make any trip a little bit sweeter!
Things are delayed even in Germany — in fact, during one train delay on our day trip to Wittenberg, the Germans were saying to one another, “This wouldn’t be happening if we were in Switzerland!” and for the two of you that think that’s funny, I hope we’re already friends.
We packed everything up, double-checked that we had our passports ready, set some early alarms, and made it out of the apartment by 7am… to find out that our flight from Berlin to London was cancelled en route. Poor Sergio was on the phone with British Airways and the calls kept dropping, so it took four or five calls before we were rebooked for the following day. There were a few hotels at the airport and we were able to get some rooms to make our airport experience the following day much easier.
I think everyone else was pretty tired by this point, which was a reminder that two weeks is a long trip from home when you’re not in your best travel shape. As a maximizer I want to fit the maximum days into a trip if I’ve flown to another continent, but two two-week trips showed me that perhaps it would be better to aim for 10–12 days abroad so we’re finishing on a high note!
Me being me I looked up some attractions that didn’t involve returning into Berlin proper, which included a WWII museum that focused on the Soviet experience (something you learn little about as an American ) — and then Sergio and I decided to get another long day of walking in at Tierpark Berlin, their “safari” park outside of the city center. We went to bed tired and happy, and the homeward journey went off without a hitch.
Well, we’re at the tail end of this post, so it’s time to wrap things up on this trip! Whether in this post or my previous entry about traveling with the Ricos, I hope you enjoyed tagging along with us and perhaps came away with a few travel ideas for yourself.
So what’s next? Let’s say I’m an antsy lady unless I’m dreaming of another trip. Since we’ve had some great road trip energy lately, we’re gearing up for potential road trips in Norway and France this year! No definite plans, but a lot of planning and excitement about our next trips to the Continent!
Auf Wiedersehen, S

Some cool historical stuff to know about Prague before you go
Defiant. Resilient. Betrayed. Those are the words that come to mind as I walk through the streets of Prague for the first time and learn about this historic city on the Vltava River.
It is hard not to experience Prague and feel the weight of history that bears down of the city and the Czech people, who over the course of the last nearly 700 years, have been ruled for a majority of that time by other states, nations and empires.
Prague got off to a really strong start in the 14th Century under King Charles IV, who strengthened the economy, started the first university in Central Europe and expanded the Prague Castle, including starting construction of St. Vitus Cathedral. He also commissioned the famous bridge across the Vltava, which was started on July 9, 1357, at 5:31 a.m. when he laid the first stone. This is well known because the date and time create a numerical palindrome (1–3–5–7–9–7–5–3–1), which meant something to Medieval numerologists, who must have been on to something because the original bridge is still standing strong, 668 years later.
Despite its promising start as the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Prague fell into the hands the Hapsburgs, when Ferdinand I was elected by the Bohemian nobility as king after their ruler, King…

A beautiful and unique city known for everything ranging from its rich history to its active nightlife, Prague is a gem in the heart of the Czech Republic that cannot be missed.
Located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, Prague has a beauty that can only be understood by traveling to the city itself. Before starting my trip to Europe, I asked the advice of several other travelers about which destinations they recommend that I travel to. High on the list of many of these travelers was Prague. With so many recommendations, I simply had to visit. But what makes this city such a favorite among both travelers and its inhabitants?
To start with, I found the people of the Czech Republic to be very kind to their visitors; they wanted to share the country that they love so much with anyone who is willing to take the time to visit.
As far as activities go, exploring Prague without a map was one of my favorite experiences in the city. The day I arrived, I decided to wander around in search of food. In the process, I was able to get a glimpse of some of the famous architecture around the city, as well as some of its most iconic sights. After returning to my hostel, I was able to do some research into the history of these locations while also planning out the places I wanted to spend more time with.
As far as specific attractions go, Prague is a perfect city to visit no matter your time frame. With that being said, a few of the most prominent and worthwhile attractions include the Charles Bridge, all of Old Town, Wenceslas Square, Petrin Hills, and Prague Castle. The main sights can be seen in a tour around the city in a day (which requires a ton of walking), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any more time there.
Now let’s pretend you have just arrived in Prague and you are eager to see everything you can in just one walking journey. Doing this, I would suggest starting in Wenceslas Square and walking down the slope towards Old Town. A walk through Old Town takes you through the picturesque streets of Prague, while also allowing you to visit the Astronomical Tower, the Old Town Square, and St. Nicolas’ Church; all of which are well worth it if you find yourself in Prague. After seeing these iconic sights, wandering towards the Jewish Quarter of the city provides an opportunity to learn some of the history of the city through the years. From there, walk towards the river to see the concert hall known as Rudolfinum while listening to music written by Czech composers that you might not recognize by name, but you will recognize by their music. Walk along the Vltava River towards the Charles Bridge where you should take your time to take in the atmosphere and the unique architecture of the bridge as well as the views of Old Town and Prague Castle as they face off across the river. This walk brings you to the other side of the river where you can see the somewhat surprising Lennon Wall as well as taking a trip to Prague Castle.
This walking trip provides an opportunity to see most major sights in Prague. Like with any city, it is possible to go into more detail if you so desire, and Prague is a city that deserves that extra attention.
There are museums and historical sites littered throughout the city, and they are not hard to find. I visited the National Technical Museum in a quieter part of the city and I was blown away by the size and level of detail that the museum provided. Anyone with enough interest could spend a full day exploring every detail. In addition to that, the Jewish museum in the Jewish Quarter is well known and has the reputation of being very good, but I did not have the time to visit it, unfortunately. The Prague Castle allows for entry that is free of charge, but a ticket is required to visit some parts of the complex. Purchase of this ticket depends on the level of detail you wish to go into, and the amount of time you have to spend there.
The activity that I highly recommend is taking a trip to the Petrin Hills where you can buy a ticket to ascend Petrin Tower where the views of the city are simply breathtaking.
These examples stand as just a few options for ideas on how to make your trip to Prague as complete as you can want. After taking a walk around the city to see all of the sights, taking the public transportation provides for a welcome rest from all of the walking. The transportation is cheap and cost is based on time which makes it perfect for travelers who want unlimited travel for just a few days. As far as additional public transportation goes, taxis can be found throughout the city, but be sure to find a good price. In many instances, getting an Uber will be far more convenient and allow for the best possible price.
The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and its capital city is the culmination of the country’s beauty. Prague is a city that should be on every traveler’s list for its uniqueness, its culture, and its people.

Cafe Louvre — The doors of the Café Louvre first opened in 1902. The restaurant still preserves the old café traditions. So even today you can still enjoy the unique atmosphere of a historical, grand café, as Franz Kafka, Albert Einstein or T. G. Masaryk knew it.
Everything on the menu is wonderful, and the outdoor seating is a magnificent welcome to Prague.
Walk across Charles Bridge over the Vltava River to find yourself in Malá Strana or the Lesser Town
But before you cross the bridge stop at GOOD FOOD, the holy grail of Trdelniks.
Climb up the Charles Bridge Lookout Tower for a view of both sides of the river before you walk to the other side.
Do the “hike” up to the Prague Castle. We skipped out on the tour, but the view from the very top is nothing short of incredible — great if you enjoy history and architecture!
Check out the Golden Lane, a narrow and scenic alleyway that used to house goldsmiths’ workshops. Painting a picture of the past, you see how people used to work and live as you enter the recreated workshops. Franz Kafka, the…

In the heart of Prague, a city steeped in the history of the Czech Republic and adorned with ancient architecture, my lens embarked on a journey through the juxtaposition of tradition and modernity. Arriving on a cold, foggy night, Tochukwu couldn’t help but worry about the weather’s impact on his photo walk. However, as dawn broke and the city emerged from the mist, he felt a surge of anticipation.
The grand doors of historic buildings greeted me, their intricate designs creating a breathtaking backdrop for my subjects. As Tochukwu roamed the streets, he encountered a young woman, her weary steps echoing against the ancient stones. Entering through the colossal doors, she became a silent storyteller, a fusion of fatigue and the timeless beauty of Prague. The echo was clear for many others that he saw passing the ancient streets of Prague, as the walls laid a perfect canvas for my imagination.
But the city was not frozen in time. Construction workers toiled, transforming the ancient into the modern. Amid the scaffolding, a mapping car glided through the streets, documenting the metamorphosis. The synergy of human effort and technological advancement was a captivating dance, a visual representation of Prague’s evolution.
As Tochukwu framed scenes of change, he couldn’t ignore the emergence of local delivery startups like Wolt, challenging the global dominance of giants like Uber Eats and Bolt. It seemed as though the city had its rhythm, a beat that the local players danced to, dominating the delivery scene while the international names loomed in the background.
Yet, amidst the transformations, Prague held steadfast to its traditions. A local Christmas market, set up by merchants near the city centre, breathed life into the streets. The aromas of festive delights mingled with the sounds of cheerful chatter, creating a timeless haven amid the bustling changes.
Prague also embraced alternative transport, with cyclists weaving through the cobbled streets. Although the city lacked dedicated lanes, it provided ample parking spaces for bicycles, promoting a green and sustainable mode of commuting. Each photograph of a bicycle parking space or a cyclist captured a moment and a testament to the city’s commitment to eco-friendly living.
Amidst it all, an old woman, framed against the grand doors, puffed on her cigarette. It is a seemingly mundane act, yet poignant against the backdrop of ancient structures. It spoke of continuity, a personal ritual unfazed by the changing tides of time.
And then there were the old trams—practical, reliable, and seemingly timeless. Moving people 24/7, these trams became the city's veins, circulating life through its historic arteries.
In one poignant frame, Tochukwu captured the essence of a young woman navigating the intricate tapestry of life in Prague. Her journey homeward was a visual symphony — headphones in place, encapsulating a world of personal melodies or knowledge development, and in her grasp, a pack of tissues, an unspoken emblem of responsibilities both personal and professional. The photograph silently whispered of the delicate balance she maintained, seamlessly weaving the threads of her personal aspirations with the demands of her professional endeavours.
Prague revealed its story in every photograph—one of contrasts, resilience, and the harmonious coexistence of the old and the new. As the shutter clicked, each frame became a chapter, a testament to the city’s dynamic spirit and the ever-unfolding narrative of its streets.

Ah Prague,
Forget Paris being the city of love. Prague, in my opinion, takes the prize! It’s one of the most well-preserved and beautiful cities in the world. I’ve had the pleasure of visiting several times and I never seem to get bored! There is always something new to discover or somewhere new to explore. Despite the cobblestones causing me to stumble every few steps or almost being hit by a tram, I have fallen in love with this charming medieval city.
Since my first trip there at sixteen, which was a bazillion years ago, I have been back 5 times. And no matter how many times I visit, I never seem to shake off the feeling that I am walking through a fairytale. I still haven’t found prince charming, but the hunt isn’t over!
Everything from the historical bridges to the hidden cobblestoned alleyways to the vibrant buildings, Prague really is a place that should be on everyone’s bucket list.
To inspire your inner wanderlust, and hopefully get you to start planning your trip to Prague, these are the things that made me fall in love with the city. If this list doesn’t convince you, I don’t know what will!
Walking through Prague feels like visiting a neverending history museum. It’s one of the very few European cities not destroyed by the World War II bombings, so most of the architectural beauty is original and more than eight centuries old. Each building has a distinct style and color, and to me, that is one of the things that makes this city so special. I love walking around and imagining who lived in them right after they were built or what they were used for.
A few of my favorite architectural gems are Charles Bridge, National Theater, and Municipal House. Prague is best explored by ditching the map and just getting lost. You never know what you might find.
Prague has a reputation for being one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and there is no better way to experience that beauty than from an elevated vantage point. There are so many places to get spectacular views, you really can’t go wrong. My personal favorite is the Letna Park Beer Garden. On a warm day, it’s the perfect spot to grab a cold beer and gaze out at the picturesque city below or better yet, watch the sunset. There is no better way to end your day.
One of my favorite aspects of Prague is the vibrancy. It’s a city with so much going on day in and day out and can be overwhelming to pick and choose where to go and what to do, but being in a city with too much choice has never been a bad thing in my book. Let’s just hope indecisiveness isn’t your weakness because then you might have a problem.
Prague’s mystery is one I have yet to crack, and I hope to keep it that way. With a history dating back over 2000 years and the fact that all the buildings are original and intact, makes it one of the most interesting, spellbinding and mysterious cities in Europe. I always seem to discover a new part of the city every time I visit.
These days, finding cheap destinations in Europe has become more difficult. Unfortunately, Prague isn’t as cheap as some of it’s Eastern European neighbors, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not one of the more affordable places to visit. You can easily find budget-friendly activities and restaurants scattered all over the city.
One of my favorite resources for finding budget-friendly things to do is Like a Local. Locals will give you tips on restaurants, attractions, shopping and nightlife and a lot of times they will recommend places that tourists don’t normally know about. You can save quite a bit of money if you are willing to venture out of the city center.
Smazeny Syr is a delicious traditional Czech food you can’t leave Prague without trying. This fried cheese dish is found pretty much everywhere from the simplest food cart to the classiest restaurant. Fast food places will usually serve it as a sandwich, which makes for a pretty amazing snack after a night out, but most commonly it is served on its own with a side salad or potatoes. Don’t order it on your first day because you might not want to try anything else.
Is there anything like watching a sunset after a busy day of sightseeing? I personally think it’s the best way to finish off a day. Ohhh, that rhymes! Prague has several vantage points where you can witness mother natures phenomenon. Many of the places will have cafes where you can grab a drink, find a seat as you watch the sun slowly sinking below the horizon.
A few of my favorite spots to watch the sunset are, Letna Park, Stefanikuv Most (a bridge with less foot traffic than Charles Bridge), Vyšehrad, and Prague Castle. Although watching the sunset with Prague Castle in the background is pretty incredible.

The Charles bridge is one of the busiest spots in Prague because of its beautiful gothic structure and central location. If you wanna avoid the crowds, head over later in the day as it gets dark. But if you’re looking for a souvenir or a performance make sure you get there before 4 to see the street performers work their magic or buy a painted picture of the city’s scenery. For the best views on the Charles Bridge, take in a sunset view or climb the tower at the foot of the bridge for just 100 Czech crowns (around 5 U.S. dollars) for some beautiful views at the top.
The Prague castle is one of the most visited spots in Prague and it boasts incredible architecture at the top of a hill offering spectacular views. Head there on a weekday for less crowds. If you’re traveling on a budget you can get inside the back area for free, or pay a small fee to get closer up to the front and see the whole thing. To avoid walking up the big hill, take the tram up the hill and walk back down for the beautiful views.
This monastery has been named the most beautiful library in the world. Go just two tram stops beyond the Prague Castle for a chance to see the beautiful painted ceilings. The monastery does have a charge to go inside, as well as a small fee to be able to take pictures of the inside. Also note that you cannot go fully inside the rooms but can get a view beyond a roped off area.
The dancing house is a marvel of Czech modern cubist architecture along the Vlatva river. Take a tour of the museum and gallery or ride the elevator to the top floor for a restaurant and outdoor deck. Just order a drink or some food and get access to the outdoor viewing area with a 360 view. Fun fact: you can see 9 different bridges in the distance from the top of Dancing House!
For one of the most iconic Prague sights, head to Old Town Square and the astronomical clock tower. A huge crowd gathers as the time reaches the hour and people wait for the clock to change. Get there 15–20 minutes early for the best views. The clock also has an inside museum that gives you its history and lets you see the other side of the characters that pop out of the clock.
Wenceslas Square has been called the Times Square of Prague. It’s just a short walk from Old Town and named after the Czech Saint Wenceslas. It has a combo of shops and restaurants, with several traditional Czech restaurants as well as street food. Right in the heart of Wenceslas Square is also a bustling nightlife with a variety of clubs and bars that stay open late and attract large crowds. You can also hope to catch an outdoor food festival, held seasonally and offering street food like sausages and hot wine and beer.

Vienna, Slovakia, Budapest and Prague are very common tourist stops in the central Europe vacation circuit. The architecture has similar trends (some cities survived the World Wars better than others), their history is tied together by royal families, common wars and the development of governments as they stand today.
We really enjoyed our guide and the history lesson she shared on our walking tour in Prague. She explained they had three massive invasions in the last few decades: first, by the Germans who stripped their culture and language and replaced it with German. Second by the Soviets who drew the iron curtain for many years. And then most recently by tourists… who have come to explore this relatively new country (it separated from Slovakia in 1993) and is still trying to solidify its routines for decades before.
We also learned a few shocking pieces of history… Prague is actually one of the best preserved cities in Europe. Why you ask? Because Hitler wanted to retire in Prague. So he didn’t bomb it.
It was only bombed twice: once by the Americans by mistake (funny right?), who thought they were bombing Dresden in Germany. Both cities are super close, and I guess they just made the mistake. And then by the Nazis, two days before the end of the war. But not much was destroyed.
Another one that is even more grim — Prague has the best preserved Jewish quarter in Europe. And that is because Hitler wanted to keep it as a museum of the extinct Jewish race. Yeah, pretty dark stuff.
Lots was absorbed here. We met some great people and hung out a few times during our stay as well as had the chance to watch the most crazy football match… England vs. Croatia with a bar that had hundreds of UK fans!! A few thousand people in a biergarden outside, mostly intoxicated. Whenever a team would score a goal, beers were flying in the air. Full beers, I should mention. A 0.5L beer in Prague costs about 2$, so people are not too careful when they challenge gravity with it. We went back home covered in ale.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
Sigmund Freud likes to hang around. 😉 Fun fact: this was a statue in memory of his crazy experiments, and caused a high call volume of 911 calls in the city as locals and tourists assumed it was a real person.
“Why don’t you Taj Mahal the shit out of it?” is what the Rolling Stones said when they decided to paid for the lights on the Prague Castle since at night in the 1990’s, since it had no lights on it until then.
The Summer Palace, and the astronomer who made discoveries from this location was killed by a blater infection… as he was too nervous to go to the bathroom and leave his meal with the king…
England vs. Croatia semi-final game at a beer garden in Prague. All I can say is that UK fans are crazy…and a few beer showers were had.

This blog post on urban land ownership in Prague is the 3rd article in the series. The collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB) resulted previously in mapping of Copenhagen and aims to continue its investigation further in Athens and Lisbon.
Through findings in this blog, we aim to question the importance of ownership data protection rules in the context of Europe’s rising costs of living crisis. The difficulty of access paralyses the research arena and informed public discourse on distribution of wealth and social responsibility (incl. involvement of journalists, academics, city administrations, etc.) further jeopardizing spatial justice. Ultimately, this hinders facilitation of adequate policy, law enforcement and action against exploitative practices such as property flipping, foreign investments, tax avoidance, money laundering and future responses to climate impacts.
Across Czechia, housing prices rose by more than 130% between 2015–2021 (Czech Statistical Office) and continue to do so. The average gross income, on the other hand, only grew by 40%. Today, an average Prague resident needs ca 14.3 average gross annual salaries to buy a 70 m2 new dwelling, making Prague one of the least affordable housing markets in the EU. These numbers are even more stark if net annual salaries are considered (see: Prices, Gross Incomes, Net Incomes) or if one looks at the actual current prices. Even when earning high salaries, Prague residents who do not own property have been priced out from access to housing, not to mention the more vulnerable groups.
Ownership mapping in Prague started with a conversation with the Cities for Rent: Investigating Corporate Landlords Across Europe project. This initiative, coordinated by the Arena for journalism in Europe, “marked the first step towards more cross-border collaborative research into the crisis of housing affordability and how it affects people’s lives”. Gaby Khazalová, winner of the European Press prize, investigated several issues including land ownership, data transparency, housing policy flaws, sale of municipal land or The hidden empire of the Tykač family which controls over ca 350 short-term rental apartments in the centre of Prague and has linkages with tax havens (Cyprus, Bahamas and the Panama papers case). In her article, the author rightly points out that while the majority of attention in housing crisis debates focuses on the lack of apartments on the market for purchase or rent, “what lies beneath” is the fundamental factor shaping our cities: i.e. land ownership. This hypothesis was also a starting point for the objectives of IHRB’s Building for Today and the future project.
In Prague, as in other cities, land ownership is foundational to this state of affairs, and issues around it guide the structure of this blog:
The State Administration of Surveying and Cadastre is the key source for Prague’s real estate data. The application makes it possible to obtain selected data on plots, buildings, units (apartments or non-residential premises) and building rights, registered in the real estate cadastre, as well as information on the status of proceedings for the purposes of registering ownership and other rights of authorised entities to real estate in Czechia, or for the purpose of confirming geometric plans.
Ownership data can be viewed for free plot by plot (CAPTCHA)
Viewing the real estate cadastre (CN) does not require any registration and is free. The application is intended exclusively for data viewing (plot by plot), as any acquisition or extraction of data by automated means is not allowed.
Core institutions have limited access
Our investigation revealed that the Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City Prague (IPR Praha) — Prague’s main policy-making unit for urban architecture, planning, development, design, and administration — as well as the City of Prague itself only has partial access to the cadastral registry of land ownership.
This is because the cadastre aims to disseminate data for smaller areas, a common demand. Public entities have the privilege of accessing cadastral data pertaining to their administrative area at no cost, but its use is limited to public administration purposes and cannot be redistributed to third parties (IPR).
All about money?
We were informed by the cadastre office that the range and condition for CN data provision are ruled by the Decree Nr 358/2013 Coll. Large quantities of data can be acquired, with pricing per plot ranging between 50 Kč to 100 Kč (2–4 euro depending on level of information provided). For a dataset covering the entire city of Prague, we were quoted a figure of 931 928 Kč (ca. 38.200 EUR), a figure prohibitive for this project, but also for many researchers, journalists, and the general public.
Prevention against automated data harvesting methods is in place
As the State Administration of Surveying and Cadastre prohibits any form of automated data scraping we chose not to engage with this method. We, however, performed a test to what extent such an option would be technically possible. Our test revealed that data is hard to access this way, but that it is possible to check plot ownership one by one through this website. Example:
After solving CAPTCHA which aims to prevent scraping, a list of owners should appear — in the example above we chose a site of Bubny Development.
We attempted to utilize the cadaster office’s API, developing a script with the Puppeteer JavaScript library. This script was designed to navigate the necessary webpage, complete the form, and interact with buttons. However, our progress was impeded once more due to the CAPTCHA. Even when attempting to use a headless browser to circumvent this challenge, the website failed to load without JavaScript enabled. In essence, it appears that intentional measures have been implemented to make accessing the data difficult.
With current machine learning methods, it is possible to overcome captcha, however, this method would enter clearly (dark) grey zone legal grounds.
Revealing Prague’s largest landowners is not an easy task. We leveraged a mix of GIS analysis, a manual check of the data register, literature review and interviews. As obtaining a whole data set for Prague is beyond the budget of the project, we were only able to scratch the surface and point to major actors in the city who are widely known to local researchers and journalists. This list includes the main developers of large-scale sites, particularly:
This map reveals further major urban developments.
Our investigation revealed that Prague’s largest type of landowners are:
This distribution shows that the City of Prague as well as the state still own substantial assets that, coupled with adequate policies, can be leveraged against the developments of the last decades which led to increasing unaffordability.
How much and what kind of land the city has with potential for the construction of residential housing is still not fully mapped. The contribution organization Pražská developerská společnost, which is supposed to register vacant city plots and plan their development, has a certain overview. According to its representative Martin Červinka, unlike many cities in the west, Prague has relatively enough land for the next few decades.
The Prague development company currently has land with the potential for the construction of six to eight thousand apartments. According to Červinka, however, it can be estimated that the city may still have land for approximately another ten to twelve thousand apartments.
— Denik Referendum, (Gaby Khazal — Urban Journalism Network)
→ Explore the data above in HERE
You can filter it based on the type of owner, plot size and land use type. Some of the most interesting compositions are e.g. plots larger than 5000 sqm & owned by “Remaining domestic legal entities” — this means companies. Several large parcels of land in this category are owned by real estate companies.
By hovering over a parcel you can then check who is the owner through this website (see also the Data Access and Methodology sections below).
The Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City of Prague (IPR) estimates that the city needs 9,000 new apartments per year to fill the housing gap and accommodate the growing urban population, while another estimation calls for 20,000 to return prices to reasonable levels. However, the lack of supply and increased demand only tell part of the story.
As cheap mortgages were available for years, housing became a popular investment product resulting, for example, in ca 220,000 investment flats in Prague, mostly in the historical centre. Furthermore, some of the following factors helped push homes out of reach for many:
These policies have reinforced the emerging global narrative which depicts city authorities as powerless in the face of developers, but this myth can be debunked through recognition of a new set of capabilities within administrations.
Municipalities can recognize the power of ownership data and its usage as tools for regaining agency in city development.
As European real estate prices keep rising under the prevailing economic, taxation and housing policy regimes, many urban problems call for reforms around land ownership, its leverage power, and data transparency at the EU, national and city levels.
Lack of easily accessible ownership datasets of land ownership, human-business networks and real estate transactions creates a condition where speculation can happen behind the scenes, away from the civic eyes and sense-making capabilities. In an attempt to protect individuals, GDPR data protection rules end up hiding exploitative behaviours, for example by making it impossible to reveal linkages to tax havens, uneven accumulation of wealth through the ownership multiple apartments or land sites, shell companies, and more. As a consequence, the right to land, and housing are further undermined.
Unfortunately, the European Court of Justice recently declared that the public access of registers containing information about beneficial owners of businesses breaches the right to privacy. Consequently, not just Luxembourg but also the Netherlands has restricted access to the registry of real owners following the verdict. This further sets a precedent for other member states despite having been highlighted by Denik Referendum, journalists and experts as a significant regression in endeavours to enhance transparency and uncover unjust financial transactions.
In the Prague context, wide transparency and ease of access for all to land, real estate ownership, transaction and business register data would entail:
Current land registry systems are predominantly centralized with data maintained by the govenrmnet or a central authority making the system vulnerable to corruption, hacking, fraud, registration gaps. An update through a transformation of land registry to a blockchain database could alter the data governance framework and render beneficial effects. While benefits and dangers should be taken into consideration this idea has already numerous examples in practice (initiatives undertaken by governments in Republic of Georgia, Sweden, Ukraine, as well as Ghana, Brazil, Honduras, India and Japan).
All of this could play a key role in improving housing affordability by unlocking:
In this context, the current continuation of the aforementioned Cities for Rent initiative — the Urban Journalism Network and its project Ground Control aims to gather investigative journalists from around Europe to address land ownership issues. These include, for now (links contain relevant articles) actors from:
Furthermore, the Institute of Human Rights and Business as well as Dark Matter Labs continue its missions around special justice and alternative modes of governance and ownership.
We hope that this growing network can not only spread awareness around issues of land ownership, spatial justice, and data transparency but also contribute to city, government and EU and policy change. Any kind of paradigm shift allowing for a halt to rising costs of living requires strengthening of these networks through collaboration, funding, increased capacities as well as engagement, creativity and recognition of agency by the city and state authorities.
First, through spatial data analysis process our team manged to obtain a map which allows for more targeted search via the Cadaster platform.

The first light of dawn slips through the curtains of our hotel room. I glance over at my girlfriend, already awake, her eyes tracing the soft glow filtering in. Neither of us know why we’re up so early. It’s not jet lag or the faint hum of the city outside. So maybe, it’s the anticipation of wanting to see a side of Prague that most visitors miss.
We step outside into the cool morning air. The cobblestones feel damp beneath our feet. Street lamps cast soft halos in the mist, and somewhere in the distance, a bird begins to sing. The city feels quiet, almost like it’s waiting for something to happen.
We turn the corner together and spot the Old Town Hall. Its underground played a pivotal role in the Prague Uprising against Nazism. Attached to it is the Astronomical Clock, a medieval wonder that shows the positions of the Sun, Moon, Earth, and Zodiac constellations.
Humanity has tried to measure time for millennia. From the Maya in Mesoamerica to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in the UK…

Going to Prague? Get ready for your Czech vacation with these tips.
Some of these things are common around Europe; some are specific to Prague. I’ve lived in Prague for over a year. Since I’ve only lived in Prague, I’ll just say you should know these for the Czech Republic, and I won’t speak for elsewhere.
Prague is separated into sections by numbers, which will often be referred to in addresses or directions. If you’re a visitor, you’ll most likely spend your time around Prague 1 and Prague 2, which host quintessential Prague sightseeing.
Most buildings addresses in the Czech Republic have two numbers. For example, my former apartment’s building number was 535/2. The building in this picture would have the number 800/50. Both these numbers will appear on placards outside each building, though sometimes only one number will be listed on an address. Knowing this may make navigating a little less confusing.
Going back to the example of my old apartment, the full address was Kubova 535/2. The street name, Kubova, is listed before the numbers, as is the norm with Czech address conventions. In the US, a street may be something like 123 Smith St. In the Czech Republic, that would look something like Smith 123/1.
Public transport is the best and cheapest way to get around Prague. While Prague is a very walkable city, knowing how to navigate its public transport is crucial. Let’s make sure you know how to do it.
To legally use public transport in the Czech Republic, you need to both buy and validate your ticket near the start of your journey. Purchase will always happen before entry. Validation will happen before entry for metro, and on entry for buses and trams. If you don’t understand, don’t worry. Everything is explained below.
First thing to know: all public transport tickets are the same for Prague’s metros, buses, and trams. You don’t need to buy separate tickets for each.
To purchase tickets, look for a ticket machine. Most ticket machines will look like this:
This older style of machine accepts:
They also have a newer style that looks like this, or a variation of this, but are much rarer:
This newer style of machine accepts:
To buy a ticket, hit the button next to the ticket you want, put your payment method in, and the ticket will subsequently be printed for you.
These ticket machines can be found in all metro stations and the airport. Frustratingly, most bus stops and tram stops don’t have them. If you can’t find a machine near a stop, look for the nearest tobacco shop, as they always carry tickets.
Tickets are separated by lengths of time and zones. For a regular tourist, as long as you’re staying within the main parts of Prague (which is almost everyone), you don’t need to worry about zone. Only pick a ticket based on how long you plan to spend traveling that day.
The most common ticket lengths are:
You can also text to purchase a ticket if you have a valid Czech phone number through O2, T-mobile, or Vodafone (local Czech carriers). If you want to use this method but don’t have a Prague phone plan, you can pick up a SIM card at almost any Czech corner store or phone carrier store. Note: please don’t buy a phone ticket until you need it as these tickets can’t be saved for later — they don’t require validation and are active immediately after confirmation of purchase.
Once you’ve successfully purchased your ticket, you’ll also have to validate the ticket.
To understand the difference between purchase and validation, first you have to recognize that Czech tickets are time-based, meaning you can buy a ticket that lasts for a specific amount of time, say 90 minutes. The purchase of the ticket gives you the right to ride for 90 minutes, during any 90-minutes. Validation indicates the start/end time of that 90-minute window.
Validation machines look like this:
To validate, insert the ticket into the slot indicated by the arrow on the validator. Push the ticket in until you feel a punch on the ticket. The punch will display the starting time and date for the validity of your ticket. You are authorized to ride from the time that you purchase + the duration of the ticket you bought.
Validators are found in the metro station, near the area where you enter the station. You must validate your ticket upon entry to the station; you cannot validate a ticket after you’ve boarded a train. Validators for trams and buses, however, are found inside the vehicles themselves. You can only validate tram and bus tickets after entry.
If you purchased your ticket via phone, you do not need to validate it. The timing for the phone ticket starts when you receive confirmation for your purchase. Because of this, make sure not to buy a phone ticket before you need it!
You have the right to ride the transport for the duration your ticket indicates starting from the time you validate. If you’ve already validated your paper ticket and are going to ride another leg of public transport while it’s still valid, you do not need to validate again (how many times did I just said valid?). You can also switch public transport types during this time, which means you can walk off the metro and onto a tram. As long as your ticket is valid, you don’t have to do anything during this switch.
Remember: a Czech public transport ticket is not valid unless it’s validated!
Please note you must buy a separate ticket for a large piece of luggage. To do this on a coin machine, press the discount ticket button (a separate button on the machine) before pressing the time duration you want. On the newer machines, discounted tickets should be an option you navigate to on the touch menu. This discounted ticket legally lets you carry the luggage on public transport.
These discounted fares can also be used on tickets for seniors, between 65–70 years old, and children aged 6–15. Riders older than 70 and riders younger than 6 do not have to pay fare.
A detailed breakdown of fares and costs can be found here.
In my research for this article, I stumbled across a Prague multi-day tourist pass that pre-pays for public transport and attractions. I haven’t used it, so I can’t vouch for its value, but I wanted to throw it out there as an FYI. More info here.
Fare is enforced inconsistently and randomly. If you’re entering the metro station or if you’re actively riding the tram or bus, you may be approached by a fare enforcer. These are uniformed transport employees (though sometimes they dress like a normal person to go undercover) who ask to see your public transport ticket. They will show a badge to identify themselves in all cases.
If your fare is valid, they will let you go. If it’s not, you will be charged 800 crowns (~$40). Fare will rarely be checked, but the fine is hefty if you get caught without it.
If you are caught without fare, you will get a written notice and will immediately pay the entirety of the fine.
In the US, public transport doors will usually open automatically at every stop or at the discretion of an operator. This is not the case in Europe. Many times, riders have to physically press a button to open public transport doors. If a train, tram, or bus has come to a complete stop and the doors aren’t opening, look for a button on or near the door to let yourself on.
If you’re using escalators to get on/off public transport, or literally anywhere else in Prague, always always always stand on the right side and make sure you’re not blocking the left side. Right is for standing, left is for walking. People will be sour if you don’t follow this norm and block the path.
Totally! And it’s actually pretty cheap. I’ve used it more times than I like to admit. Regardless, you can definitely use Uber here, but you’ll look like a tourist. There’s also an Uber competitor called Taxify that’s worth checking out if you’re into ridesharing.
Czechs can’t stand the sound of sniffling. People will get annoyed with you for sniffling in public. Instead, Czechs almost always carry around travel-sized tissue packets and constantly blow their noses. This brings me to my next point…
Literally everywhere. Sitting right next to you on the train? They’ll blow their noses. In conversation? They’ll blow their noses. While eating? They’ll blow their noses. Americans consider this pretty gross. It took me a while to get used to the constant nose blowing and seeming obliviousness to American norms around this. Now that I’m used to it, it makes hanging out with people while you’re suffering with a cold a lot more manageable, albeit still unsightly.
This one’s a little bit of a stereotype, but Czechs love wearing socks and sandals. I will admit that anecdotally, I’ve seen way more sock + sandal combinations here than anywhere else, and I studied engineering. Luckily, looks like it’s fashionable now?
You’ll see these all over Prague. Czechs love putting them on their backpacks and baby strollers. They’re *everywhere*.
You’ll also see these all over Prague. I have no idea why.
Czechs have a habit of staring intensely into each other’s eyes while toasting over drinks. It’s very disconcerting.
Americans think Europeans’ habit of a kiss on each cheek in greeting is invasive. Europeans, in turn, think pressing bodies against each other (aka hugging) in greeting is weird. Get used to lightly kissing people if you want to move here.
When Czechs enter or exit elevators or waiting rooms, they say hello and goodbye, respectively. For example, if you get called into the doctor’s office after sitting in the waiting room, you’re supposed to say a soft goodbye to the room. When you get on an elevator, you say hello to the other riders. It’s a really weird thing from an American standpoint, but here I’m pretty sure I come off very cold because I usually forget to do this.
Czechs do not wear shoes in their homes. Nearly every home or apartment will have an entryway in the beginning where you’re expected to take your shoes off. If you want to keep them on in the home for any reason, make sure to ask the host for permission first.
The Czech Republic’s national language is, well, Czech. It’s part of the Slavic language family and is similar to other languages you’re probably not super familiar with, like Polish and Slovak. To get a sense of what Czech sounds like, here’s a video of Let It Go in Czech.
In Prague, absolutely not. I know people who live here that have decided not to learn Czech; it’s that easy to get around with English. You’ll also find a lot of people who speak Russian and German. The options are (figuratively) endless.
If you leave Prague and head out to the countryside, though, be prepared to have a lot more trouble with the language barrier.
Hello: dobry denYes: anoNo: neThank you: dekuji (pronounced dee-yeh-koo-yee)Please: prosim
The Czech word for “yes” is ano, which often gets shortened to no. So in the Czech Republic, if someone says no, they might really mean yes. Be prepared to be confused.
Fakt jo in Czech, pronounced facked yo, sounds a lot like, well… you get it. In Czech it’s a phrase for “really?” So don’t worry, you’re not hearing Czechs yell expletives at each other, just asking for clarification. If you want to know when they’re swearing at each other, the word you’re listening for is prdel (pronounced pruh-dell).
As a courtesy, a lot of places will have menus in English. Those English menus, however, are often riddled with mistranslations. I’ve seen dishes that were supposed to be vegetarian come out with meat on them because the translation was wrong (something about mixing up the word peppers with peppered sausage). Below is an image of my personal favorite.
In English, if you want to offer someone a drink, you say “Would you like some tea?” In the Czech language, the same phrase is structured as “Wouldn’t you like some tea?”
When Czechs speak English, it’s common for them to say “don’t you want” instead of “do you want,” because that’s how it’s said in their native tongue. Knowing this fosters understanding, because getting asked a question the Czech way sounds imposing and rude to Americans. For me, it took a sec to recover from my doctor asking me “Didn’t you gain some weight?”
Though not formally an English-speaking city, Prague has lots of signs in English. They do write things slightly differently than we would, so here’s some phrases you should know:
Czechs use a denomination called a crown. At the time of this writing, 1 US dollar = ~20 crowns.
When given a number in crowns, the easiest way to roughly convert in your head is to move the decimal point to the left by one place, then divide by 2.
So if your bill is 350 crowns, moving the decimal place to the left by one place gives you 35, divide by 2 gives you 17.5. So 350 crowns = ~$17.50.
In the US, dates are written as MM/DD/YYYY. In other parts of the world, it’s normal to write DD/MM/YYYY. So if you see 08/12/2018, that’s December 8th in Europe, not August 12th. You’ve been warned.
In the US, we use periods to separate whole numbers from fractions of numbers. $5.10 means “five dollars and one-tenth of a dollar.” In Europe, they’d write the same number as 5,10 crowns.
For a larger number, we’d write something like $1,000.34. In Prague, they’ll use spaces instead of commas and commas instead of periods. So the same number on your bill at a restaurant may look like 1 000,34 crowns (that’s about $50).
Weirdly enough, they’ll sometimes write “cents” on a bill or transaction, even though the smallest monetary denomination Prague has is a 1 crown coin.
Get ready to think hard every time you have to use numbers.
In casual conversations, Czechs stick to the same time scale Americans do — saying a time between 1 and 12.
In more formal communications, however, times are often communicated using military time. If you make a dinner reservation, you can call and ask for seating at 20:00. A concert may start at 19:00. Your doctor appointment is at 13:45. Czechs do not use AM and PM. Get used to reading and understanding these numbers.
Americans count on their hands starting with the pointer finger as 1. Europeans use their thumbs as 1. This means that counting to 2 on your fingers looks like a peace sign in the US, but like a finger ‘L’ for Europeans.
Americans use quotation marks that look like “this.” Czechs use ones that look like „this.”
American phone numbers have 10 digits — like (012) 345–6789. Czech phones numbers have 9– for ex. 123 456 789. As a note, the Czech country code is +420, so your entire phone number may be +420 123 456 789.
Czechs and Americans have different keyboard layouts for typing. The biggest change is that Czechs and Americans switch the places of the y and z keys on their keyboards. If you use a public computer, be prepared for immense frustration. Muscle memory is real, folks.
Czech apartment buildings don’t leave building hallway lights on, as is common in the US. They also don’t typically use automatic sensors. Instead, Czech hallways are often lined with timed light switches that you press when you enter the building. They will also be placed on every floor in the building so you can hit them as you leave your apartment. After a few nights of blindly stumbling around dark stairwells, identifying the light switch is a godsend.
On a personal note, I was too afraid to touch these when I moved here, thinking they were someone’s doorbell or that I would flood the apartments with light. Learn from my mistakes — it’s okay to press them.
Similar to the light switches, some main building doors have physical buttons that you need to press to exit. If you find yourself stupidly shoving a stubborn door, take a step back and check for an exit switch next to it.
While smoke detectors are required in basically every building in the US, they are rarely required or enforced in Czech buildings. My apartment, for example, had no smoke alarms equipped. Know this beforehand as it can be scary if you’re expecting them and they’re not there.
In the Czech Republic, you don’t have to tip, but people usually do a little (This is not true if the receipt or server indicates service is not included. In that case, see my next paragraph). The typical rule is that you loosely round up. For example, if your meal was 136 crowns, round up to 150 when you pay. If you had really great service, a tip of up to 10% is standard. Paying just for the food is fine, however, as service is built into the price.
Though not common, some places will not include service in the bill. If this happens, the receipt will indicate it. This usually only occurs in tourist areas. At that point, paying 10% would be typical.
If you tip in cash, which is always preferred, it’s standard to give the tip to the service provider directly. Leaving the tip on the table is not common practice here.
If you tip by card, you have to tell them the amount before they swipe your card. You never specify a tip on a receipt. You will always pay meal and tip together in one transaction.
If you indicate you want to pay by card, the servers will bring out a card terminal to you. You’ll then pay by card at your table.
Alternatively, they may ask you to walk with them to a register where you pay. They will never take your card and walk off. As another quirk, when ready to pay, patrons will sometimes pre-emptively walk up to the cash registers, even in a sit-down place, and wait for a host or waiter to check them out. This is faster and expected, not rude or out of place.
Further, credit card technology is different in Europe. While chip payments are the new, gold standard in the US, Europe is one step ahead with contactless payments being the norm. These are payments powered by near-field communication chips, like the stuff used in Apple or Android pay on your phone. To pay with Czech bank cards, just tap your card near a terminal and your payment will be accepted. Since you probably don’t have a Czech bank card, all this means for you is that the waiters will often fumble around with a chip payment, not have a pen on them for signing a receipt, and will ask you if your card is contactless (it’s probably not). Hopefully knowing this will lend you some patience, help you not answer “huh?” to the contactless question, and make you wonder why American banks are so behind.
Of note also is that Europeans pay almost exclusively with debit cards; credit cards are not nearly as common, though establishments will still accept them.
If you pay in cash, waiters will usually also start and finish the transaction at your table. They’ll bring a large wallet filled with bills, at which point they’ll take your cash and give change at the table.
Europe does not always cater kindly to separate checks. In the Czech Republic, often they will ask what you had and do the math right in front of you on paper to separate a bill before asking each party to pay their portion. Splitting individual items is rarely possible. The wait staff may get salty if you try to ask for complicated bill splittings.
In the US, reservations are typically only made for fancy restaurants, crowded restaurants, for large parties, or for special occasions. If you show up without a reservation, you put your name on a list and wait until you get seated.
The Czech Republic is different. In the Czech Republic, even casual restaurants take reservations. Any place, casual or not, will almost certainly be full on Fridays or Saturdays, just like the US, but Czech restaurants won’t have a wait out the door. If you don’t have a reservation and they’re full, they’ll turn you away. Even seemingly empty restaurants will sometimes tell you they’re full, as a whole bunch of reservations are about to show up and the place is consistently booked throughout the evening.
If you want to have a place to eat, especially a good one, call ahead and make a reservation.
It’s common for Czech restaurants to have shared coat stands, like a coat rack or closet. When I dine with my European friends, they’ll often look for the coat rack and hang up their belongings next to strangers’ things. This is uncommon in the US where we just throw our coats behind our chairs. I tend not to participate as I’m slightly skeptical of leaving my belongings unattended and because I will forget my coat literally every time I eat.
To non-Americans, American service staff seem disingenuous, disconcertingly friendly, and over-attentive. This is because American staff aren’t paid a living wage and depend on tips for their salary. This crazy attentive service is necessary for wait staff to dream of maintaining a standard salary and is expected by American restaurant-goers.
In Europe, the pace of restaurants is slower. Waiters are paid a working wage and aren’t dependent on tips, however much they’re appreciated. If you want a waiter’s attention, you often have to catch their eye and wave them over, as they won’t be visiting at a regular pace. When you’re done with your meal, you again have to gesture for them; they won’t be looking to swing by as soon as you’re finished. To Americans, this wait service can seem apathetic and rude.
European waiters on the whole don’t have the sticky-sweet American demeanor, but Czechs take that to a whole new level. Czech wait staff are, on a good day, uninterested. On a bad day they are downright hostile.
Personally, the disengaged and often rude service staff in the Czech Republic are one of the reasons I don’t want to stay here long-term. I miss American friendliness, however shallow, like crazy.
If you’d like a take-out box after your meal, you will be charged a small fee for the box and bag.
If you pay with an American card, you’ll be prompted during purchase on if you’d like to pay in crowns or USD. The guidance I’ve heard is that you’ll usually get a better exchange rate if you pay in the local currency. I suggest that.
Don’t let this stock image fool you. On the whole, Czech food is very bland, with a heavy emphasis on carbs and meat. There are almost no fruits or vegetables in Czech specialties. Just a lot of meat, a lot of gravy, and a lot of bread.
Dumplings are everywhere in the Czech Republic, which I was super excited about when I moved here. Turns out, dumplings here aren’t like Asian dumplings or even Polish dumplings. They’re not steamed or fried, and they don’t have any filling. They’re basically just cylinders of white bread. #disappointed
Czechs love their pate (pronounced pah-tay), which is a raw, minced-beef dish, usually served as an appetizer. You’ll see this all over the place. I may have tried it once but honestly it puts me off a little, so I can’t speak much to its taste. I have had the salmon pate, however, and that was pretty good (in my head I convinced myself it was sushi).
Not specifically Czech but found everywhere. It’s chunks of beef and pork smothered in dark gravy.
They turn their goulash dish into a soup as well! Found on menus everywhere.
A mixture of a light broth, potatoes, onions, and… garlic.
Do you like mozzarella sticks? Then you’ll love the Czech main course of fried cheese. Hold the marina sauce, though. Czechs usually serve this with some variation of tartar sauce.
This dish has nothing to do with birds, but is yet another pork dish with dumplings and gravy.
Maybe because they’re so close to Germany, Czechs have pickled cabbage all over the menu. They have two kinds: a sweeter red variety and a more sour white cabbage.
Czechs’ own version of Cola! It can come in a variety of odd flavors too, for example, melon.
Yet another meat + gravy +dumplings dish. This one, however, comes with a twist. They serve it with a citrus slice on top (usually lemon or orange), and cover that citrus slice with cranberries and whipped cream. They also sometimes bake cranberries into the dumplings on this dish as well. I’m not a believer in combining sweet with meat dishes, so I find this dreadful. Worth a shot if you’re looking for a true Czech meal though.
Two quintessential beers to try in the Czech Republic. I’m not a beer person, so please take my advice here with a grain of salt.
Czechs love eating duck, so be prepared to see it on menus galore.
Czech open-faced sandwiches that come with a variety of toppings.
Not historically Czech but delicious nonetheless. This is a pastry, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. Dough is coated in a mixture of cinnamon, sugar, vanilla, and a bunch of other flavors, then slow roasted to perfection. You can also choose the filling of your choice — chocolate, nutella, vanilla custard, ice cream — and enjoy!
Lemonade is on Czech menus galore. That said, it’s not American lemonade. American lemonade is water, sugar, and lemon flavoring. Czech lemonade is carbonated water, and a light flavoring that needs to be specified and isn’t necessarily lemon. Think of it more like a light, flavored soda. Czech lemonades will often come in a long list of flavors. Some common ones are raspberry, cucumber, and ginger. Some places may even have lemonade on the menu but not lemon-flavored lemonade. Watch out!
I don’t know if this is a Czech thing or if I’ve just had bad luck, but the few times I’ve ordered milkshakes in the Czech Republic, they’ve been the temperature and consistency of chocolate milk. I don’t know if Czechs believe in putting ice cream in milkshakes. Beware.
If you decide to visit a McDonald’s here, note that there is no ranch dressing, and most of your beloved favorite sauces aren’t there, either. The sauce menu will be different, and so will the main courses. Some standards, like fries and nuggets, remain, but the Czech menu also includes localized items like a fried camembert sandwich (camembert is a popular cheese in the Czech Republic). European McDonald’s also tend to have a much richer dessert section, including pastries, like croissants. Visiting McDonald's in different parts of the world is a treat to see how the menu is localized. Czech McDonald’s official site and menu are here.
You often see this on the menu. This is just a European word for arugula.
In America, pepperoni is a thinly-sliced sausage. In Italy and other places in Europe, pepperoni pizza means a pizza covered in bell peppers. In the Czech Republic specifically, pepperoni can sometimes mean either one. If you’re going to order pepperoni pizza, be careful to clarify which one you’re getting. If, at a place you’re visiting, pepperoni means a pizza covered in bell peppers and you want the American pepperoni pizza, look for one that has salami.
If you see pancakes written on a menu, they actually mean what Americans think of as crepes. If you want real, IHOP-style pancakes, look for American pancakes, though they are not very common in Prague.
There’s a European law that what’s written on the menu is what you pay. This means that the written price already includes tax and tip, so there will be no surprises when you pay your bill.
Beer is literally cheaper than water in the Czech Republic, which is part of the reasons tourists love it here. Remember that water is almost never free in the Czech Republic.
While smoking hasn’t been common in US restaurants in decades, Czechs can still smoke while seated outside. Smoking inside of Czech restaurants was only abolished in the last few years, and some Czechs think even that is too strict.
Americans love ice water more than Europeans, but Czechs in particular don’t like any sort of cold drink. I’ve seen Cokes served warm, and waiters will almost never serve ice by default. As a non-beer drinker I’m not sure how the beer is served, but honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if it was warm.
For whatever reason, Czechs call potato wedges American potatoes.
In Europe, eating fries with ketchup is replaced by the default of eating fries with mayonnaise. Don’t ask me.
In the US, you either get a coke in a bottle (rare at a restaurant), or coke in a glass, but never both. In Prague, they always serve glass-bottle sodas alongside a glass. This is true for any soda and even water, which is almost never free and always comes in bottles.
This name means two different candies in the Czech Republic vs the US!
If you haven’t traveled abroad before, you should know that outlets look different in different parts of the world. You’ll need an international adapter for whatever country you’re going to, to make your plugs compatible with the other country’s wall outlets. If you’re traveling with friends, bring extras, because a lot of people don’t know this. Skyscanner has a great list of which adapters work in each country. Note that these most basic ones don’t convert anything electrically, they just make the outlet shapes physically compatible.
If you’re going to use anything that requires a lot of power from the wall, you’ll also need a converter, which converts European power output to something needier American electronics can handle. You’ll need this for things like hair dryers and hair straighteners.
This article is a handy guide for when to use adapters vs converters vs transformers (transformers are covered in an upcoming article, on what to know for moving to Prague).
For reference, Prague outlets look like this:
For any more information, the gold standard is the YouTube channel Honest Guide, an effort run by two local Czechs who go into detail about everything you need to know about Prague. This includes trustworthy places to exchange money, what Czech food is like, major attractions: everything. Czech 👏🏻 them 👏🏻 out 👏🏻.
Good luck with your Prague trip planning and enjoy your time in the beautiful Czech Republic!

My Guide in the Czech Republic (main part Prague)
In this article, I am going to answer the FAQ about Prague and give you some tips about the city.
I have been living in the city for 4 years and whenever I go for a walk in the old town, I feel like it is my first time visiting the city. That’s why I decided to work as a tour guide for a while. I don’t do it anymore, except private tours from time to time.
So, let Is go through the things that you want to know before coming to the Magical City.
*I will recommend videos to watch or website(s) to visit in each section, some of the videos may don’t have accurate information such as exchange rate but the information is useful no matter when you come to Prague ;)
The Czech Republic is not in the eurozone, the official currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech crown (Kč/ in English CZK). 1 euro is around 25CZK. You will find a link to the Czech National Bank and to a website with the best exchange point in Prague in the end of this section.
Coins: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 CZK * All the coins are useful (not the case with euros — 1cent, 2cent, 5cent) Banknotes: 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 CZK
*You should avoid the 2000 and 5000 banknotes for small purchases.
Although CZK is the official currency in the Czech Republic, you still can pay by Euro almost everywhere specially in Prague. However, you will not get the best exchange rate except in the international chains (supermarkets, coffee chains, fast-food chains, …).

Public transport is efficient in Prague in a way that you don’t need a rental car or taxis. Actually, it is cheaper and faster xD. There are 3 lines of Metro, 10s of tramways, and 100s of buses.
The tickets for a single trip are for 30 minutes (for 24czk) or 90 minutes (for 32czk). The daily ticket (24h) is for 110czk and if you are here for 3 days (72h) your ticket costs 310czk.
*If you are willing to stay more than 5 days, I recommend buying a monthly ticket for 570czk
For more details check these videos:

How to get from Prague’s airport to the city center (Honest Guide)
GOING TO PRAGUE BY TRAIN OR BUS (Honest Guide)
To find transport connection, check out this website (they have also mobile app) www.idos.cz
To rent bikes use Rekola, but you will need a credit card to use the app.
You can use Uber and yeah it is possible to pay by cash or taxi companies like Tick Tack, Nejlevnější Taxi or MODRÝ ANDĚL (if you went out with your car and end up drinking beers with your friends, they can give you a ride for you and your car xD at night).
*Ride for the airport to the city center should cost you around 500czk (20 euro), be careful from scams.
You have many options such as Hotels, Hostels, Airbnb, apartments, etc. I am going to describe the different areas by character so that it helps you choosing the right place.
Old town : you won’t need transportation since everything is close to you. However, a lot of going on around and there is a big possibility that you won’t have a calm night.
Lesser town (malá strana) : It is near the castle, Charles Bridge and many beautiful parks. You will need transportation and there are almost no supermarkets nearby (most of the prices are for tourists).
New Town : A great neighborhood, restaurants and cafés are excellent in the area. Most of your neighbors are tourists, those who hurry up are called the locals. You will need transportation and fortunately there are two metro stations in the area and many tramways pass by that zone.
The rest of the areas are cheaper, calmer (exception: Žižkov) and most of the residents are locals, so you won’t be scammed.
During my work as a tour guide, I met tens of people who planned their stay in Prague just one day or two days and double of that period in Budapest (sometimes more time for Bratislava than Prague :D). I think you know what I am going to say by now. Minimum days to spend in Prague should be 3 or 4 days. If you want to enjoy the city and yourself, one week to 10 days.
Plan A — 3 days:
You should not enter every monument/museum in your way. Consider taking transportation so that you won’t be tired by the end of the day.
Plan B — royal stay:
Life is good, you have enough time to visit the main monuments, party, enjoy the traditional Czech cuisine and save energy for the next city/country.
Plan Z — Underestimated city / just 1 night or even less
You can start by Prague Castle (don’t spend more than 60 -90 minutes in that area)than follow the Royal way (Coronation route). Next stop will be Charles Bridge that will lead you to the old Town Square. You should be tired by now from walking, so reward yourself by a hot coffee in Skautský Institut or another place (avoid the coffees in the square if you don’t want to be scammed) .
You should have enough time to enjoy a traditional dish. Later on, go to Wenceslas Square.
*This can be done the other way around (from Wenceslas Square to the Castle, but I recommend the first direction because Prague Castle in on the top of the Hill).
COOLEST DISTRICT in PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
1000czk without accommodation is fair enough. I will tell you why :
Transport: 110czk for 24h
Food: 600czk (150–200 per meal)
Coffee&cake: 150czk (coffee for 50czk, cake for 100czk)
The rest can be used for entrance to museum (sometimes it will cost you 250 czk, but generally around 150czk or less)
The list is so long, you should make your priorities. If you like museums, Prague offers museum for any kind of thing (Torture, toys, chocolate, Lego, Apple Inc.,). You love outdoors?.. well Prague offers that too, but if you can’t stand cold weather, you should visit the City during Spring or Summer Season.
The must visit list that I recommend is the following:
Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, Old Town Square, Prague Zoo, Wenceslas square, National museum, etc.
However, those are the typical ones, there are other monuments and places to visit. Check out the following videos:

The traditional Czech cuisine is so authentic. The food is heavy, tasty and not healthy :D Main ingredients are meat (mainly pork), potatoes, cabbage and flour. So, don’t expect salads or vegetarian food.
The best thing that you will enjoy, in the Czech Republic, are snacks and cakes.
I recommend reading this article:
https://www.tasteofprague.com/pragueblog/traditional-czech-food-in-prague-what-to-have-and-where-to-have-it
Here is also a playlist of videos from Honest Guide that I recommend to watch (included vegetarian restaurants):
Restaurants in Prague (Honest Guide)
Safety:
The City is safe and secure, but be careful in the crowded areas. There are no ghettos or not recommended areas. The Czech Republic is one of the safest countries in the world 😊.
Halal food:
There are some restaurants that offer halal food. Most of them are near to the city center. Here is a list of the restaurants, I will try to cover all the areas in Prague:
Mangal Restaurant is located in the Wenceslas square. Address: Václavské náměstí 64, Praha
Barakat is near the mosque of the center. Address: Opletalova 28, Praha
Istanbul Kebab is also near the mosque of the center, less than 100 meters from Barakat. Address: Politických vězňů, 17, Praha
Jordan Restaurant in the lesser town (mala strana). So, if you are hungry and you still near the castle this should be your destination. Address: Malostranské náměstí 36/22, Praha
Safír is a good Lebanese restaurant. You can find it in different malls (OC Nový Smíchov, Arkády Pankrác, OC DBK — Budějovická , OC Chodov) * OC stands for Commercial Center. Here is their website http://www.isafir.cz , but it is not updated.
*if you are so into halal things, you should go 100% vegan in this country or buy expensive food from bio supermarkets/restaurants.
Different products use pork gelatin or other extracted products from pork. These products can be yogurt, sweet bakery (even croissant), etc.
If you want to have bolognaise or burger with mashed beef meat, make sure that is not mixed with pork (in non halal places).
Mosques:
Mosque of the center: Opletalova 930/28, 110 00 Praha 1 (be advised, it is located inside a building)
Mosque Alfirdaus : Na Košince 502/1, 180 00 Praha 8-Libeň
Mosque of Černý Most: Blatská 1491, 198 00 Praha 9
Other tips:
Keep in mind that the Czech Republic is in the CENTER of Europe and not in the East. Also avoid saying Czechia, no one like it.
Here are playlists (if you don’t want to watch all of them, I selected some videos from the playlist. You will find them below the playlists)

I suspect that on a clear day, when seen from the moon, Prague glitters like a sparkler. It seems like every Old-World store window gleams with crystal: bowls, bottles, bells, boxes, baskets, trays, vases, ladles, plates, jugs, wine glasses, brandy snifters, beer steins, cups and saucers, napkin holders, atomizers, and assorted tchotchkes.
All that glitter sparked an idea: Buy a chandelier.
Did it matter that all I had to carry souvenirs in was a daypack? That crystal chandeliers are made of hundreds of pieces of fragile and weighty glass? That I was already carrying 18 traditional, hand-painted, blown Czech Easter eggs?
No, it didn’t matter because my husband and I had just bought a charming Victorian house in San Francisco. The showpiece dining room featured a 10-foot-high ceiling, embossed wainscoting, a bay window, a built-in Victorian hutch, an antique dining table, and, suspended down from the flowery ceiling-rose disk in the middle of the dining room: an out-of-place, two-foot-diameter, Japanese paper lantern that looked like a glowing, white beach ball.
We needed a crystal chandelier.
But we were house-poor.
At home I had checked big-box stores and boutique lighting “shoppes,” but no chandeliers were less than $1,000, way out of our range.
Now I wandered in Prague, the Crystal Capital of the World.
My three-day trip was a personal reward after a rough week on a writing assignment in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Blocky, gray, Soviet-era architecture matched blocky, gray sky and overwhelmed the tiny historic quarter. I needed picturesqueness. I needed pizzazz. I needed Prague.
Staromestské námestí — Prague’s medieval-to-Renaissance Old Town Square — featured warm yellow, pastel blue, and soft peach baroque buildings with flat facades, pointed tops, and curving lines set in restful balance. Soulful violins and upbeat guitars from the lively music scene sent their melodies through the narrow alleys. Aromas of chicken paprikash, potato dumplings, and garlic soup from cafés and home kitchens comforted me.
Of course, I couldn’t possibly buy a chandelier. It was ridiculous enough that I imagined I could safely carry a dozen and a half hollowed eggs back to California, but their rich red and yellow colors, complex geometric patterns, and symbolism of protection seduced me.
In a shop up the hill toward Prazsky hrad — Prague Castle — crystal seduced me, too. I saw a chandelier for US$250 — including sea-mail shipping. For a day I agonized about the money, but the fact that it could be shipped — for free — finally won me over. Late in the afternoon I was leaving Prague, I made the commitment and returned to buy it.
A different clerk was on duty.
“Oh, no, we cannot possibly ship this sea-mail. This must go airmail,” he said. “That will cost $100 more.”
In the rapid switch to capitalism, the Czechs were clicking — but this development moved my chandelier out of reach.
Deeply saddened, I hurried down the hill because I needed to take the subway soon to catch the bus to the airport for the last flight to Bratislava. Across the Karluv most or Charles Bridge, which spans the River Vltava, I passed another lighting store.
A chandelier hanging in the window was perfect: hundreds of delicate crystals draped in rows — not ostentatious, not gaudy. It was 4,440 koruna or about US$185. Even adding air-mail costs it was acceptable.
I went inside. The middle-aged saleswoman spoke no English and I no Czech so we muddled through with my pathetic German and gestures.
She had no more chandeliers of that model. Could I have the one in the window? Yes. She was so kind. We took it down together. She found a battered, yellow, cardboard box — three feet square by two feet high. We stuffed it with newspaper and tied it with many swirls of string.
What were the costs for shipping? No shipping. No shipping? I would have to carry it.
I dashed to the money changer, checked my watch, waited in line, checked my watch again, and told the clerk how many koruna I needed. He told me how much that would be in U.S. travelers’ checks.
I got the cash, dashed back to the store — and the saleswoman pointed out that I was short by a few koruna.
Time was getting very tight now. I was glad I had already bought my subway pass.
I ran back to the money changer and explained the situation. He said, “Oh, I did not realize you needed exact amount for purchase.” I gave him another travelers’ check, he gave me more koruna, and I flew back to the store. Transaction finally complete, I checked my watch, waved a “Thank you!” and skedaddled.
Carrying my daypack with the blown eggs and struggling with the awkward box and its heavy glass contents, I waddled around the corner to the subway station. I had seen the station many times so was comfortable that all would work out now.
Down the steps I wobbled. Stairs to the lower level were boarded up. I traipsed around in search of others. No luck. The cavernous station held delis and clothing stores, but no information booth. My heart rate increased, and sweaty palms made it harder to grip the clumsy box.
I lumbered to a magazine stand. I couldn’t afford to wait in the long line. “Bitte, wo sind die Zuge?” I shouted in German. “Please, where are the trains?”
“Geschlossen,” said the harried clerk without looking my way.
“Geschlossen?” I said. “Closed? You can’t ‘close’ a train! I have to get to the bus for the airport!” You could take a train out of service, but this was a perfectly fine, obviously functioning subway station so you couldn’t just “close” a train.
“The station is closed,” said a tall, thin, dark-haired Czech man in his mid-30s standing next to me. The white plastic bag of vegetables he carried contrasted with his brown business suit. “The nearest station is . . . “ and then he said something like “up, left, right, street, around, under, right, blocks, down.”
Hyperventilation befuddled my brain. I stared at him.
He took the scruffy box and handed me the bag of vegetables. We hoofed up the stairs and dashed for several blocks through the streets of Prague, twisting left, turning right, ducking through breezeways, and finally ending up at the entrance to another subway station.
My benefactor then took his vegetables, handed me the box, and said something like “in, right, up, along, left, over, behind, across, right.”
Again, I stared at him.
Again, he grabbed the box, gave me the veggies, led me through the dark subway maze, and deposited me on a platform. He pointed in the direction the train would go. He placed the box on the platform, and I handed him his vegetables. I bubbled over with “thank you” and “danke schon” and “být zavázán tebe,” and he laughed as I got on the train.
So I made the bus and caught the flight but had to check the chandelier like a suitcase. The next morning before dawn I took another bus to Vienna and again had to check the chandelier as luggage on the flight home. I changed planes in New York; and when I arrived in San Francisco, the box was there — a little battered, but upright and more-or-less the same size.
I opened it and checked the 1,392 crystals. Only one had broken. All 18 of the eggs survived, too.
The chandelier shone beautifully in our Victorian dining room. When we moved nine years later, we took it with us — I couldn’t bear to leave it and all it represented.
As valuable and delicate as a crystal chandelier is, the more worthy — and fragile — factor is the kindness of human beings, and the memory I treasure most is of the smiling face and shining heart of the handsome Czech man with his suit and vegetables.

Prague is pretty, I’ll give you that. I have some fond memories from my first visit in 2011. I swear it wasn’t such a tourist hotspot 13 years ago but maybe it was and I was so enchanted by its architecture I didn’t notice the crowds.
Our group was royally ripped off by taxis as soon as we arrived at the station. We didn’t have time to do the currency conversions. We had booked an apartment close to the station, not realising Prague, like many other European cities, had more than one train station and our accommodation happened to be close to the other station.
medium.com
The more you travel, the more you learn. That first experience left a bad taste in our mouths. The taxi fares had used all of our allotted spending money for Prague so we had to cut back. No dining out for us so we ordered a pizza and calzone takeaway. It turned out the taxi debacle was a commonplace occurrence in Prague as in other cities. But we were inexperienced travellers and always booked accommodation within walking distance of the station. Except in Prague.

Prague is a beautiful city. The river flows through the heart of it with the Disney-looking castle perched atop a hillside in the background. Its baroque and romanesque architecture give it an air of elegance that is incredibly unique.
The Old Town Square is the main area boasting beautiful buildings and the famous Orloj, an astronomical clock that sings at the top of every hour. It was teeming with tourists, so we didn’t stay too long in that area. And, unfortunately similar to Amsterdam, many of the streets were overflowing with trash and graffitied walls, which degraded the beauty of the city. In addition, overwhelming crowds and poor weather influenced our perception of Prague. It was obscenely hot the first few days, which gave us limited time to prance about before the sun scorched down on us and we had to take refuge inside shady cafes. But, the last few days cooled off and it even started raining out of the blue so we had to take cover again.
Despite an abundance of tourists and hot weather, we found that the best way to enjoy ourselves was by venturing out of the main town squares and finding solace along the side streets. Wandering along Old Town’s cobblestone streets was a great way to spend our time because we felt like this was more of an ideal way to experience this archetypal European city. I also had a chance to discover a specialty of Czech desserts: the trdelník chimney. It’s a funnel-cake filled with soft-serve ice cream and smells like a cinnamon roll. You can often find bakers on the streets baking the dough on a rotating spit then rolling it in cinnamon and sugar before filling it up with soft-serve. It was delicious confection for any sweet-tooth to enjoy!
In Vrtba garden, I got to see a photoshoot with a fashion model walking throughout the grounds. And I followed in her footsteps popping some poses myself.
We also got a great view walking up the steps of the Italian-style gardens and seeing the city beyond them. But, the best sights (and sounds) were yet to come…
The walk to Prague Castle was one of our favorite parts of the city. First, we started the walk from the Powder Tower, then up and over Charles Bridge. Charles Bridge is an attraction all by itself. Built in the 14th century, it’s lined with: sculptures of religious images and prolific Czech figures, street performers, artists and peddlers. It provides some of the most scenic views of the city over the Vltava River.
After crossing the bridge, we wound through cobblestone lanes and then climbed 200+ steps up to the castle entrance. Though the hike up to the castle is a bit of a workout, it’s worth it to get a spectacular view of Prague. In particular, the view at the top from the Starbucks (yep, you read that correctly; they pick the best locations!) situated in an outdoor patio setting overlooking the city was incomparable.
Once we arrived at Prague Castle, there’s no shortage of things to do. The compound includes a pretty expansive collection of eclectic buildings with museums, cafes, and archways connected by the internal castle roads. It’s a self-sufficient city unto itself similar to Windsor Castle. And, after the trek uphill we found a nice little offshoot area next to a cafe where we could sit, listen to a fountain, and cool off.
One of the best things we did was attend an organ concert in St. Vitus Cathedral, in the heart of the castle complex. St. Vitus is a 14th century Gothic church housing the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors. It’s also the home to a great organ that’s about 3 stories tall! We got to hear the prodigious instrument in all of its glory at a special evening concert. The booming sound of the pipes reverberated through the gothic arches making the church come alive! I can only imagine how awesome it must have been to the Bohemians back in the day when this baby was first installed. The event was unbelievably special, and I savored the moment listening to the sweet tempo and the rich tones of the organ. It has inspired me to start tickling the ivories once again!

I’ve lived in Prague for 25 years, and I get asked pretty frequently about good things to do, so I figured I’d put it into a list.
In terms of events calendars, I’d check the Expats.cz (www.expats.cz) calendar, the Prague TV (www.prague.tv) calendar, and the Czech Tourism site (which is good, but kinda basic — http://www.czechtourism.com/home/).
Here’s something you might not know: Vietnamese culture is strong in Prague. Vietnamese are the third-largest ethnic minority in the Czech Republic (behind Slovaks and Ukrainians), and there are a number of places to get great Vietnamese food, including the sprawling SAPA marketplace (Anthony Bourdain visited there when he came to Prague a couple of years ago). SAPA is like a huge swap meet. It’s kind of hard to get to, but a really unexpected thing to find in Prague. (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/wKypyCh5AW32)
Barring that, I’d recommend visiting Banh Mi Makers on Dlouhá třida in the Old Town for a great Banh Mi sandwich. In fact, the building that houses Banh Mi Makers is a gourmet shopping center that also hosts one of the must-visit restaurants in town, the stand-up Naše Maso butcher shop Map: https://goo.gl/maps/XacKM4neyct. If you have enough lead time, I highly recommend reserving their ‘Noc s řezníkem (Night With A Butcher)’ an absolutely massive six-course
Just down Dlouhá, you have Lokal, which is a retro-style pub that serves some of the freshest Pilsner Urquell outside of Pilsen. And next door you have the Roxy and NoD spaces, which are great for catching a DJ gig or maybe a performance (check the website at www.roxy.cz).
In terms of vegetarian fare, I like the Maitrea restaurant near the Old Town Square, and Radost FX Cafe, and I highly recommend the Eska restaurant in the up and coming Karlin neighborhood. It just got a Michelin Bib Gourmand, and while it isn’t a strictly vegan restaurant, it’s a place that focuses on bread and things made with yeast or fermentation. It’s excellent.
One place that’s kinda touristy but still excellent is the rooftop bar at the Hotel U Prince, just off the Old Town Square. Walk into the hotel, all the way to the back, and you’ll find a glass elevator. Take that to the top and walk up some stairs, and you’ll be rewarded with one of the most spectacular views of the city you could ever imagine. And it’s even heated in the winter. https://www.terasauprince.com/terrace
The Maurer Grand Restaurant list (and app) has a ton of great restaurant recommendations too. http://www.grandrestaurant.cz/home/?lng=en
Prague has some great design shops if you know where to look. I especially like Tuzeks (http://tuzeks.eu/), which is a play on words on the old Communist hard-currency shops. Tuzeks sells retro Czech design (the lamps and chairs are great). https://goo.gl/maps/L7u5hKYkTG62
In the last couple of years we’ve seen a lot of design stores open up, and one of my favorites is the Chemistry Design Store (https://www.facebook.com/thechemistrydesignstore/), which has a lot of funky prints, glasswork, and some of the coolest turntables I’ve ever seen (made by 440 Audio — http://www.440audio.eu/). I also love the Modernista store in several locations, including the House of the Black Madonna. They specialize in faithful reproductions of Czech art deco, cubist and modernist pieces, and they’re gorgeous. http://www.modernista.cz/?lang=en
The Museum of Decorative Arts is also off the beaten path and is excellent, and has a wonderful museum shop, also run by Modernista (https://goo.gl/maps/1WdovwAG1Ro). Bonus: The windows, especially the ones in the stairways, overlook the Jewish Cemetery. I’m of two minds on whether the cemetery itself is worth going to. It’s usually mobbed, and it’s pretty pricey to get in. But the synagogues are beautiful. I’d instead recommend the small Jewish cemetery under the Zizkov TV tower. While there, you can check out the bar up on top of the TV tower, as well as checking out the Palac Akropolis, still my favorite concert venue in town, with two separate DJ bars.
I also like the scruffy Žižkov neighborhood where the Akropolis is located, which, pound for pound, has the highest concentration of bars, restaurants and cafes in town. That and the more upscale Vinohrady neighborhood next to it are good.
Being an old fart, I don’t get out as much as I’d like to. But when I do, I like the Naplavka riverwalk (https://goo.gl/maps/66HK8PEoGEH2) and the Krymska street neighborhood (https://goo.gl/maps/3PfbNjZEM5r). Naplavka is not so great in the wintertime, but is the place to be in spring and summer. And Krymska is ground zero for Prague hipsters. Pretty great.
Clubwise, some of Prague’s must-visit places include the Palac Akropolis (www.akropolis.cz), Roxy, Rock Cafe, Radost FX, and definitely the Cross Club, which must be seen to be believed — Atlas Obscura has a nice writeup here: http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-club
I live close to the up-and-coming Letna neighborhood, which is anchored by the Bio Oko arthouse cinema and cafe (https://goo.gl/maps/rLkuMmDs9YF2). That neighborhood has the National Technical Museum, a must-see for geeks (https://goo.gl/maps/a9h6YqqUp6v) and Letna Park’s beer garden (https://goo.gl/maps/Dqvzyh8HNEs), which has one of the best views in town. In between are all kinds of great cafes and bars.
I’d strongly recommend getting a metro pass for the time you’re here. It’s cheap and so much less hassle. I’d also recommend (if you have mobile data) the Google Maps app, which also gives you timetables and nearest transit stops.
Prague taxis are a total ripoff, and I definitely do not recommend taking a taxi from the street. Use one of the services instead. I use Tick Tack Taxi (www.ticktack.cz), Taxi AAA (http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/), and Uber, which works well (although, like everywhere, surge pricing is something to watch for).
If you’re heading toward Vienna, I’d recommend either Český Krumlov or Mikulov. Český Krumlov is one of my favorite places on the planet and an amazing UNESCO World Heritage site — it’s an entire town from the 14th century flawlessly preserved. Just gorgeous. Mikulov, in southern Moravia, is in the wine region, and is also a really nice place to be, moreso in summertime. Plus, there’s a nice waterpark just outside of town (http://www.aqualand-moravia.cz/en)/.
If you’re heading north toward Berlin, I’d recommend taking a day to check out Bad Schandau, a spa town with a kickass thermal bath (http://www.toskanaworld.net/web/en/therme_bad_schandau/home.asp), and the Czech and Saxon Switzerland national park, famous for its sandstone formations, including a couple of natural bridges.

I spent this summer travelling around Europe and nowhere quite captured my attention and gave me that “I never want to leave” feeling as Prague.
From its incredible architecture to its pumping night life, I was lucky enough to have a good friend show me around the city for four days. If you could spare only a weekend or a whole lifetime this fairy tale hot spot would still never fail to entice and surprise.

We had explored many places before going to Prague because of our love to discover new places. Some of the places I list below are the places we had previously explored, and some of them we found by chance. PS: We tried to explore some concept places rather than the most popular places on this trip.
Cafefin is not a breakfast place where you can spend hours as we are used to. For example, you wake up so early, you’re in a hurry, you want to have a healthy and delicious breakfast. Then here is the right address! This busy and popular cafe is the first Vietnamese coffehouse in Prague. There are mini tables and the stools at the long bar that you can sit. The staff are incredibly friendly. The Vietnamese baguette category in the menu attracted our attention. Baguette varieties were not the kind we were used to, but I have to say that I liked it very much! The cafe is also known for its sweet chao rice and homemade yoghurt with black rice.
The weather was very cold in April. Therefore, when we were too cold, we would urgently sit in any café we found by chance. That’s also how we discovered Tricafe. :) Tricafe was such a pleasant place that we have wanted to stay for 2 hours. We felt like we were at home with old-looking wooden tables, armchair seats in our grandmothers’ house and rocking chairs. You could read books from their library or you could take a glance at drawings on the wall as a mini exhibition. By the way their coffee was pretty good.
Trdelnik has started to spread after Easter markets that were established in Czech Republic in 2002 and it has become one of the symbols of Prague. We have gone to Prague during Easter so we had the opportunity to experience it in the Easter markets. Trdelnik is made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick, then grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix. I’ve tried the Nutella version of it. You can find different versions of Trdelnik in various shapes and with different flavors. Especially in the summer, you can find Trdelnik with different kinds of ice cream in Prague.
Restaurant Bella Vista has the best view in the city. Its panoramic view stretches from the Petrin Tower all the way to Prague Castle Hillsides. It streches from the west to the north, it provides spectacular views of greenish copper cupolas, narrow cobblestone streets, bridges connecting both river banks and green gardens from red-roof tops of centuries-old houses. Actually, we had come here to visit the Strahov Monastery. After the visit to the monastery, this amazing view has made our day! We couldn’t leave there without drinking a green lager to the accompaniment of this view.
Kantyna is a restaurant where you can taste great meats in Prague. In the entrance part, you can choose the meats that you would like to eat in the butcher section or if you are in a hurry, you can prefer the meats that are already cooked. We chose to choose our meat from scratch and we started to wait at our table. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages are also available, but we wanted to try local beer with our meats. This was the first place we stopped by after we got off the plane. We were very lucky because this place was so close to the hostel. Since I got back from Prague, I’ve been telling everyone about this place. The meats were absolutely incredibly delicious.
Cafe Slavia was the place where Nazım Hikmet had written some poems in Prague. There is a portrait of Nazım Hikmet which is painted by one of the Czech artists. However, the place also inspired many important literary artists. Kafka also had been going to this cafe while writing his novels.
First of all, if you want to go this place, you have to make a reservation. That’s why we’ve waited too long to sit, but the friendly staff was really helpful. I really like their food presentation. They served a meat with a kind of bread that they called “knedliky” and cranberry marmalade. It was really delicious!
I’m a real John Lennon fan and that’s why I don’t recommend this place. We really wanted to have a drink at John Lennon Pub. However, we could not spend more than 10 minutes. Due to the fact that the waiters didn’t let us have a drink here. They said we could sit here if we ate something. If we only wanted to have a drink, we couldn’t sit even if there were available tables inside. There wasn’t anything there to connect with John Lennon except his photos. I would love to have waiters understand and embrace his spirit.
The Hemingway Bar is the most popular cocktail bar in Prague. This place deserves all highest points because of the friendly waitresses and the wide cocktail menu. The name of the cocktail in the photo is Snow Globe. I used to like to watch the snow globe when i was a kid. I felt the same feelings because of this cocktail. Watching the coconut particles brought me back to my childhood. If you travel to Prague, I’d say that you should go to Hemingway Bar.
Enjoy your trip!

My first trip to Prague was in 2015, and I have been living in Prague almost for a year now. Considering the touristic season is already here (it was more than 20 degrees whole week!), I thought I should better create a post answering questions that I get from friends about visiting Prague and share the places I visited for the last 3 years with you all.
This post is ideal if you are planning to visit Prague for a short amount of time (more than a day, less than a month) and want to visit the key places of the city according to my experience. The post is not giving clear transportation methods (how long it takes from A to B, which trams go there etc), and only intends to initiate a list of places that I find worth visiting at your first Prague trip.
Prague has a beautiful Old Town (Staré Mesto) and it is a perfect place to start your trip. There you can see the Prague Astronomical Clock (currently being renovated until August 2018) which is the oldest functioning astronomical clock in the world. You will find its place in old town by just joining the always-waiting tourist groups in front of the clock because every hour twelve apostles appear from small windows of the clock. This parade takes almost a minute and is definitely worth watching. If you want to read more about the figures and the apostles of the clock, read here.
After you walked around the Old Town, you can move to Charles Bridge (Karlův most) which is one of the bridges that crosses the Vltava River. The historical bridge hosts 30 sculptures and sculpture groups on its walls. Although it is the most crowded place in the daytime due to the heavy interest of tourists, you would not want to miss the view from the bridge and the daylight look on the sculptures. I recommend visiting the bridge again in the evening to experience the charming lit version of the bridge and the beautiful city under the evening lights one more time.
From the Charles Bridge you can connect to Kampa Island. There is a little channel called Čertovka (Devil’s Channel) with an old mill (not functioning anymore). Around the old mild there is a Vodník (can be translated as Water Demon) sitting and watching for the possible souls to store in porcelain bottles* :) At the same time, this happens to be my favourite part of Kampa Island. Also, there is a restaurant next to the mill, and it has a cute balcony and two tables outside, by looking to it I always think it can be good choice for a romantic dinner ❤
* In Czech folklore, it is believed that evil vodníci (plural of vodník) try to drown people when they happen to swim in their territory and store the souls of the drowned in porcelain bottles.
From the little channel bridge, you can walk to John Lennon Wall. In my opinion, currently it looks like more of a name+surname wall of the people who sprayed their names onto the wall, but it should be seen for the worthy cause of the wall, against wars, and inspired by John Lennon’s peaceful acts.
Kampa Park is very pretty in the spring, a must-see for visitors in summer. You can see bronze statues of three crawling babies*, by the Czech sculptor David Černý and have some photos with them like I did :) The sculptor is known as a controversial artist and you can find his installations at many different spots in Prague. For example, he is the artist behind the famous Head of Franz Kafka and Man Hanging Out; the man in the subject is Sigmund Freud who was born in Moravia, depicted as hanging by one hand not sure if to hold onto or let go.
* There is an ugly TV tower in Prague and some of the crawling babies added on it to make it a bit prettier. If you happen to visit TV tower area, you can see the crawling babies climbing to the tower :) The babies that climb to the tower are made from fiberglass, a bit lighter than their bronze siblings at Kampa Park :)
While you are at Kampa Island, you can visit Museum Kampa, one of the many modern art museums in Prague. I haven’t visited the museum myself but it is on my to-do list. You should find Kampa’s yellow penguins as they are pretty cute and don’t forget to check them again in the evening because they are also lit!
Another must-see place, and also very popular by all tourists, is Prague Castle (Pražský hrad). The castle complex is really big and considered the largest ancient castle in the world and St. Vitus Cathedral is situated within the complex. You can also get one of the best views of Prague from the walls surrounding the castle complex. I am known to take more photos whenever we visit the castle area with our guests who visit the castle for the first time :)
But what I like the most about the castle is the surrounding gardens. Awesomely designed gardens make spring/summer or for that matter any good weather trip worthwhile! Currently, as you can see at the first photo of the post, spring is very inviting, and the castle gardens are full of nice trees, flowers and awaking greens ❤ You can check all the gardens listed here: https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle-for-visitors/gardens
Talking about castles and nice weathers, I also recommend visiting Vyšehrad (means upper castle in Czech). From Vyšehrad, you can get an amazing river view one which you can’t get from Prague Castle. Probably by now, you already know that I can get very excited about city gardens, and as expected from me, I very much liked Vyšehrad gardens, too ❤
Prague is full of parks and gardens, and I am very grateful that I am living in a city that everybody can access the green areas easily! We (me and my husband) are living in Vinohrady (means vineyards in Czech) and the closest park to us is Grébovka. As declared in the name of Vinohrady, Grébovka also has one remaining vineyard from the many historical vineyards once covered all park area in the 14th century. The vineyard has a cute wooden gazebo restaurant & wine bar where they can also have weddings :) And my favourite part of the vineyard is that it also has a winery where you can get the wine of the same vineyard ❤
In my opinion, Grébovka is the most romantic park in Prague and we enjoy our evening walks (even more romantic, thanks to the authentic street lamps of Prague ❤) there. If you’re staying in the same area, I recommend checking this park as well, if you like daylight park visits more, picnic season is already open!
Up until now, I listed almost all the basic touristic must-see places in Prague. If your trip is 2–3 days long, you possibly have enough places to discover in the city. But if you are more like nature-lover type and prefer doing outdoor activities maybe you can also check the nature parks I enjoyed visiting.
Divoká Šárka (Wild Šárka) is a nature reserve and named after a female mythological warrior Šárka. There is a small canyon in the park, and it is pretty good for trekking. As a plus, you can also have a nice view after you climb the hill. It is a perfect place for enjoying nature in Prague without getting too far* from the city.
* From where we live, it takes about an hour to get there, but it totally worths the effort.
Stromovka is a very beautiful and large park. It was established in the 13th century as a game reserve and converted into a park later in 19th century. The park has a style of an English landscape garden, and there is a pond that I liked very much spending time around it.
Prokopské údolí (Prokop Valley) is an amazing place to see and from where we live it takes almost the same time as Šárka to go there. There are two small rivers, a beautiful lake, and a natural reserve area. There are playgrounds for children and benches to rest if you want to have a rest. When we first visited the area, I fell in love with nature there, and I want to visit as much as possible this year.
These are all my favourite outdoor spaces so far and let me know if you can suggest some more for me to visit this year!
Before we finalise the post, I want to mention two places I saw families with kids enjoying their time there, and you might want to add these places to your travel plan if you have children.
Disclaimer: We don’t have a child so that I don’t have a personal experience in any of the places that I recommend from a child-friendly view. I just thought it might give some ideas to the guests with kids.
Prague Zoo is a very good place to visit, even if you are not a child nor have a child :) But I highly recommend, if you have a child ❤ The admission price for a family of 4 (2 parents + 2 children) is 600 CZK (about 24 EUR — April 2018). I usually have mixed feelings about the zoos but this one does not feel like an animal prison, instead, the animals have a lot of space, they wander seemingly freely and inspire kids to learn about them in a natural looking and feeling setup. When I visited the zoo in 2015, I thought except polar animals all animals are doing fine, but the condition of polar animals did not seem enough to me to support them in Prague hot summer :(
I know, Prague Zoo was seriously damaged when the flood hit the city in 2002, and hope the animals will get better treatment after the flood’s effects completely reverted.
My second suggestion for families with kids would be visiting Mořský svět (Sea World) Aquarium. It was relatively small and boring for adults but kids were having a lot of fun there when we visited the aquarium in 2016. The ticket price for a family of four is 850 CZK (about 34 EUR — April 2018).
Overall, I think Prague is an enchanting city with its different styles of architecture from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era. Dark towers, colourful and unique style of historical buildings, doors, windows, bridges, and cobblestone streets (unpack those high heels now!) carries the memories of a long eventful history. Prague also offers a great deal of green within the city with parks and natural areas. I think everyone can find a reason to love Prague and bring good memories back to home, or maybe make it their new home ❤

The first time I travelled to the Czech Republic was in the early 1990s. Communism was collapsing and, despite the obvious scars of decades of oppression, there was hope in the air. Modern and democratically leaning, Czechia (yes it’s really called that now) along with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia (or the Visegrad Group) showed promise in bridging the East-West divide. I’ve travelled back many times since, happily noting the transformation of Prague from a city behind the Iron Curtain to a modern, upbeat, western city that has retained cool elements of its communist past.
To me, no neighbourhood displays this better than Žižkov — a grittier, historically working-class quarter infused with hipster cafés, craft brew pubs, and cool retro designers. With its awesome blend of old and new Prague, Žižkov is not to be missed.
FRIDAY4PM Shake off the jet lag with a nice walk in Park Rajská Zahrada and stop by the beer garden for a quick refreshment before heading out to dinner.
6PM Nothing beats jet lag better than Czech comfort food and a well poured beer. Head to Hostinec U Vodoucha, a classic hospoda packed with locals, for an authentic experience. I suggest the Pork Knuckle (189 koruna) and a pint of Mordýř 12° (45 koruna). The richness of the pork combined with the pickled veggies and a good lager to wash it down can’t be beat.
9 PM After dinner walk back to Namesti Jiří z Podebrad to take in nighttime views of the church, Kostel Nejsvětějšího Srdce Páně, and then head underground to BeerGeek. A craft brew house that’s constantly rotating its great selection of draft beers, they also offer small bites including a HUGE selection of chicken wings (monkey wings) that pair perfectly with what’s on tap. The bar’s warm, fun atmosphere draws people in and it can get pretty crowded on a Friday night so if you’d rather climb back into bed, check out their selection of to-go beers.
SATURDAY9AM Rise and shine! Žižkov is home to Vitkov Hill, a national monument to Jan Žižka’s victory over the Crusaders in 1420. It’s also a great place to take a quick run or hike to wake up. If you climb to the top you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of Prague from the base of the massive equestrian statue of Jan Žižka.
11 AM Refreshed, and having taken in the stunning views of Prague head back down to My Coffee Story. A modern, neighbourhood coffee shop that serves great espresso and a nice selection of breakfast foods. Try the soft boiled eggs, Tri vejce ve skle, (135 koruna) or the homemade waffle with fresh fruit and mascarpone (110 koruna) to get your morning started off right.
1PM Žižkov is home to some great up-and-coming local designers. A few of my favorite shops include the über hip, cult, Czech bag brand, Playbag on Borivojova and Botas 66 on Krizkovskeho, which carries a wide range of runners, designed after Communist era Czech sport shoes, Botas or botasky. With new designs ranging from whimsical rainbow to classic brown leather this stop is sure to be a hit no matter what your style.
Let the Communist exploration continue with a visit to Bohemian Retro, a vintage shop specializing in items from pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. Despite the selection being a little more tired than I remember, it is still worth a quick stop. A more modern assortment of women’s wear can be found at SugarBat, which carries a wide variety of retro clothing that they describe as “pin-up, rockabilly and goth styles.” Nearby, on Mánesova, lingerie designer Zuzana Kubickova’s showroom and studio has a stunning selection of women’s intimates along some beautiful outerwear collections.
3PM Czechs love to grab coffee and a sweet afternoon snack. Stop by the newly opened Donut Shop and grab a coffee and brown-butter (56 koruna), or maple-bacon (54 koruna) doughnut to-go. Do as the locals do, and head back to the many benches at the square to enjoy your snack while you take in the sites and do a little people watching.
4PM Freshly refueled, or perhaps in need of another cup of coffee, saunter on over to Jirak Farmer’s Market. Described by Taste of Prague as “one of the best things to do in Prague,” this quaint market has the rare distinction of being on Wednesday to Saturday. The food and decorations change with the season, and the selection of fresh fruits, meats, coffee, wine and hot food items in fabulous. People rave about the crepes from Galetka, and the coffee from Kavovy Klub.
5PM End your shopping experience with a visit to NeverEnough. The local design shop sports an in-house bar, great music and friendly staff. Grab a cocktail or beer while perusing NeverEnough brandwear (my favourite) in addition to a more limited selection of shirts from several European designers.
8PM For upscale food in a relaxed environment, head to Riccardo Lucque’s La Bottega Gastronomica. The airy bistro has perfect window seats overlooking Mahlerovy Sady Park which makes for great people watching while enjoying the fine selection of delicious daily dishes, homemade pasta and divine wines.
SUNDAY10AM A visit to Prague wouldn’t be complete without a classic Czech breakfast of koláč from Antoninovo Pekarstvi. Be sure to try the makovy (poppy seed), and tvaroh (similar to cottage cheese), as well as the seasonal fruit selection. Apricot is always a favourite.
Noon The strange, somewhat ugly TV tower, with freaky climbing babies, built on an old Jewish cemetery defines Žižkov’s (and Prague’s) landscape. To catch a wonderful last bird’s eye view, take the elevator to the observatory (230 koruna) where you can watch films about Prague.
WHERE TO STAYAirBnB has a great selection of apartments for rent that are perfectly located to enjoy the most of Žižkov. Use this link to get a $40 credit!

It’s kind of ridiculous that I’m writing about Prague, my first destination after my month long program on my last leg of the trip in Croatia. But Prague represents a special place for me as it was a place to drown my depressed state with cheap delicious beer after studying the Holocaust intensively for a month.
Prague is a popular destination for not only Europeans but also the floods of Asian tourists who come in huge groups on massive coaches. Why do they all come halfway around the world?
Could it be the Charles Bridge where brilliant performers and caricature artists invade the sides of the bridge? Or is it the famously disappointing Old Astronomical Clock that leaves eager crowds to the tip of their toes every hour only to realize its short act?
The infamous tourist attractions of Prague are deserving of their title as some sights really reward your hard earned tourist dollars. For example, the nightscape of Prague Castle and Charles Bridge is ridiculously beautiful and one to be remembered.
But if you have at least more than a day in Prague, the rest of the city is worth exploring and may even outweigh the attractions listed in your Lonely Plant or Rick Steve’s guide. Even 5 nights here wasn’t enough to get a full taste of Prague, but if you need some ideas, take a look at my suggestions below!
Nábřeží Edvarda Beneše, 118 00 Praha 7, Czechia
I hate to see this place getting busier than it already is with the locals enjoying their beer (32 crowns for half a litre if I’m not mistaken) over sweeping Panorama views. Forget Petrin Park, you want to check out Letna Park for its many beer gardens, musicians/DJs and also friendly vibes.
Head to the red Metronome statue in the centre of the park and on top of the stairs (above the beer gardens) which was built to symbolize the long struggle against communism. Here you will see a familiar skate park for those 90’s kids that remember Tony Hawk’s skateboarding games. On the other side you will see a magnificent panorama of Old and New Prague.
V Pevnosti 159/5b, 128 00 Praha 2, Czechia
This one is a little more well-known with tourists, but it still deserves a spot on my list because it is expansive enough to make you feel like you’re the only one in the park. Relatively close to the Old Town, when the city starts getting hot and bustling with the package tours, escape to Vyšehrad for some peace and beautiful views.
Some of Prague’s oldest buildings are housed here, so for history geeks like myself, it’s such a treat.
Kostelní 1320/42, 170 78 Praha 7, Czechia
If you’re looking for some unconventional but well done museums, avoid the Communism museum — made up of cheap write ups and replicas of everything, and come to the National Technical Museum! Being an Arts student, I try to stay away from anything technical. But the inner boy in me came out when I saw the museums impressive fleet of cars, motorcycles, and planes. The museum itself is quite large and also has some historical context of the importance of these products so to add the technological aspect of experiencing Prague, the technical museum is an awesome alternative to the traditional museums.
Also students get a discount so make sure you bring your ISIC card or school ID with the years on it.
1, 120 00 Praha 2-Vinohrady, Czechia
This one was a bit of a lucky find along the way to Vyšehrad. It’s a quiet park that’s tucked in a nicer neighbourhood of Prague and I highly recommend grabbing some groceries and setting up picnic. If you’re lazier like me and enjoy beer more than bread, bring a bottle(s) and head out to the terrace in front of the classy restaurant in the middle. Here you will see another magnificent panorama of the newer areas of the city.
This one is a bit of a cheat because it’s not really in Prague, but it’s close proximity to the city with loads of sights make it an awesome way to escape the swarm of tourists. While Kutna Hora can be done within half a day, for those that take longer or would appreciate having quaint peace, a night or two wouldn’t hurt either!
Some sights in Kutna Hora include the infamous Sedlec Ossuary or AKA the Bone church (which is extremely short and close to being a tourist trap if it wasn’t for the freaky nature of having so many bones displayed openly), St. Barbara’s Church, and the Jesuit College — which generally opens exhibitions and other galleries.
A quick tip for travellers by train, make sure you purchase the ticket that goes to Kutna Hora Město. The main railway station for Kutna Hora is actually quite a bit ways from the actual town so make sure you remember to transfer into a smaller local train to take you to the Město.
The fact that I am able to remember these places at the top of my head must mean something. I hope you will also enjoy some of the places shared to me by locals, fellow backpackers, and Google. If you enjoyed these travel ideas for Prague and would like to see them for the other cities, let me know with a comment or a like!

I always thought eastern Europe would be cold and grey and Prague is no exception. But, as I walk past grungy stone walls under a slate sky, I notice the city’s canvas begin to fill with color. Each loud scarf or alleyway stencil builds anticipation toward my colorful destination, The Lennon Wall. However, as I weave through the side streets of this quiet, cobblestoned neighborhood in search of this mural homage to the late Beatle’s front-man, the wall is nowhere to be found! Just before I turn to my map for guidance, I spot a huddle of travelers staring at a simple message written across whitewashed facade in the distance. “Wall Is Over.”
All that remains from this crowdsourced feat of artistic expression were these big block letters. What a buzz kill! But then, as I look closer, I see a streak of fresh paint coloring the outline of an umbrella in the bottom right corner. Maybe this is a more apt portrait of Prague’s beauty. A place with a medieval core spared from world-war destruction, a towering castle beyond the reach of any mere mortal, and a body of citizens freed from communism just 15 years prior still teems with the rumblings of creative individuality. Just hours after the wall was painted over, as is customary practice every four years, the people have already begun to fill the space with life.
Prague is alive. The buildings’ imposing exteriors contain the thumping passion of proud Czechs. I could hear the city’s collective effervescence in the the fraternal “Čau!” as anyone enters or leaves a room or through the cracked window of an underground pub. The beer is cheap, tasty, and omnipresent. More signs for Pilsner Urquell (the local water) fill the streets than stoplights. With early sunsets, bars that never close, and pints that range from $1–1.50 USD, it is no wonder Prague’s happening nightlife is no secret to the world. One simply needs to step outside to hear packs of fashionable young people that make the streets feel like the hallways of the United Nations. To walk the streets is to share a drink with both the buildings and their inhabitants — each additional round bringing you closer to the city’s pulsing soul.
It is hard to decide whether the streets are more beautiful by day or by night. By day, the signature burnt orange roofs that top the baroque buildings give the old town a sense of cohesion, as if to cross the Charles Bridge is to step into a 14th century universe. By night, streaks of light shoot up Gothic facades like shooting stars, creating long shadows that imbue even the most ordinary storefront with a sense of magic. The Vlatava River snakes through the city like a moat for the Castle, while trams carry the lifeblood that courses through the city’s veins. Prague’s hip energy remains inclusive and accessible. Like leaving a dinner party at the house of an incredibly welcoming host, I felt a sense of home that demands a speedy return.

Ages ago I promised my wife Anne a trip to Prague, one of the European capitals she had never visited. I finally got round to organising it this year.
This piece is not about our destination, but about our journey. We try to avoid unnecessary flights and last year we bought a Tesla Model 3, so why not make it a road trip? We wanted to document what it is like to travel by Tesla. Other electric vehicles are available but I cannot speak with any authority about what the experience of driving them on a similar trip might be. Moreover, if you are looking for tips about Prague, or other cities, look elsewhere.
Prague is about 1100 km from where we live west of Paris. After consulting the road atlas, the Tesla website and various guides to the Czech Republic we decided on a six-day trip. Two days driving, with a stopover in Heidelberg, two nights in Prague, two in Karlovy Vary, and one in Luxembourg on the way back, (thereby knocking a second unvisited European capital off the list).
Having chosen where we wanted to go, and when, we let Tesla make most of the remaining choices. We picked hotels which had Tesla destination chargers, and where there was a choice went as close to the city centre as possible1. We weren’t trying to do this on a budget (it was a birthday present after all), and once in the hotels we wanted to be able to visit our destinations without getting into the car again.
No visas were required for us, but we did have to get two for the car: the German emissions sticker that allowed us in to Heidelberg city centre, and the Czech motorway vignette.
I usually charge my Model 3 to around 90 per cent, which gives around 430 km of range. The car warns against frequent charging above 90% and the last 10% is slow, but for long trips I push it up to 95 per cent (around 470 km) which I did on this occasion.
As we packed we kept a watchful eye on the developing coronavirus situation. By 29 February France had identified 73 cases of Covid-19. Germany 79. The situation in Northern Italy was causing serious concern, but travel to and from Germany, the Czech Republic and Luxembourg was not subject to controls2.
Sunday 1 March Home to Heidelberg (659 km)
The plan was that this would involve about six hours driving and one hour charging. The on-board route planner suggested charging at the Reims-Champagne services on the A4 for 15 minutes and then again near Metz for 25. But I managed to drive past the chargers in the service area and couldn’t legally turn back so we had to go on to the next exit, turn round, charge on the Paris-bound side, and then complete the circuit by continuing to the next exit towards Paris and turning round again. Wasted time about 40 minutes; wasted distance about 60 kilometres.
Our second charging stop was in Hauconcourt near Metz, and by the time we had had a quick lunch we were charged up and in danger of incurring idle charges3.
Tesla superchargers in France are frequently located in hotel car parks (often Accor brands) near to but not on the autoroute. This means that you don’t have to be on the motorway to have access to them. However some, such as Reims-Champagne are in the motorway service areas, and others — such as Metz are in commercial centres.
We reached Heidelberg in time to have a walk around the Altstadt and up to the castle before it got dark. We put the car on charge in the hotel car park overnight.
Monday 2 March Heidelberg to Prague (513 km)
Wanting to maximize our time in Prague we drove straight there, stopping only to buy our Czech motorway vignette and to recharge at the last supercharger in Germany (Wernberg-Kôblitz). Most of the route was on the A6 through southern Germany, which was consistently busy with trucks, but no serious congestion. Many junctions and bridges had roadworks so speed limits kept oscillating between 80, 100, 120 and 130 kph, and for some stretches, no limit at all. Prudence (the name I have given the car in recognition of her cautious approach to overtaking and driving in general) effortlessly accelerated to 180 kph, but I didn’t test her beyond that, and didn’t keep that up for long.
We crossed the border into the Czech republic without really noticing it, and certainly without having to stop which, for someone who grew up and lived for almost 40 years with an Iron Curtain across Europe, still came as a surprise. The car took us by what seemed a circuitous route round the back of the castle to our hotel, but when we saw the streets that a more direct approach would have involved we understood why.
Tuesday 3 March Prague (0 km)
Our hotel was ideally situated between the Old Town and the Castle. Trams and buses abound, but we were close enough to walk everywhere.
Wednesday 4 March Prague to Karlovy Vary (129 km)
After 48 hours in Prague we made the short journey to Karlovy Vary. The road was busy with trucks, and being upgraded in various stretches, but we had no hold-ups and no hiccups.
This once-grand spa town has an abundance of C19 and early C20 hotels crowded round the river and thermal springs. After checking in to an elegant and imposing hotel — again chosen because of its Tesla destination charger — we had plenty of time to walk around, get our bearings, and find some dinner.
Thursday 5 March: Karlovy Vary (O km)
A beautiful sunny day ideal for a good long walk in the woods and some time in the pool.
Friday 6 March: Karlovy Vary to Luxembourg (783 km)
A 9 o’clock start for a full day of driving, under grey skies and with a lot of rain, sleet and drizzle. As before we followed Tesla’s suggested route, driving through the Fichtel Mountains and the forests of Franconia before stopping three hours out from Karlovy Vary in the small town of Motten. Here, in what seemed like the middle of nowhere, we found a brand-new 16-stall Supercharger at which we were the only customer. We also found the wonderful Gasthof zum Biber where we had an early, and copious, lunch.
Motten was right for our East-West journey, but I suspect most of its users will be from the nearby A7 motorway which takes traffic from Northern Germany to Italy.
We saw at first hand quite how many trees there are this part of Germany, and were encouraged to see how many fields have been covered in part with solar panels.
From Motten we were able to get to Luxembourg, albeit with only about 30 kilometres left in the ‘tank’. The most difficult part of the journey was the last 500 metres to the hotel because of extensive road works around the station. I have to confess to a certain amount of ‘range concern’ if not full-blown ‘range anxiety’ but took comfort in Elon Musk’s assurance that there are 10–20 km of reserve capacity even after the screen reads empty. And if the worst came to the worst I could pull in to any service station/hotel/business with a standard electric plug and hook up to that for a while.
Once again, we had chosen the hotel not only because of its convenient location, but also because it has a destination charger. And for the first time the network let us down, because it is an older charger which does not recognise the Model 3 (at least, it wouldn’t connect with ours). Fortunately there was an adjacent Mennekes charger, which the hotel staff advised us to use.
Day 7: Luxembourg to home (418 km)
The car was fully-charged by the morning, and after a couple of hours walking around the historic centre of Luxembourg, and a detour to leave Luxembourg because of the same road works we had encountered on the way in, we headed straight home. Again one brief charging stop, at the same Reims-Champagne services we used on the way out. We could have made it without charging but we would not have been able to drive at 130 kph.
Afterword
I had considered before setting out whether to subscribe to the Chargemap Pass4, or one of the alternative networks of chargers5, for added peace of mind, but decided against, wanting to test the Tesla network.
The test was passed. During the six days we drove a total of 2373 km consuming 426 KwH of electricity at an average consumption of 180 Wh per kilometer. Much of the trip was on motorways where we maintained a cruising speed of 130 kph, sometimes more. We had lights on for the great majority of the trip, and wipers for much of it too.
We missed one Supercharger because we didn’t follow the instructions closely enough; and one exit because we weren’t paying attention to the navigation system. The busiest supercharger we came across (Metz) had five stands occupied out of eight, at the others there were only one or two other cars, and none at all in Motten. The destination chargers all worked well except the last.
We had one screen restart while driving, which was disconcerting, but lasted only 40 seconds or so.
I make a lot of use of the basic level of Autopilot (Traffic-aware cruise control), primarily so I don’t have to maintain pressure with my right leg. It is particularly useful in dense traffic which is running at low speeds or stopping and starting. I use Autosteer and Navigate on Autopilot more sparingly, and find that they work best in relatively empty roads. The driving habits of other drivers are sometimes more aggressive than Autosteer is comfortable with: for example if I pull out to overtake, and then — as often happens — the car behind me pulls out at more or less the same time, and close behind — the Tesla will abort the manoeuvre, sensing danger. That is safe, but unnecessarily prudent — hence my pet name for the car.
Our Supercharger stops cost about €80 in all for a total of 270 KwH; recharging the battery at home to the level at which we started will have cost about €10. Had we taken our old (diesel) car we would have used about 150 litres, at least €200 worth of fuel.
The remaining electricity was included in our overnight parking. The autoroutes in France cost about €60 in total, and we spent €25 on vignettes. That gives a total non-accommodation cost about €175, although that takes no account of depreciation on the car.
We could have flown to Prague for about the same basic price, but to that we would have had to add airport transfers, and if we wanted to see Karlovy Vary as well, taxi or bus fares.
We drove through four countries, visited two capital cities, two historic towns and a couple of places we’d never heard of before.
As of Friday 13 March the Czech Republic has closed its borders. When the world calms down, we’d consider similar trips to other European cities.
_____________
1. Hotels: Crowne Plaza, Heidelberg; Hoffmeister, Prague; Savoy Westend, Karlovy Vary; Radisson Park, Luxembourg.
2. Anne guessed that by the time we returned there would be 300 cases of Covid-19 in France, I guessed 500. In fact there were 700, and it was becoming clear that that was almost certainly an underestimate. We tried to avoid crowds and — at the time of writing — have experienced no unusual symptoms. Whether we were increasing or reducing our risk, or the risk to others, by travelling we have no idea.

My ranking: 4.5 stars out of 5
Heading to Prague, Czech Republic? My top pool pick is the Podolí Swimming Stadium. There are a number of pools to choose from including the newish Aquacentre Šutka but I have selected the Podolí pool as #1 as it is historically interesting and the 3 pools are amazing.
The pool complex was built in the 1960s on the site of a former quarry mine along the river Vltava. It was recently added to the national cultural monuments of the Czech Republic.
You have three pools to explore here! The complex features both an outdoor AND indoor 50m pool, a 33m long outdoor diving pool, a huge spiraling slide, a steam room, a Finnish sauna (wood-burning stove), a solarium, a rehabilitation centre and a restaurant. I am a big fan of swimming rehabilitation so it was nice to see the rehab services prominently displayed. We don’t promote this much externally in BC/Canada?
The inside pool (pictured above) is designed with a big wave along the roof by Czech architect Richard Podzemny. The large viewing area for the outdoor pool is situated on top of the wavy roof. The pool is deep, clean and well maintained with crystal clear water. You need to go through the warm drying off area, showers and then wash your feet as you exit to the pool, which helps keep the water nice and clean.
I had a fantastic swim in each of the pools on a hot summer evening. My favourite was the indoor 50m which was quiet and peaceful as everyone was outside enjoying the sun.
I was surprised at the lack of lifeguards! For 3 pools they had two lifeguards in bright orange shorts (that we saw; perhaps it was a shift change or they’re in disguise?). However, the lifeguards were very active in patrolling and telling people what not to do such as jumping off the side edge into the pool. They may or may not have blown the whistle at my kids.😬
The change rooms are old and Soviet-era looking but they have modernized the locker system. When you arrive you’re given a wrist band (pictured here below on my son). You use this to enter and exit the facility and it connects to a locker of your choice. Very cool!
One interesting thing is that this pool is connected to Czech Television at the top of the hill, improving the energy use of both. Cold water is pumped up to the TV building to cool down the studio rooms and servers. The heated water is then pumped back to the stadium and heats up the pool. The water never drops below 26C, even in the outdoor pool in the winter.
Finished your swim? Make sure to stop by the restaurant on-deck and pick up a pint of beer and “Nakládaný Hermelín” (Czech marinated cheese — a classic Czech pub food, one of my favourites).

Many tourists wonder how Prague could survive the war without any significant damage. Not that much true though, but comparing to other cities in Europe, Prague was one of the lucky ones. In this post I would like to take you for a virtual tour to tell you more about what you can experience on my Memorial Tour. Just in case you are still note decided to book.
Memorial Tour usually starts next to the Municipal House. This is the best place to talk about changes in our history, how we transformed from thousand years old Czech Kingdom to Czechoslovakian Republic and how Nazis took control over the country. The Municipal House was the location of the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence in 1918. It is here, where literally, the freedom was born.
Let’s immerse to the streets of Old Town and talk about how life changed under Nazi rule. Did you know, that in the first days of occupation, Nazis ordered a change-over to a right-hand traffic system, and we had only 9 hours to prepare for it? Many brave people joined protests that culminated in November 1939 when all Czech universities were closed and over 1200 students were sent to Nazi concentration camps. We will see the Charles University, the symbol of democracy and fight for the freedom.
There are so many brave people that put their lives for our country. Many of them were members of the resistance, many others died in the last days of the war when they stood against Nazi occupiers. Streets of Prague were full of barricades from any material they could find — cobblestones, furniture, cars… We will see the traces of this fights, that are still visible — you just have to know where to look. And of course, we will also talk about the Jewish community and their members, who were send to various concentration camps all over Europe. Did you know, that Nazis made a decision to protect all synagogues, just to use them as their museums?
The major part of our Memorial Tour will be about one of the bravest actions that was ever done — Operation Anthropoid. The Butcher of Prague or The Blond Beast are two (of many more) nicknames of Reinhard Heydrich, the new governor of Czech lands. He arrived to Prague in 1941 and immediately started persecutions of Czech political and intellectual personalities. He also gave orders to establish a ghetto and to start with the Jewish transports. He eventually paid for all what he did to Czechs in 1942 when two Czechoslovakian paratroopers from the resistance tried assassinate him. To know how it all happened we will visit the church of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in New Town district.
Are you interested to know more, to see it all? Just join me for Memorial Tour.
P.S. I will try to show you also the Petschek Palace. This building was build shortly before the WW2 for the merchant banker Julius Petschek, with all the modern gadgets such as tube post or paternoster lift. During the Nazi occupation the Palace became the Gestapo headquarters. The horrific tortures and interrogations took place in its basement, and there is a small exhibition about what happened in the rooms nowadays. Petschek Palace is used by the Ministry of Trade and Industry today, therefore the visit is only on request.

Edgar Krása, one of the survivors of the Nazis concentration camps, died in February 2017. As he had mentioned in one of the interviews, “It won’t be long before there won’t be anybody left who can tell this.” That’s why he dedicated the last years of his life to traveling and talking about his experiences from the WW2. And he was right, less and less people it is who remember those horrors. And they won’t be there to speak of them forever. So, it is only up to us to carry their stories to future generations. To know some of these stories, you just need to walk a bit through the streets of Prague.
Many tourists wonder how Prague could survive the war without any significant damage. Not that much true though, but comparing to other cities in Europe, Prague was one of the lucky ones. In this post you’re going to see only the most important buildings connected with the Nazi occupation. There are more of them throughout the city, of course. Furthermore, I am not mentioning the Jewish Quarter, which is a special chapter and is a must visit when talking about the war times.
We all know about the terrible bombing of Dresden in February 13–14th 1945. But did you know that because of a navigation error, several planes of US Army Air Force managed to get to Prague? They dropped about 152 tons of bombs onto the city of Prague, 700 people died and about one hundred historical sights and building were destroyed. One of them was the 14th century Emmaus Monastery, where you can today admire a new roof with two towers that was added in 1960s. Even though the big part of the church was damaged, its gothic features survived.
Another witness of the bombing is the Dancing House — designed by Vlado Milunic and Frank Gehry in 90s. The original house that used to stand there was also destroyed during the bombing.
On 15 March 1945 Hitler entered Prague and proclaimed the country the german Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Hitler spent several hours here, always wished to return back. The honour guard formed on the first courtyard of Prague Castle and then Hitler took the famous picture overlooking the city from the window of the palace. This photo even became the official post stamp.
Just around the corner from the Wenceslas square stands the monumental building of Petschek Palace. It was build shortly before the WW2 for the merchant banker Julius Petchek, with all the modern gadgets such as tube post or paternoster lift. During the Nazi occupation the Palace became the Gestapo headquarters. The horrific tortures and interrogations took place in its basement, and there is a small exhibition about what happened in the rooms nowadays.
Not very far from the Jewish quarter, walking towards the river, you will find a building with triangle roof that belongs to the Law Faculty of Charles University. During the WW2 it was actually used as a seat of the SS with the nearby hospital Na Františku serving as a military hospital for the pilots of Luftwaffe.
The Butcher of Prague or The Blond beast are two (of many more) nicknames of Reinhard Heydrich, the new governor of Czech lands. He arrived to Prague in 1941 and immediately started persecutions of Czech political and intellectual personalities. He also gave orders to establish a ghetto and to start with the Jewish transports. He eventually paid for all what he did to Czechs in 1942 when two Czechoslovakian paratroopers from the resistance tried assassinate him. To know how it all happened you have to visit the church of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in New Town district. There is not only very interesting exhibition with many historical photographs, but still visible traces of the Nazi hunt.
The offices of Heydrich were situated in the Černín Palace, just above the Prague Castle complex. For some time Heydrich also did live here, but he later moved out of Prague to Panenské Břežany where he found a nice chateau for his family. The Černín Palace is the office of the minister of Foreign Affairs today.
The effort to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation in May 1945 is called the Prague Uprising. It all began on May 5th and lasted for three long days. About 30 thousands Czechs decided to fight with the Nazi army of 40 thousand. At the end, the Russian army marched into the city which meant the end of the war was getting close. Many historical buildings in the city centre were lost, and many of them on the Wenceslas Square for example. Czech casualties counted to almost 1700.
Old Town Square wasn’t spared either. We all are familiar the iconic view of the Town Hall, but not that many people realize that almost half of it is missing, actually burned down on May 8th, 1945.
Unfortunately, there’s so much left to say, but that would only make the article not bearable for reading. To find out more about WW2 in Prague, you’re welcome join me on my Prague WWII tour.

Travelling through Europe had always been a dream for me — not as part of a typical group tour with strict itineraries, but as a slow, meandering journey where I experience different countries getting a feel for the life in this continent.
This was my third trip… and towards the end of the trip I felt something very unexpected.
It was something that I’d never seen in travel vlogs or read in blogs that walk you through the adventures and experiences of Europe.
I was in Prague — it was my last day of the trip. I was walking over the beautiful bridge that connected old town with the extravagant Prague castle. The atmosphere was very lively, people walking around joyfully with live music being played at every corner. The weather was pleasant too and I was surrounded by the best landscape of river, mountain, and the beautiful Prague castle.
And yet — I wasn’t mind-blown.
I hate to admit it — but it all felt… normal. Not because the city was dull or unimpressive. On the contrary, Prague is one of the most beautiful places I have seen.
It was an amazing vibe, so much so that it made me feel guilty for not being surprised or mind blown by the ambience. An ambience that anyone would die to experience.
I realized this was happening to me because I had seen so many beautiful cities, wonderful architecture, and gorgeous landscapes that my brain had subconsciously normalized it.
My brain had adjusted itself to this new reality, and all the beautiful places had unknowingly become my new normal.
It was like eating your favorite ice cream every day only to find out that it doesn’t excite you anymore.
I learned something new that evening in Prague — even the best things or the best places we see or experience in life cease to excite you or offer surprise spark after a point.
It stops being special.
I had always dreamed of seeing the Swiss Alps, climbing the Florence cathedral dome, watching the sunset from the Prague castle — and all those things were truly amazing — but now that I was on the right side of all those experiences — everything else felt just normal.
In fact, when I look back at all achievements or special moments of my life — they all had eventually subsided and became mundane. When I got my first job, or started living in my dream city, or when I first started dating — all the feelings that excited me beyond imagination at first started to feel ordinary when they became reality.
Perhaps, the moment you accomplish your goals — your brain normalizes it. Sparks begin to fade; you aren’t surprised or mind blown anymore and it feels just routine.
Think for yourself, the life that you are living now, in this exact moment, was a life that your younger self would’ve dreamt of… and yet it feels just another day today.
Having said that — know that just because your brain normalizes something doesn’t mean it isn’t an achievement that you should stop being proud of. It simply means life has used that achievement as a conduit to move upward and you have outgrown yourself.
You now have bigger ambitions and bigger desires that excite you.
So — don’t dismiss your efforts or take your achievements for granted just because it feels normal now.
The younger version of me — the one who dreamt of travelling, doing everything from solo adventures to group outings — would be in awe of everything I’ve experienced today.

Žižkov, Anděl, Budějovická, Hradčanská, Staroměstská, Náměstí Míru, Háje…?
What do these weird Czech names mean and how does the area look like?
Prague is divided into districts, as you may already found out, those districts are divided into smaller parts with a specific name and also specific lifestyle you can experience.
During my Prague´s life I have lived in many various parts of the Prague city. I was also lucky enough to meet with wide range of experiences Prague can offer. After all I have decided to share my point of view and try to do a short, but hopefully an accurate review about those different districts.
Now, let´s come back to our — still for now — unknown Prague´s district called Prague 3 or in Czech Praha 3: if you are already in crazy mood of your Erasmus and want to practice Czech language, you nerd!
The district includes officially most of the cadastral area of Žižkov and parts of Vinohrady, Vysočany and Strašnice.
This district varies a lot as you move from one site to the oppossite one. Around “borders” with other districts, like Prague 2 (Vinohrady), Prague 10 (Strašnice) and Prague 9 (Vysočany) it lives their own life. Žižkov, the main part of P3, is less international than P2 or P1. You will also come across some really old and damaged buildings or even abandoned, but that´s what makes its spirit.
When I was going through this area I felt like in 80´s in Czech republic, life after the revolution.
It´s a calmer area, older Czech people are living here, but don´t worry, you won´t feel like in a retirement home. There are many cafes around and pubs as well. You should check out Café Pavlač, for instance!
Žižkov and P3, in general, offers a wide range of flats for rent. Flats are mainly less expensive, situated in older tall buildings — typicall for Czech republic. As I am mentioning in a Lifestyle paragraph, you will meet older people with their dogs, also some Gypsies, however you can still live in a luxurious flat and rock a world from Vítkov hill or Žižkov´s tower (highest peek in Prague by the way).
Itself is a bit different. I would express it as more Czech not so international part, a bit older, not playing a theatre for tourists. It is also more industrial with older buildings. Its highlight is certainly Vítkov park — if you want to feel a true history as a though guy, go there! At the hill took a place one of the main battles of Hussite wars. If you are still being nerdy, calm down, I have not forgotten, Žižkov is also an area of Franz Kafka — a famous Czech writer! By the way the name Žižkov comes from a name Jan Žižka, who was Czech general and Hussite leader, follower of Jan Hus — simply a though guy with one eye.
As you see above, Žižkov area also offers some architecture craziness as climbing babies at a tower, but also many interesting corners for you to observe in old Prague.

By Jacques Poitras
MATT WELCH WAS back in Prague for the Party at the End of the World. It was March 1, 1995, and the newspaper and the life he had created for himself were crumbling in the old cobblestone streets of the Czech capital. Prognosis, the English-language rag he had launched five years earlier with a few friends, had ceased publishing; tonight, a final, drunken bash would send it off into history.
Before heading to the party at Rock Club Bunkr, a bar housed in a former Communist nuclear bomb shelter, Welch, some of the other founders, and a few friends ducked into U Vejvodů, a traditional Czech pub. They reminisced about all the struggles going back to the beginning. Charlie Hornberger, the paper’s last editor-in-chief, described closing down the office. Welch shared anecdotes from the Budapest Business Journal, where he’d taken a job two months earlier. At their feet sat bundles of newspapers: the cover of the final issue of Prognosis showed a Communist-built apartment complex crumbling under the headline “The End.”
That possibility had been looming for months, even years. Prognosis had never made a single koruna in profit. Then again, that had never been the point. “Though it misfired and miscued on more than one occasion,” Welch wrote in a goodbye essay, “Prognosis at its full bloom was one of the most ferociously good newspapers any part of the world has ever seen. There is no satisfaction that can compare to this essential fact, nor any disappointment that can diminish its luster. Prognosis was, for nearly four full years, the exact sum of what the editorial staff imagined a great newspaper should be.”
And now it was over. Along with those defiant superlatives, Welch’s essay dished out an equal helping of self-pity. The other founders of the paper had postponed promising careers to embark on this adventure with him; “I, as a college dropout with little experience at anything, had nothing except an exaggerated sense of self-worth,” he wrote. “I am acutely aware that my life, such as it is right now, exists because of this newspaper and this experience called Prognosis. … Fact is, I now have something akin to a viable life, and the tangible source of that life is now dead.”
Prague was no longer the dreamy, mystical city Welch and his friends had discovered in 1990 as it emerged from the Cold War. The looseness of those post-Velvet Revolution days was fading, and the city was completing its transition from Soviet bloc outpost to Western destination. The Czechs were cashing in, hustlers now outnumbered hipsters, and the market was swallowing those, like Prognosis, who didn’t cut it.
Back home in the United States, Ken Layne, a former Prognosis writer, read Welch’s farewell column. The piece, he told me in 1995, “just shows Welch playing his favourite role: the bumbling can’t-get-my-shit-together-but-I-mean-well loser. … He refuses to take real responsibility for stuff falling apart. Prognosis failed because the founders had no interest or experience in running a successful business—and that’s what a newspaper is: a business. They thought business was bad and success was evil.”
ACROSS THE TABLE at U Vejvodů, Doug Arellanes, a former art director at the paper, pulled out an old letter. In 1990 Welch and two other founders — campus paper colleagues from the University of California at Santa Barbara — wrote to Arellanes from Prague. They shared the excitement of an idea: to launch an English-language newspaper in the Czech capital. “The key to all this I think is tapping as many good people as we can,” Christopher Scheer wrote in that letter, “not running this like a business but like a movement.” He would later explain: “No one starts a business with basically no money. We did. Lacking money, we damn well better have some love and elbow grease to carry us through. We were somewhat fatalistic, also, realizing that any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success.”
Welch had arrived in Eastern Europe that August to write a novel. When the other Americans who made up the future core of Prognosis pulled into Prague at the end of disparate backpacking trips, he was away in pre-war Yugoslavia; his pals discovered he had already established a profile. “He made quite an impression on this town,” Scheer wrote to Arellanes. “Women strewn in his wake, fans rumour-mongering about his eternally imminent return … It’s like Jesus!”
Anyone who met Matt Welch understood why. His long, blond hair, piercing dark eyes and affable demeanour often made him the center of attention. In Prague, he took to playing guitar for passers-by and spare change on the city’s postcard-perfect 700-year-old Charles Bridge. Back home in California, he had worked alongside the other Prognosis founders at the Daily Nexus, the University of California at Santa Barbara student paper, composing its weather forecasts as beat poetry. “He drank enormously, liked to wear dresses to work once a week and otherwise tried to create a mythos about himself,” Scheer would remember.
There was no shortage of talent among the founders of Prognosis, but Welch seemed to be the catalyst. He was “incredibly skilled at assembling myriad people to make his daydreams come to life,” according to Ken Layne. “I once told Matt the reason he’d never finish [writing] a book of fiction is because he’s too goddamn busy living a book of fiction.” If his life was, as he told it, going nowhere until he reached Prague, then the city offered the ideal setting for his apotheosis.
BESIDES THE STUNNING architecture, a rich cultural tradition, and women with beautiful Slavic eyes, Prague had Václav Havel. Czechoslovakia’s president knew about rising from despair to an exalted position. Havel, a playwright, had been jailed as a dissident by the Communists before the Velvet Revolution of November 1989 transformed him into head of state. He remained an idealist who talked of “living in truth” and building a civic society; for young Americans disenchanted with the Republicanism of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Havel added to Prague’s appeal. “My God, this is what politics should be,” John Allison, an early expat arrival, would remember thinking after seeing Havel’s February 1990 speech to the U.S. Congress. “This is my calling.” By the end of the year, Allison found himself working as the “American advisor” to Prague’s mayor.
Havel “did sort of underline the uniqueness of the place and time,” Christopher Scheer remembered. “He sort of encapsulated it. But he wasn’t the whole story, just a symptom, because every Czech we met seemed to have a wild story, to be oddly humble and intellectual at the same time. That’s why Havel could be president—because he represented a powerful strain in Czech culture.”
Welch came to idolize this rumpled philosopher-king who, indirectly, had made Prognosis possible. In his cramped apartment in an industrial section of Prague, a large poster of Havel occupied a place of honour on one wall. Someone had used a cigarette to burn out the eyes on another poster, of Václav Klaus, Czechoslovakia’s Thatcherite finance minister. You can deface anything on the walls, Welch once told a group of guests, except the Havel poster.
Besides Welch and Scheer, the other Americans who gathered at a pub in Prague in November 1990 to hash out the newspaper idea were Ben Sullivan, Laura Pitter, Jenny Ogar, and Lisa Frankenberg. They were all staying with Czech students Welch had befriended. “The next morning, we woke up hungover and had to decide if it was all just a beery fantasy,” Scheer recalled. “We decided tentatively that it wasn’t.”
The next evening, sober, they sat down and figured out how much money they could pool for the launch. Travellers’ cheques, credit card advances and anything they could sell were all put on the table. Everyone anted up except Lisa Frankenberg.
IN WELCH’S PROGNOSIS narrative, Lisa Frankenberg became the villain. Even in those early days, Scheer and others had doubts about Frankenberg, who had worked at the Nexus before leaving to get involved in the UCSB student government. Her unwillingness to put up money made them question her commitment to their Prague newspaper, but Welch, a friend, defended her. “She was not at all like our vibe,” Welch says. “We were pretty hippie and idealistic and journalism-based and easy to get along with. She was considerably more abrasive.” But he argued that “we need different types of personalities here, particularly on the business side, and maybe we can convert those negative characteristics into something we need.”
Today, the first few issues of the monthly Prognosis look amateurish, with unattractive fonts, awkward layout, and collegiate earnestness. But they were fresh and lively, and in the spring of 1991, with Prague’s expatriate population swelling, and thousands of English-speaking tourists on the way, they represented a triumph. The founders, their meager start-up funds supplemented with money from “investors” — a few well-heeled family friends back home — had waded through layers of left-over Communist bureaucracy just to launch the paper. The first edition, “zero issue,” was snapped up by expats and backpackers starved for something to read in English. The paper would go on to chronicle everything from the sweeping privatization of state institutions, to the growth of the drug trade and prostitution, to the establishment of an Andy Warhol Museum in the Slovak village where the artist’s mother was born. “We wanted to create something that had never existed, in a place where it was impossible to imagine such a thing existing,” Welch says.
Frankenberg soon began to have doubts. In charge of distribution and advertising, she heard the same comments over and over when she tried to sell subscriptions and ad space to the growing foreign business community. Prognosis was fun, but her prospective clients wanted serious business news to help them understand this lucrative new market. They also wanted it fast: a monthly paper didn’t provide immediacy in a quickly changing economy. And the sometimes arch, collegiate tone of the paper turned them off.
In an interview in 1995, Frankenberg described how no one at Prognosis seemed concerned about what she was hearing. “The attitude was, ‘We’re having fun, we’re enjoying this, why should we change?’” she told me. There was no business plan for growth, and no budget forecasting revenues and expenses. “Very clearly, the response [from the others] was, ‘We’re not a business, we’re a newspaper.’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute, a newspaper is a business.’”
Frankenberg’s worries were compounded the day Alan Levy visited the Prognosis office to offer his services. Levy, a 59-year-old American journalist, had covered the Prague Spring, Alexander Dubček’s 1968 attempt to democratize Communism from within. When Soviet tanks arrived to crush Dubček’s experiment, Levy was expelled. He lived in Vienna for 21 years, moving back shortly after the Velvet Revolution, and his book about 1968, So Many Heroes, became a must-read for expats. He proposed writing a column for Prognosis, a series of profiles of interesting Czechs and expatriates.
The founders turned him down. “We didn’t want to publish an archetypal expat-freelancer just because he had ‘clips,’” Welch later wrote. “I wasn’t at that fateful meeting, but apparently he came on strong and condescending, and I’m sure we were more than just a little defensive about people questioning our credentials and telling us what we should cover. So with those prejudices, we read his stuff and thought it wouldn’t fit into our Mission-from-God approach.”
Welch came to see it as a defining moment for the young paper: “We finally had confidence enough in what we were to reject an over-qualified representative of what we didn’t want to be,” Welch said. Frankenberg would later call her Prognosis colleagues “callow” for not hiring Levy. “I was flabbergasted that anyone would turn away such a gifted writer and I expressed my apologies to Alan,” she wrote years later. Frankenberg was now so frustrated that she considered packing it in and resuming her studies back in the States in the fall.
But in July 1991, a newspaper distributor working for Frankenberg had a chance meeting with a Texas businessman, Monroe Luther, who was in Prague inking deals. Luther told Frankenberg he might invest in Prognosis, but he wanted his money put to good use: he wanted a more business-oriented weekly, and suggested she come back with him in two days with a proposal to transform the paper.
According to Matt Welch and Christopher Scheer, Frankenberg and her philosophical soulmate in the Prognosis business office, Kent Hawryluk, demanded a radical change of editorial direction—more serious and business-friendly—without mentioning Luther’s possible infusion of cash. (Frankenberg disputed this account when I interviewed her in 1995, saying she was upfront about Luther’s investment offer and that the desire for a revamp came from him.) Frankenberg and Hawryluk also wanted to be equal partners in the business, a status denied to them because they had invested no money. Otherwise, they said, they’d walk. “Man, were we agonized,” Welch says. “We definitely needed them, and they did stuff we couldn’t imagine doing ourselves, but there was something pretty gross and not trustworthy about playing ultimatum games with an idealistic venture started by people of good faith. So ultimately, we said no.”
A few days later, Frankenberg and Hawryluk resigned from Prognosis and persuaded Luther to use his money to help them launch a business-oriented weekly called The Prague Post. It hit the streets in October, 1991, its early issues were hopelessly dull in design, style and content. But the paper knew how to sell itself: the Post played to the business community with credulous coverage of finance and investment, and bought prime space on billboards, branding itself a serious player in the marketplace and selling a lot of advertising. “Their initial billboards cost more than we spent in the first nine months of our entire operation,” Scheer recalled.
Alan Levy was hired as titular editor-in-chief of The Prague Post. “We are living in the Left Bank of the ’90s,” he declared in a column in the inaugural issue, alluding to Hemingway’s Paris. “For some of us, Prague is Second Chance City; for others a new frontier where anything goes, everything goes, and, often enough, nothing works. Yesterday is long gone, today is nebulous, and who knows about tomorrow, but, somewhere within each of us, we all know that we are living in a historic place at a historic time.”
The Prognosis founders were hardly jealous of the Post’s content—they rolled their eyes at Levy’s prose, and they wouldn’t miss Frankenberg and Hawryluk—but the pair took their advertising and distribution contacts with them. Suddenly, Prognosis was without a business staff, and without the network the pair had assembled to sell the newspaper in an often-baffling post-Communist environment. “It was like a jackhammer in the nuts,” Welch says. “It totally drained the joy out of the situation.”
Welch, Scheer, and the others responded by taking Prognosis biweekly and working even harder. “We did not, however, try to beat the Post at their own game,” Scheer said. “Arrogant or not, we decided very consciously to keep trying to put out the newspaper that we wanted to put out and not just try to be a local version of The Wall Street Journal.”
THEY STILL HAD HYPE on their side. For foreign reporters dropping in on Prague to profile the growing expat community, the grimy, cluttered Prognosis office was an essential stop. The paper represented the kind of journalism they secretly wanted to practice: fun, smart, brashly principled. Any feature piece on the self-exiled, twentysomethings of Prague inevitably included the same tropes: the American-owned New York Pizza restaurant; the mayor’s “American advisor,” John Allison, who had moved onto a job in Havel’s office in the majestic Castle overlooking the city; Laundry Kings, the American-owned, first-ever self-serve laundromat in Prague—and Prognosis. “It’s practically impossible to live here for any length of time and not be interviewed by some major paper or broadcast network, adding another level of absurdity to what is already a pretty ridiculous existence,” Welch would write. “All this silliness has not exactly hurt our paper, my career or my swelling ego needs.”
In July 1992 Welch was the central character in a lengthy article in Details magazine that many expats credited with single-handedly spinning the Prague hype-meter into the stratosphere. Using Prognosis as a framing device, writer Henry Copeland portrayed Prague as a hedonistic haven for a new lost generation. Welch and others would mock the article, particularly a quotation uttered by one Prognosis writer: “In Prague, everything is so open that you can re-invent yourself every day.” Yet a copy of that issue, preserved like new, was tucked away in Welch’s flat, where I discovered it during the two months I spent subletting his place.
In retrospect, that Details piece represented the high-water mark for expatriate Prague. The same summer it was published, reality began to intrude on the fairy tale: Czechoslovakia’s first full-scale elections, in June 1992 produced a political schism in the federation. Václav Klaus, leader of the Civic Democratic Party, triumphed in the Czech parliament, while the victory of a pro-independence party in Slovakia threatened to split the country. Klaus, a bottom-line man in favour of rapid privatization and economic restructuring, had no qualms about saying goodbye to the Slovaks: the poorer, slower-to-modernize, more rural part of the federation was a drag on his ideological plans. As president, Václav Havel sought to preserve the federation because of the multi-ethnic ideal it represented, but even Havel’s moral authority could not contain the forces that had been unleashed. On New Year’s Day, 1993, Czechoslovakia, the country that had survived Nazism and Communism, the two great totalitarian plagues of the twentieth century, ceased to exist.
Havel was soon chosen as president of the new Czech Republic and Klaus became its prime minister. Prognosis would call them “those wild and warring poster boys of the modern Czech soul.” Klaus, the no-nonsense, get-things-done manager in a hurry to downsize the machinery of government, was the efficient administrator, while Havel, the philosopher and moralist, was perfect for the role of symbolic head of state. They would clash repeatedly: Havel felt Klaus forgot the human element in governing; Klaus found Havel’s dreamy idealism impractical. “The advocate of non-political politics met a consummate political animal,” Havel’s biographer later wrote.
The schism echoed Prague’s expat newspaper war: Prognosis, though struggling financially, continued to strive for a journalistic ideal akin to Havel’s “living in truth” as it chronicled the changes in Czech society. The Post, Klaus-like in its pragmatism, prospered by playing to the market, giving the big-spending expat business community what it wanted. Prognosis was still cooler, but like Havel, it was no longer invincible.
THE DETAILS STORY drew me to Prague as I fled a recession-wracked newspaper industry in Canada. But by the time I arrived in January 1993, the city was re-inventing itself so quickly that it was no longer the Capital of Dreams sketched by the magazine just six months earlier. The cost of two expat staples, beer and apartment rent, both ridiculously cheap by U.S. standards in early 1992, were creeping up as the market adjusted to the city’s destination status. The talk now was less about Havel, the playwright president, and more about Klaus, the economic guru whose reforms were seen as a textbook example of how to move from Communism to capitalism.
Visiting reporters had also discovered a new source of expat wisdom. They now often visited the offices of The Prague Post to interview Lisa Frankenberg. Across town at Prognosis, meanwhile, the founders, exhausted by the grind of publishing and the battle with the Post, turned over senior editorial positions to newcomers and moved into writing positions, or onto new adventures. Welch relocated to Bratislava, the capital of newly independent Slovakia, to run the paper’s bureau there, while the new managers grappled with how to give the operation some much-needed stability.
The new publisher, Erica Breth, discovered there was still no real budget, business plan, or bookkeeping. (Scheer, when I interviewed him in 1995, disputed the idea that the founders had ignored the business side; they “worried enormously” about it, he said, but “none of it made our business sense any more acute, none of it made us more organized, none of it brought us big investors.”) More money from “investors” back in the U.S., including wealthy liberal philanthropist Helen Bing, couldn’t erase the red ink. The journalism remained solid, and Breth and her fellow managers stayed one step ahead of invoices from printers, phone companies and other suppliers. But Prognosis was sputtering financially.
Several staff members left in the summer and fall of 1993. Some, like me, were lured by jobs back home; most feared the paper’s demise was a matter of time. On a fundraising trip to the United States, Breth made the rounds of foundations and other do-gooders who had endowed the paper in the early days. But the Czech Republic’s much-publicized economic success meant, perversely, that the novelty of a scrappy little paper in Prague was wearing off. The money Breth gathered in early 1994 was quickly used, all at once, to pay off the paper’s printers, who hadn’t collected for months and were refusing to roll the presses.
Matt Welch wouldn’t give in. He left the bureau in Bratislava and returned to Prague, where he and Ben Sullivan, another founder, stepped back into senior editorial jobs under John Allison, who became editor-in-chief. “I still recall that the engine that was the news desk was being fueled almost single-handedly by Matt and John Allison, who both toiled mightily to put out a newspaper,” reporter Logan Mabe would say.
Welch was still making myths: Prognosis could rise again. In May, 1994, a Dutch businessman, Harmen Smink, injected cash by buying 51 per cent of the paper. Welch contacted a handful of Prognosis alumni in California, among them Ken Layne, and appealed to them to return to Prague. “He had these various godlike attributes attached to each of us,” Layne told me in 1995, “and he figured he could just play God and assemble a new group of ‘founders’ that would continue the legacy, as it were, and maybe put some fire and guts back into it.” Others were wary, but Layne accepted an offer to become editor-in-chief—until he learned at the last minute that he would not have the authority Welch had promised him. He was tempted, he said, to fly to Prague “just to beat the shit out of Matt and leave him for dead with his fucking guitar rammed up his hippy ass.” In Layne’s place, Charlie Hornberger, a Nexus pal of Welch, took over.
Smink’s money allowed Prognosis to move into better offices and go weekly with full-colour covers. Newsstand sales jumped, but advertising did not. Within a few weeks the problems began anew: Smink’s hard currency seemed to be evaporating. It would later emerge that the paper’s business manager was defrauding the paper, funneling money into her own private ventures. By the time anyone noticed, it was too late.
The newspaper’s philosophical guru up in Prague Castle was in no better state. As his popularity plummeted, Václav Havel mused to one interviewer about how he looked forward to leaving the presidency and becoming a simple pensioner. The economy, not ethics and morals, drove the agenda in Prague, and Prime Minister Václav Klaus was the man of the moment. He had a budget surplus forecast for 1995, the lowest inflation rate in the former Soviet bloc, and a jobless rate below four per cent. At the end of 1994, Klaus mocked Havel’s idea of the president delivering a “State of the Nation” address to Parliament — then delivered one himself. Poll after poll showed Czechs considered Havel the more principled of the two men, but they trusted Klaus to run the country.
On New Years’ Day, 1995, Klaus gave a look-ahead interview to the country’s first private TV station, Nova. In a clear attempt to eclipse the president, it was broadcast at the same time as Havel’s New Year’s address on state television. Of Havel’s remarks, Prognosis reported: “Far from an optimist in his days of waning popularity and influence, Havel could apparently muster only the dark conclusion that ‘Not everything is lost yet.’”
The president might as well have been talking about the expat newspaper inspired by his idealism. As the financial situation worsened, Welch accepted a job at the Budapest Business Journal. Smink tried to buy out the remaining 49 per cent of the paper still owned by Welch and the founders; when they balked, he cut off salaries and shopped his controlling shares to potential buyers, including The Prague Post. A gossip column in the February 21 issue of Prognosis ended prophetically with a comment that “all things come to an end sometime.” The following week, the founders decided to maintain their paper’s dignity. They closed it down.
MATT WELCH SAT down with a bottle of wine at his desk in Budapest at the end of February 1995 and wrote a piece for the final issue of Prognosis that would be headlined “A Long Goodbye to the Paper I Loved Best.”
“We were right all along,” Welch wrote, “if excessively stupid and self-indulgent in the deployment.” He expressed pride in the legacy Prognosis would leave—in particular the journalism education it gave to many young Czechs and Slovak interpreters and translators who became talented reporters for local media organizations—but he also mourned: this was the piece in which he declared that “the tangible source of [his] life is now dead,” tying his own fate to that of the daydream he would soon bury. “What I was expressing there,” he says now, “was a kind of gratitude for having been able to experience something that made me at least quasi-presentable to the world of journalism, and a melancholy for that beautiful and helpful thing being dead.”
Lisa Frankenberg told me she felt no sense of triumph at the demise of Prognosis, even though it gave her Prague Post a freer hand in Prague’s English-language media market. She claimed to be moved by Welch’s coda. “There were probably only a handful of people who read that through to the end. I read it. I read it to the very end,” she said. Winning the expat newspaper war was “very weird and sad. It was a very weird day. We knew it was coming for a long time.”
One night in May 1995, as the spring air brought with it the promise of another beautiful summer in Prague, Frankenberg took a stroll on the Charles Bridge with Monroe Luther, the owner of the Post. They talked about the paper’s prospects: its circulation was rising, and a growing number of English-speaking Czechs read it. “It’s a successful business,” Frankenberg told me at the time, though she refused to reveal if it was profitable.
Suddenly Frankenberg saw a familiar figure with a guitar, blond hair waving in the breeze as he strummed on the bridge. “Hey, Matt!” she yelled. He smiled, answered, “Hey, Frankenberg.” Matt Welch was back in town, and could still muster a smile for his former rival.
Frankenberg and Luther kept walking. “Someday in the future, I’d like to sit down with him and have a coffee or a beer and talk things out,” she told me in 1995. “But it takes time. It was probably like part of him dying when Prognosis died.”
They never had that coffee. Welch eventually returned to the United States, where, he says, he parlayed what he called the “quasi-presentable” reputation he earned in Prague into a career in journalism. The Prague Post continues to publish digitally, though it shed its print edition in 2013. Welch says he holds no grudge against Frankenberg. “Why? Competition’s good, man! It made both papers better. And because I, unlike her, can look at myself in the mirror every night before going to sleep without so much as a twinge of doubt of how I comported myself professionally in my early twenties. She won the battle, for which she deserves real credit. But history will not remember her paper nearly the same way, and that just makes me smile and smile.”
IN 1995, MANY Prognosis staffers and alumni were less sanguine. True, the city had become faster, harder, more expensive and less forgiving: the free market that had made Prognosis possible had killed it. But it was tempting to conclude Welch and the others had squandered what they had built—a newspaper that everyone who worked there had come to consider their own.
“These American kids start the first English-language newspaper. … It can’t help but thrive, right?” Welch’s friend, Ken Layne, told me in an e-mail in 1995. “It sputters along for several years, getting a million dollars in free press, no business plan, no financial plan, no discipline, just bumbling along, just like all of Prague is doing. And just like the fucking Communists, Prognosis is living off subsidies,” a reference to the money from relatives and foundations in the United States. “Meanwhile, the Czechs figure it all out. They toss away a lifetime of anti-capitalist bullshit and turn Prague into a fucking money machine. Everybody figures out how to run a business, how to make cash, how to succeed — everybody but these American kids who refuse to even acknowledge the need for money, for success.
“If Lisa Frankenberg is your villain,” Layne added, “you’ve bought into the biggest piece of fabricated history ever. If they had figured out how to use Lisa’s smarts … Prognosis would be a thriving media empire today instead of a dead newspaper fondly remembered by fifty people. The results speak for themselves. Lisa is no monster. A hundred other people have felt the same way about the half-ass manner in which Prognosis was run.”
When I remind Layne of those comments almost two decades later, he explains that “one of my habits of my youth was to get good and drunk and pissed off while typing. It was, I guess, my literary style of the era.” In 1995, he says, he was still bitter about his aborted return to Prague. “I was supposed to be editor of a paper I loved in the Czech Republic, and instead I was drifting around.”
Layne still doesn’t blame Frankenberg for the paper’s demise: she left in 1991, and the paper took another four years to fold, he points out, plenty of time to have turned things around. But he is more forgiving of Welch and company. “While I’ve lost touch with all but a dozen or so of the Prognosis gang, those dozen people remain some of my best friends,” he says. “The group of Californians and Czechs who started up that paper did a pretty good job with intolerable circumstances.” Even in 1995, at his most frustrated, Layne said of them, “they are good people, and that Prague experience remains incredibly significant. It reverberates through every part of my life.”
CHRISTOPHER SCHEER’S FATHER, journalist Robert Scheer, urged the Prognosis founders in 1994 “to just become an Internet newspaper,” Welch says, “which would have been way ahead of the curve.” Instead, because the paper died at almost the precise moment the Internet became a mass phenomenon, there is no online archive or digital database of its five-year run. Former employees now speak of a complete set of printed issues the way one recounts an urban legend: the full run is always sitting in the basement of the friend of a friend, just out of reach. So Prognosis, as an iteration of young, earnest, idealistic journalism, cannot be considered in its entirety, but only in pieces. A virtual collection of yellowed issues lies scattered across the globe, a notional scrapbook of clippings, impressions, half-memories and fading photographs.
In the twenty years since its demise, my picture of Prognosis has evolved from a lost opportunity into something else. As a bit player, I too was frustrated to see it fold. Today, I no longer imagine an alternate history in which Prognosis survived the nineties: I just marvel at the audacity of its brief, improbable existence. During one gloomy period in 1993, Christopher Scheer wrote in a memo to the staff that the paper was not “a normal institution. … Stability is not its primary, overriding goal. Those who seem to wish Prognosis was some great gleaming ship of stable corporate love — including myself at many an exhausted moment — would not want to work at such a place.” The founders of Prognosis gave us a life-changing experience; they didn’t owe us permanence.
Any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success, Scheer had said. And so the sharp edges of the picture soften to something else: a moment, ephemeral but real, in the dusty swirl of post-1989 Central Europe. Lyle Zimskind, a managing editor of the Czech edition of Esquire, would remember Prognosis as “chaotically managed” but “livelier” than the Post — a victory by any measure, except that of for-profit survival.
In his 1990 letter, Scheer had advocated “not running this like a business but like a movement.” And every movement runs its course. Welch made not only his daydreams come to life, but those of every other expat who saw their work — their words, their whimsy, their passion — on those pages. “Prognosis was an expression of pure newspaper romanticism,” he says. “The whole thing was an expression of love for the form.”
“The paper failed,” writer Logan Mabe would conclude, “but it wasn’t a failure.”
IN LATE 2011, Welch, now the editor-in-chief of Reason, a Washington libertarian magazine, returned to Prague to attend the funeral of his idol, Václav Havel. Havel’s English translator, Paul Wilson, had secured him a seat inside St. Vitus Cathedral, the imposing Gothic structure at Prague Castle that dominates the city skyline.
Outside the gates, hundreds of thousands normally taciturn Czechs were mourning their hero. They were part of the West now, part of the European Union and of NATO, and though Havel’s popularity had faded before he left the presidency in 2003, his reputation for principle was intact — unlike that of his rival, Klaus, whose government was eventually tainted by corruption scandals. And so, though the end of Communism had produced many complications and disappointments, the citizens of Prague crowded the streets for Havel’s funeral procession, wrapping the city in the same atmosphere of possibility they created in 1989.
In a piece for Reason’s website, Welch reflected on what Havel had inspired, not in Welch himself, but in the Czech capital. “From the Velvet Revolution through at least 1991, and in many (though lesser) respects for years after, Prague was alive with rediscovery and experimentation in the exciting, difficult, anarchic interlude between Communism and its built-out replacement,” he wrote. “More than mere nostalgia for a limited era of time (one I was fortunate enough to participate in), that same spirit of, well, love, or at least its handmaiden decency, has never really gone away.”
The newspaper was never far from Welch’s mind during his quick return to Prague. “That forty-eight hours I spent there was a profound moment, one I absolutely lived up to by drinking until 5 a.m. the night before the funeral with a bunch of ex-Prognosis comrades, and then vomiting inside the castle after the religious ceremony, and also, again, under the Charles Bridge on the walk back,” he told me. “Friends from New York told me to do it right, in their honor, and so I did.”
“Prague is beautiful like an insecure woman,” Prognosis staffer Kate Sullivan once wrote. “It doesn’t seem to realize the crazy extent of its beauty; it doesn’t notice the effect it has on people.” But everyone who ever worked at the paper realized it. They still do.
“To this day,” Welch says, “I reject the term ‘the real world,’ because my feeling is that we should all strive for the surrealism that we were able to enjoy in early-nineties Prague.”

Disclaimer: This whole article was written under the optics of a budget traveler. If you are a deep-pocketed luxury jet-setter and frequent guest of Ritz, chances are your perceptions are completely different.
In this article, I will list 3 reasons why Prague disappointed me, so you can avoid it.
Prague is one of the most visited cities in Europe. With 8.8 million tourists per year, it receives more visitors than entire countries like Tunisia or Brazil (8.3 and 6.6 million respectively).
The Czech capital is known for its good beer and cheap costs. Especially for young tourists.
While they surely produce some great Pilsen (beer type named after the Czech city of Plzeň), I dispute the idea that Prague is a bargain, based in the 3 points below.
The hype made scammers flourish in the city. Unless you developed some serious budget-traveling skills (you can get some in my last book), you risk being ripped off on a weekend.
The old town of Prague is full of scams that are rare in eastern or central European capitals like Warsaw. Talking about comparisons, in my experience, the cost-benefit of visiting Prague is far worse than other…

Our experiences traveling through Prague
Prague is the complete opposite of Berlin. While Berlin is modern and hip, Prague still maintains its old town charms and traditional values. At first glance, Prague appears to be frozen in time thanks to its beautiful old buildings, castles and town squares that have survived the past few world wars.
However, after delving deeper into the city we soon realised that the entire Old Town and Castle Quarter were populated by tourists. Most locals in these areas were people working in the tourism industry and shop retailers. I have mixed feelings about Prague. I may be slightly biased by the fact that we both fell ill for two whole days in Prague, but mostly I think it’s because unlike Berlin, we didn't really get to experience a lot (if any) of the local scenes in Prague.
CONS:
PROS:
Having visited 4 countries already as I write this, Prague stands out as the most distinct and beautiful old city. The Old Town (Stare Mesto)is the centerpiece of Prague, intact with beautiful heritage buildings exudes an air of romance at nightfall when the orange hued street lamps lights up the streets of Old Town. Walking around Old Town Square in the evening felt abit like being in a fairytale.
Also for the opera and theatre fans, the tickets to a show were very reasonable (approx 10–15euros) compared to Vienna. We didn’t manage to catch a show, however reading online it would appear that Prague offers a good and cheaper alternative for classical music plays.
Castle Quarter (Hradcany) is a Unesco heritage site known for Prague Castle located in this area and the surrounding sights which are packed with Czech history. Castle Quarter dominates the skyline of Prague as it is located on a hill on the other side of River Vltava. Aside from the multitude of historical museums, cathedral and castle buildings to visit, Castle Quarter also offers the best vantage point for photography. Get yourself a combi ticket at Prague Castle to get the most out of your visit. Some of the notable mentions were captured in the photos below.
Unfortunately our appetites have shrunk in Prague. As mentioned earlier, we fell sick and were homebound for two whole days out of our week long duration in Prague. That could be the cause of our lack of foodie finds, but generally Prague didn’t impress us much in the food aspect. The foodie scene was not as evolved as its neighbouring cities, so fusion or international cuisines were not as plentiful. Their traditional meals are generally meat and potatoes with not much greens on the plate. I’m all for trying new food and traditional cuisines, but I can now conclude that Prague’s traditional fares are just not for me.

My brother and I decided to establish the headquarters of our tech company in Prague. It was the best decision we’ve ever made.
People who have visited Prague before can confirm that it’s an astonishing city with impressively clean streets, stunning architecture, diverse cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife. But most people are only now starting to realize that Prague is also a hidden gem for tech companies.
To understand why Prague is just starting to flourish, you have to look back more than 100 years and understand a bit of Czech history.
Throughout its history, the Czech Republic has always been a prominent economic player in Europe. In the early 20th century, it was actually an industrial powerhouse and held 10th place in the world industrial production. It was only after World War 2 when the Czech Republic became occupied by the Soviet Union and then ruled by communism, that its economy started to halter.
However, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully ended communism, the Czech Republic reestablished democracy and a market economy. Since then (over the last 30 years) the Czech economy has been growing at an impressive pace and it now proudly produces the most GDP per capita in comparison to all other post-communist countries.
Prague also has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, at just 1.3%.
Looking back at the last 30 years and seeing how much progress the Czech Republic has made leaves me and everybody living in Prague excited about the future.
The Czech Republic boasts a great education system.
I myself spent a few years in the Czech Republic during high school and can confirm it from first-hand experiences. When I was transferring over from my school in the US, I had to spend the whole summer catching up on algebra, physics, and chemistry just so that I could join the same age students and didn’t have to stay a year back.
Getting a university education in the Czech Republic is free, which gives the opportunity for everyone to enroll and lifts the education level across the whole population. The free education system also attracts many foreign students who wouldn’t have been able to afford an education at home.
Czech universities also have very high-quality computer science and mathematics programs, which serves as a solid foundation for future software engineers. The mathematics programs are especially key for those students who later on pursue careers in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
HackerRank, a California-based service that runs tests for software engineers, ranked Czech engineers 2nd in the world in mathematical challenges which reflect their skill in functional programming.
The Czech engineers ranked 9th in the world overall. The US ranked 13th.
If you’re reading this article and you’re sitting in a large US metropolitan area, you’re probably used to long commute times and have just accepted traffic as part of your life, as I did when I was living in the Bay Area. Prague doesn’t have this issue.
Its public transport system is ranked 5th in the world and is used by over two thirds of the city’s population. It has an affordable, yet sophisticated train, metro, tram and bus system, allowing you to comfortably get around the city within minutes.
Prague is located in the heart of Europe and has direct flight connections to all other major European cities such as Paris, London, or Amsterdam. Flight times are all under 2h and usually cost between $50 — $250 round trip.
Prague is gradually becoming a global metropolis and is catching up to cities like Paris and Amsterdam, however, it is still incomparable when it comes to prices and is, therefore, a great place to work and live. You can afford to live a high standard of life with an average Prague salary, especially if you’re working in tech.
I ran a price comparison of San Francisco vs. Prague (my two hometowns) and this is where we’ve landed (1):
It’s also tough to get bored in Prague. It’s an energetic city with endless cool events to attend. If you’re into contemporary art exhibits, prosecco festivals, local food markets, underground techno raves, or just into chilling in the park enjoying the castle view, you’ve got it.
Over recent years, Prague has attracted a lot of foreigners and now has a thriving expat community, which makes up more than 25% of Prague’s workforce. Plenty of Americans and Brits have decided to move here as well and surprisingly in some districts you now hear English on the streets and at cafes more often than Czech.
We’re witnessing the Prague startup scene flourish.
Just over the past few months, we’ve seen Prague startup productboard raise a $45,000,000 Series B round led by Sequoia Capital, Twisto, an emerging fintech startup raise $15,000,000 and Rossum, a startup extracting data from invoices and documents using machine learning, raise $4,500,000.
If you’re just launching your tech startup and are having trouble with hiring the right technical talent, or are shocked by the high prices and burn rate you’ll have in an oversaturated tech hub like Silicon Valley, you might want to consider making Prague your new home.
Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I’ll be happy to give you tips and tricks for Prague. I’ve been here for almost 4 years and moving here was the best decision I’ve made.

Southeast Asia is so much popular and we can read about those ideal places for nomadic lifestyle in almost every second interview with some digital nomad. It has been many years like that but today more digital nomads are tired of Asia and want to try something else.
Why not?
Location independent lifestyle is not about living in Asia.
I know, South East Asia is perfect. It is so cheap! It is fun! There are beaches! You will escape from stress…
It might be true, but why should I stay there for the rest of my life? Yeah, let's go there, experience that, but why settle there?
Digital nomads can work from anywhere, so they tend to move every month or two months. Their “moving out/in factor” is very deep inside of them.
For those who are from Australia or New Zeland it is obvious that they prefer Indonesia, Malaysia or South East Asia. But what about US citizens? Coming to Europe is not hard for them. They ask for a Shengen visa and can travel within all EU members during the period of 3 months.
Many of them know right now and the word of mouth is getting spread out.
This is just a beginning. Let's dig deeper why you will meet more digital nomads in Prague nowadays than ever before. Prague is indeed becoming one of the most popular hub for digital nomads.
The climate in the Czech Republic is very nice for all three season (spring, summer, autumn). Of course most digital nomads are coming during summer. Winter is not a favourite season while you are in the city. Anyway the location of Prague can guarantee very pleasant weather conditions.
Moreover there are no earthquakes or any other dangerous nature occasions.
Prague's architecture is amazing. Many says that Prague is the heart of Europe and the most beautiful city in the whole Europe. And it is true! If you don't believe me, you should google some images from Prague.
The Czech Republic lies in the middle of Europe, you can decide if it is eastern or western Europe. Don't forget bring this topic when you sit with a beer with some Czech. You will have fun, that's for sure :-)
The infrastructure in Prague is very modern. The transportation is easy and as a english speaking traveller you won't have a bigger problems.
Yeah, we do speak english. It is not our official language, but most young people can speak very good english. You can meet lots of foreigners in Prague as well.
When you are lost, you simply ask for a direction in the nearest shop and will get an answer.
There are many coworking spaces in Prague. You can choose if you prefer bigger space or maybe smaller coworking.
The price is around 10 Euro/1 hour or 130 Euro/month.
I can recommend you Locus Coworking or Impact Hub.
Plenty of events are going on every day in Prague. Either business's topics or topics for self-improvement. The good thing about coworking spaces in Prague is that they are not just for work but they really connect you with other interesting people. The staff do lots of events, so make sure you will check them out.
You can find many cultural events in the city as well.
Prague is a place where to party, that is for sure. Prague is very famous because travellers go party here. Some come to Prague just to party. I am serious!
Well, if you come here, it is definitely recommended to experience that. The buzz is cheap and there are tons of clubs.
Work hard, party hard!

PRAGUE
The City of a Hundred Spires: My Unforgettable Journey to Prague
As I stepped off the train at Prague’s main station, the crisp Czech air hit me like a slap in the face, jolting me awake from the long journey. I had dreamed of visiting this enchanting city for years, and finally, here I was, ready to immerse myself in its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant culture. Little did I know, Prague had a way of weaving itself into the fabric of my soul, leaving an indelible mark that would stay with me forever.
My journey began on a chilly autumn morning, as I wandered through the winding streets of the Old Town, taking in the breathtaking views of the city’s iconic landmarks. The Charles Bridge, with its 30 statues of saints, stretched majestically across the Vltava River, while the majestic St. Vitus Cathedral pierced the sky like a shard of glass. Every step revealed a new treasure: a quaint café, a street performer, or a hidden alleyway that seemed to whisper secrets of the past.
As I explored the city, I stumbled upon a small, family-owned bakery, tucked away in a quiet corner of the Jewish Quarter. The aroma of freshly baked trdelník wafted out, enticing me to enter. Inside, I found a cozy haven, filled with the warmth of traditional Czech hospitality. The owner, a kind-eyed woman named Marie, offered me a taste of her famous pastry, and as I bit into the sweet, flaky treat, I felt a deep connection to the city and its people.
Prague, it seemed, was a city of layers, each one revealing a new story, a new secret, or a new surprise. As I delved deeper, I discovered the city’s complex history, marked by periods of grandeur and turmoil. I visited the Prague Castle, a sprawling complex of palaces, churches, and gardens, which had witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the birth of new ideas, and the struggles of a nation. The castle’s grandeur was humbling, yet, as I walked through its empty corridors, I felt a sense of intimacy, as if the stones themselves were sharing their stories with me.
One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, I found myself at a traditional Czech pub, surrounded by locals and travelers alike. The air was thick with the smell of roasted meat and freshly brewed beer, and the sound of laughter and music filled the room. I struck up a conversation with a young Czech musician, named Jakub, who shared with me the city’s vibrant arts scene, from classical music to contemporary theater. As we talked, I realized that Prague was not just a city; it was a living, breathing entity, pulsing with creativity and energy.
As the days passed, I fell deeper in love with Prague. I wandered through the city’s many parks and gardens, each one a tranquil oasis in the midst of the bustling metropolis. I visited the famous John Lennon Wall, now a symbol of peace and freedom, where I added my own message to the thousands of words and images that covered the wall. And I marveled at the city’s stunning architecture, a blend of Gothic, Renaissance, and Art Nouveau styles, which seemed to defy gravity and push the boundaries of human creativity.
But Prague was not just a city of grand monuments and historic landmarks; it was also a city of quiet moments, of intimate connections, and of personal discoveries. As I sat in a small café, watching the snowflakes fall gently outside, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. It was as if the city had wrapped its arms around me, holding me close, and whispering words of comfort and reassurance.
As I prepared to leave Prague, I felt a pang of sadness, knowing that I would soon be leaving behind this enchanting city and its people. But I also knew that a part of me would remain, forever connected to the city’s spirit, its energy, and its beauty. Prague had taught me that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, there is always beauty to be found, always a story to be told, and always a connection to be made.
As I boarded the train to leave, I glanced out the window, watching as the city’s spires and towers disappeared into the distance. I smiled, knowing that I would return, that I would once again wander the streets of Prague, and that I would continue to uncover the secrets and stories that this incredible city had to offer. For in Prague, I had discovered a part of myself, a part that I never knew existed, and a part that I would carry with me for the rest of my life.

It seems illogical that an introvert should love going out. And yet we do. However, we often go out for reasons contrary to why extrovert’s head to the nearest bar. It is not a journey to meet someone or get social, it is a time to engage in a solitary activity and dive into the inner world of thought, perceptions and sensations. Whenever an extrovert goes out to make a new acquaintance, an introvert will often prefer to read a book, do some writing or appreciate the multitude of tastes that his food offers him.
The Internet abounds in advice on how to dine like an introvert. Some of it is quite amusing, like:
While you may choose to follow or disregard this advice, I suggest you head to a cafe anyway. Here’s my list of cafes in Prague where you can have a decent cup of coffee and be left alone, if that’s what your heart desires.
Mama coffee
I found Mama coffee by chance. I wanted to have a look at a New Town Tower and followed the Vodičkova street heading to Vaclavske namesti. On my right I saw big steel-framed windows and cosy tables inside, so I gave it a chance. At the time I was starting to get desperate about finding decent coffee in Prague.
This place is more than simply good coffee in the city center (and believe me when I say finding good coffee is not as easy as it might seem). It has a great vibe due to the abundance of green plants, vintage furniture and photographs on the walls. It was there that my husband and I bought two framed photographs by František Beneš — a mysterious Czech photographer who voyaged across Europe and Africa and captured people and life at the turn of the century. Why is Beneš mysterious? His photo negatives have only recently been discovered and archived by another Czech photographer, Martin Wágner, but there is little information about Beneš himself.
It was in this caffee I saw a girl with Jack Russell and I had a thought that it was the very dog breed I needed. The Asian girl was sitting on a stool at a bar, slowly retracting dog biscuits from a pocket of her black jacket and feeding it to a dog who was watching her with lively and attentive eyes. The universe works in unique ways, and a day later we got Josef from a shelter, who is a mix of a Jack and a daschund, our misbehaving and beloved pup.
The café has solid desserts and very affordable house wines, so you can safely hide away in a corner with a book or with your work on a laptop.
Neustadt
Minus: they don’t serve coffee after 7 p.m. except for filtered coffee.
Plus: enchanting courtyard. If you are lucky enough you might even hear some music — there is a piano open for public to play. When the sounds fill up the courtyard, it is the most enchanting experience. The music will play its charm upon you.
Neustadt is a hipster place and rightly so. Just sit down and listen to how the voices of people around you echo from the walls of the courtyard. Look at the grapes on the adjacent wall and the little tower which will make you think a Rapunzel might actually feel quite comfortable here.
Literární kavárna Retêzova
If you find yourself in that very hellish part of town which is swarmed with tourists, you’ll crave to end up in a quiet place. Well, I’ve got you covered. Retezova street is in the very center but miraculously manages to stay crowd-free. The first time we came to Literarní kavarna was on our first visit to Prague. It was winter and in the middle of the day the place was empty. And so was it on all of my other visits. This is the perfect place to blog away, being inspired by all the black-and-white photographs of writers who used to frequent this place.
Mind you, despite the lack of people the service can be a bit slow — on the other hand, why hurry when you have all day to write that article?
Grand Café Orient
The very building in which Grand Cafe Orient is situated brings you back to an era of Czech cubism — all things pre-war, avant-garde, revolutionary and rebellious. I have never seen anything quite like it in design, and it is easy to see why Czech cubism is something the nation takes pride in — crystalline shapes and unexpected angles of ordinary objects. Its idea was to reject the secessionist architecture and yet if you look closely its aesthetic is as decorative as the style it rejected.
Paradoxically, Grand Cafe Orient on the second floor is less cubist, more art nouveau. The coffee is alright, this is definitely a place for people-watching, tourist-watching, to be precise. Yet the atmosphere lashes your imagination and it runs away like a wild steed into an era where rebelling with art was possible without the phones, but with the work full of expression.
Louvre
I didn’t want to include Louvre first because it defies my theory. At midday, it is definitely not a good place for introverts, because it’s packed with tourists. And even if you do get a place a stranger will most certainly come up and wish to sit with you. And if they sit down, they’ll most certainly engage into conversation with you. It happened to me on my last visit. An American lady, desperate for a lunch spot, sat down on the bench across from me, and as she was doing that already, I offered her to join me for lunch not to seem rude. We had a small talk about this and that — she was living in LA, came to Prague for a screenwriting and poetry workshop — don’t get me wrong, I love meeting artistic people, but it was not what I came to the cafe for. I came to dive into my own inner world, remember?
And yet I could not make a list of my favourite cafes and not include this one. There’s something absolutely tantalising in dining at the same table as Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Karel Čapek and Albert Einstein could have dined. They could have been writing letters, having philosophical readings or using these tables as a temporary office. That link to a different epoch amazes me and makes me fantasise: how different did life feel at that time? Did it feel less hectic? Cruel? Paced? More authentic? More like you owned it because there wasn’t any technology involved? Because you weren’t bombarded by all these little notifications and e-mails and messages that keep your mind in all other possible places but not actually in your life?
As you can see, it is a good place for meditation. As a bonus, this place has the only proper Turkish coffee in Prague, made and served in a proper little copper cezve. Mmm!
Cukrkavalimonada
Simply the best place in Mala Strana (the area of Prague on the other side of Charles Bridge). Especially good for salads, pasta and mouth-watering desserts. Because the tables are so close to each other, also very good for eavesdropping. Once I overheard a conversation between a woman — she was a teacher of Czech — and her date, apparently a “project manager”. I initially thought he was a spy, because he was carefully avoiding all talk about his work, giving vague answers like — “I am from US and work on some projects that have to do with Europe”. But in the end I thought may be he was just an asshole, trying to sound more important than he really was.
Anyway, if you love fresh food with an Italian twist — this place calls upon you. Be sure to bring a decent amount of cash though, as they don’t accept credit cards!
Do you enjoy visiting cafes by yourself? What does your favourite cafe look and feel like? I’d be very curious to know. And if you recommend another atmospherical cafe in Prague, i’ll be more than happy to check it out and include it in my list! Happy cafe-strolling!

The art museums in Prague hold some great works of art that you need to see during your trip. Why listen to my recommendations? I am an artist and I’ve been living in the Czech Republic for 10 months now. In this article, I am sharing with you the must-see art museums in Prague.
Read next: 6 Art Museums in Florence: The masterpieces you need to
I am starting with the Lubkowicz Palace because it holds a collection of artifacts that tell the most about Czech history.
The Palace entry ticket comes with an audio-guide that helps you explore Bohemian and European history through the Lobkowicz family and their collections — one of Europe’s oldest and finest private art collections, comprised of items dating back over 2,000 years. The collection highlights include paintings by Bruegel the Elder, Canaletto, and Velázquez and hand-annotated manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven.
P.S: The audio guide is narrated in English by two generations of the Lobkowicz family and the collections’ curators (also available in 10 other languages). The additional Prague InSpires Panorama audiotour introduces visitors to the city’s most iconic landmarks in under 30 minutes from the Lobkowicz Palace balcony.
My favorite museum in Prague is the national gallery (not to be confused with the national museum). With origins dating back to the 18th century, it is one of the oldest, largest, and most respected art museums in Central Europe. What makes this gallery unique is that its collections are spread out in various Baroque palaces, Medieval convents, and castles all around Prague. So, it is not one building but many different building. You can check out the official website for more details on the different buildings, opening hours, and ticket prices.
The National Gallery is particularly well-known for its wide collection of modern artists such as Picasso, Rousseau, Monet, and Cézanne. the National Gallery has an extensive collection of works by great Czech artists.
One of the most recognizable works in the National Gallery’s collection is Vincent van Gogh’s Green Field (1889). This is one of many landscape paintings Van Gogh produced while recovering at a mental asylum in Provence and it shows the painter at the height of his creative powers.
A not-so-popular museum, but if you are an art enthusiast, you definitely know the iconic master of Art Nouveau Alphonse Mucha. However, you may not know that he was actually Czech because he mostly lived in Paris during the Art Nouveau period. Mucha produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, and designs, which became among the best-known images of the period. For that, I think the museum deserves a visit.
At the age of 57, Mucha returned to his homeland and devoted himself to a series of twenty monumental symbolist canvases known as The Slav Epic, depicting the history of the Slavic people. On the 10th anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered The Slav Epic his most important work.
Not really an art museum but the Clementinum is Prague’s second-largest building complex after Prague Castle and houses the most beautiful library in the world. Among the 27,000 old printed works, there are, for example, Kepler’s writings with his handwritten dedication to his friends, the dean, and other professors at the Prague university. The Jesuits founded the Clementinum in 1556 and named it after the former Dominican monastery of St. Clement from 1227, where they settled. In 1775, meteorological data began to be collected here regularly; thus Prague has the longest continuous series of meteorological observations in Europe.
Prague is a gorgeous city that holds a significant number of museums and historical attractions. If I were to pick only one art museum to see in Prague, I’d visit The National Gallery, as it is the richest, widest and most interesting art collection in Prague. However, make sure to, once in yo

Prague: a holiday from the Covid insanity of the West,https://roberthutchinson.medium.com/prague-a-holiday-from-the-covid-insanity-of-the-west-6c4def7c5fe7?source=read_next_recirc---------2---------------------63b8b7a0_910e_4f51_9d26_2013463450f0----------,"Sign up

It’s a cold, sunny day in mid-January, and I’m sitting on a frosty barstool outside, sipping the hot mulled wine the Czechs call Svařák.
I can see the colorful Astronomical Clock about thirty feet away, built by Master Mikuláš Kadaň in the early 1400s, with the Church of Our Lady of Týn looming above Old Town Square.
Across the narrow cobblestone street stands the ornate house, dubbed the Minute House, where the influential writer Franz Kafka spent his early childhood.
As always, there is a constant flow of people bustling about, wrapped in parkas and earmuffs, moving into and out of the beautiful square. Many people stop every hour to watch the Twelve Apostles appear at the top of the Astronomical Clock.
It’s busy but not too crowded, yet more proof that the best time to travel is in the winter, when prices are low, tourists scarce and you can appreciate what a place has to offer.
I’ve come to Prague to escape the Covid madness still gripping much of the United States and the West — and the increasingly aggressive propaganda of the corporate media.
My grandchildren needed someone to take them back to London after their annual Christmas visit, and I instantly volunteered.
With my American Express travel points, I could get a ticket almost for free — and prices for a week-long visit in Prague were too good to pass up. My hotel right on the Old Town Square, with its large ornate bedrooms and funky statues of angels with swords, cost me just $83 per night, breakfast included. I couldn’t afford to stay home.
I did have to take not one but five separate Covid tests and demonstrate a near-professional knowledge of computers to clear the bureaucratic hurdles, but I sailed through Czech Immigration with hardly a glance.
After breakfast, I work in the mornings on my laptop and then spend the afternoons exploring the city — Prague Castle and the magnificent St. Vitus Cathedral on the hill, the medieval Charles Street bridge, the Museum of Communism, the shape-shifting steel statue of Kafka’s head by the artist David Černý, the National Museum near Wenceslas Square, the Jewish Quarter.
I pay the obligatory visit to an Absentherie, tasting the once-forbidden Green Fairy, and take a cruise out on the Moldau River.
What strikes me the most is the upbeat, freer atmosphere in Prague.
As much as the US prides itself on its love of liberty, the truth is that there is more freedom now in Eastern Europe than in many countries in the West or in places like Australia.
Some tourists wear face masks but most of the Czechs do not. Life has returned to normal here in Central Europe, and the smiling faces and friendly greetings of dobrý den on the street stand in marked contrast to what you see in locked-down Los Angeles, New York or Chicago.
After nearly a week, I have been asked only once for my digital Covid Passport, and, when the scanner couldn’t read the QR Code from the U.S., the waitress just shrugged her shoulders and let me in anyway.
The thing about the Czech Republic is that its people had more than 40 years’ experience dealing with Communist governments and their insane bureaucratic demands, from 1948 up until the Velvet Revolution threw the dictators out of power in 1989. Once you’ve dealt with Soviet tanks rolling down your streets, as happened in Prague in 1968, Covid insanity is small beer.
The other aspect to Prague that both delights and unsettles me is how safe and clean the city is. The streets are spotless, the centuries-old architecture magnificent and the buildings freshly painted.
There are no homeless visible on the streets at all, although you do occasionally see a beggar kneeling with his forehead touching the ground, hat or cup obsequiously raised upward for a donation. Young women walk the dark alleyways and cobblestone streets late at night, seemingly unafraid.
In contrast, on the car trip to Los Angeles for my flight here, there were entire tent cities tucked underneath the freeway overpasses, mounds of garbage piled ten feet high. Violent crime in American cities is skyrocketing, thanks to the “defund the police” movement and the election of “decriminalize everything” leftist prosecutors.
In other words: Prague shows you that cities don’t have to be cesspools of crime, violence and uncollected garbage. Instead, they can be havens of culture, beauty and neighborliness. The ethnic hatreds and identity politics that are tearing America and countries like the UK apart are absent here.
In the end, this trip is restoring my faith in humanity — and in the possibility, at least, that big cities can be livable again.
If the relatively poor Czech Republic can afford cities of unparalleled beauty and serenity, surely the vastly more affluent United States can do the same.
The lesson I take from Prague, therefore, is that there is hope for the future.
If the Czech people were able to remove authoritarian, surveillance-obsessed bureaucrats from power in a peaceful, nonviolent revolution, so, too, can liberty-loving Americans. Hopefully, it won’t take us 40 years.

Just two girls on a city break with a fascination with pretty buildings.
The Old Town in Prague, Zone 1, is bustling with amazing architecture, Czech landmarks and an abundance of food stalls, restaurants and shops. Before departing on our break, my friend and I had a list of attractions we were keen to see which included the well-known Astronomical clock, the infinite book tower in the Municipal Library and the rotating Kafka head. However, we found that simply walking down the street was entertainment enough. Both of us were in awe of the city’s creative architecture, clean streets and colourful buildings. This combined with the cobbled paths, countless clocks and mini archways connecting buildings together had me convinced that I should be moving to Prague some time in my future. The use of space here was so appealing and interesting, with charming restaurants providing seating under mini bridges — I was overcome with endless things to look at and appreciate. In the two and a half days and 60,000 steps we were there for, we Czech-ed everything off our list and left eager to return.
Day one was a travel day, and, after an early start and some unexpected extra leg room seats, we arrived at our hotel located twenty minutes’ walk outside of the Old Town. With no real idea of where we were going, and no knowledge of direction between us, we set off in the general direction of the ‘city centre.’ As it turned out, we were soon met with a high street of stores, food places and souvenir shops. Even the architecture of familiar shops we regularly frequent at home, such as H&M and Zara, had us amazed with their intricate brick work and elegant lighting. We came across a market with stalls selling fresh fruit and souvenirs before accidentally, but fortunately, arriving in the Old Town Square — location of the Astronomical clock. The square was beautiful with outdoor seating, stringed fairy lights and once again, the cool Czech architecture. After, of course, taking some pictures we joined a crowd of people gathered around the oldest clock still in operation and wondered what we were waiting for. As the five o’clock hour hit, we all watched in silence as the clock chimed with a little “cuckoo” at the end. Also, we found the Sex museum which gave us lots of laughs as there is a chair in the entrance way with a ‘Love Tester’ scale rating you from frozen to sex bomb. My friend and I were disappointed to find out that we were ‘tepid’ and ‘frozen’ and left once I’d had another go to determine that I am in fact ‘boiling’ and the first try was just a practise. Afterwards, we headed in the direction of shops we knew we couldn’t afford for some window shopping and more picture taking. We stared gormlessly at handbags and amazing coats in the likes of Dior, Prada and Louis Vuitton before admitting defeat and going in search of food. For our first night, we decided to tick off Prague’s hard rock café and enjoyed some great food there before heading homewards for an early night.
Prague day two began with a slow start, still sleepy from the early rise the day prior. However, arriving at the breakfast buffet, coupled with some strong coffee, eased away our tiredness and we vaguely planned out our day. Our plan was to firm the queue outside the Municipal library in order to see the infinite book tower but once again, our poor sense of direction lead us to a different landmark on our list. We stopped and took in the rotating Kafka head before agreeing it was time to pull out apple maps and stick to our plan. After queueing for about 30–40 minutes on a hot, sunny day in Czech we approached the tower of books. The illusion this tower creates through the use of mirrors is incredible — when you look down it feels like if you stepped through you would fall forever. This was a hotspot for tourists from all over the world and many pictures were taken here. The tower contains around 8,000 books and I would highly recommend this attraction. The heat and the walking had us hungry, so we headed around the corner to a little café called ‘Coffee and Waffles’ recommended to us on TikTok and as described, we ordered a coffee and waffle each. They had some very interesting waffle and coffee choices — I had a caprese waffle and my friend had a Crème Brulé coffee, which I was jealous I didn’t get myself. The atmosphere inside was calming and lovely and I enjoyed my first savoury waffle — even if it did take a minute to get used to the variety of textures. Our afternoon consisted of shopping… we couldn’t help ourselves! We each bought clothes to wear to dinner that night and headed to the hotel in the evening to change for dinner. As our day had been so jam packed and busy, we had lost track of timing and the restaurant we had planned to visit for dinner was fully booked (this place was called Pasta Fresca and was also fully booked the next evening too so I would recommend booking well in advance as it must be popular). However, we found another lovely Italian place not far from it and enjoyed dinner outside whilst people watching and discussing our day. Once we’d settled the bill, we headed back to the centre to grab a chimney cake. These are absolutely amazing — a chimney shaped dough with fillings such as ice cream or chocolate and strawberries. This was definitely a tourist staple! After forcing our stomachs to accept more food, we went to bed, sad to be heading into our last day in Prague.
Another hot and sunny day commenced, and we set off walking around more cool buildings and churches that we had missed the last two days. Today was the day for some souvenir shopping and presents for family and friends. There were so many options for these kinds of gifts and, after purchasing some postcards, we moved onto a place we had clocked on our first day. This shop is called Candy Miners and is a pick n mix shop where all the sweets are stored in old miners’ carriages and scales. The experience was really cool, and the sweets contained some unique and interesting shapes and flavours. We spent some time in there selecting an assortment of sweets for our partners. We also headed to the chocolate museum and shop which, again, had some very curious flavours to try — and a lot of phallic shaped chocolate (not very appropriate for the parents!). All of this shopping had us thirsty, so we found a nice juice bar — come — café and sat down outside for a relax. For dinner on our last night, we found another highly recommended place from TikTok (where we apparently get all of our travel advice) and walked over to Prague 2. The place is called Hoxton burgers, and it was ten out of ten. We each got a beef smashed burger, passion fruit lemonade and shared a loaded bacon cheesy fries. The atmosphere and lighting were very unique and edgy and, once again, we were full to bursting. Finally, we made our way across the road to the church of St Ludmila, which was extremely pretty, and took our last pictures in Prague before returning to the hotel to pack and prepare for our early morning flight.
All in all, Prague was a fantastic city break and my friend and I are both keen to return. I think that next time I go, I would like to try more traditional Czech food and visit some of the other zones as the majority of our time was spent in Prague zone 1 and 2. In terms of the city itself, the area was extremely clean and well presented and Czech residents were exceptionally lovely and considerate.
I hope you enjoyed reading! :)

GETTING MY HAIRCUT while traveling is something that I still can’t take in my stride. Because of this I now look like one of those Barber: What you want? memes. Here’s my easy step-by-step guide on how not to get a haircut in a foreign country. Haircuts, as they say, are 20:20.
There are two key factors you should aim for when truly trying to devastate your hairdo: laziness and language barriers. Thankfully, I achieved both.Laziness, over time, will allow your hair to look odd. It grows this way and that- always unevenly, of course. Eventually, it will evolve to a look bad enough that if you bump into someone you hadn’t seen in a while they feel obliged to ask “Everything okay man?”
By this stage you start to think ‘You know what? A bad haircut probably wouldn’t be worse than this.’(*Note* If you reach this point, remind yourself: a bad haircut is, in fact, much worse).
This morning, I had that incorrect thought. It was time to get a haircut in Prague.
‘The difference between a good haircut and a bad one is a couple of weeks’ my Granny says. As an Irishman, I would never be seen to disagree with my grandmother. But, come to think about it: A travel blog is the safest place to dispute your 93-year old Granny’s opinion and get away with it.
That’s if I was to do it. Which I would not.
As mentioned, my hair was more than unruly. It was bordering on passers-by questioning my mental health. Too short to be long hair; too long to be considered short. I looked tragic.
I had 2 work meetings on Google Hangouts later that day. Not the phone ones in your PJs. Video ones where you need to appear compos mentis.It seemed as good a day as any to smarten up.
I researched some Prague barbers and found plenty. There was an American Expat website that offered some decent options. Weighing them all up, I decided it would be best to procrastinate.
I took a break from helpful research and watched YouTube videos on ‘How To Cut Your Own Hair’ instead. Almost all of them were imitating a David Beckham haircut of one time or other.
Could I do this myself? I had my own lightweight electric razor…
Could I ask my wife, perhaps? Remembering our hostile afternoon in Cape Cod after how I reacted to her previous attempt, I thought better of it. Back to Google.
It ultimately came down to discovering the barbers closest to Prague’s Old Town Square, where I am staying. I reviewed the reviews and set my sights on their sites. One, in particular, seemed slick.
The website and Facebook page gave a good first impression. It spoke to my need to think that I’m cool and stylish at 31. Even the translation for tutto barbuto- ‘fully bearded’- was pretty badass.
Customers drank scotches and smoked shisha in the online pictures. Smoking Hookah isn’t my thing. But drinking scotch while getting a haircut would be great to tick off the bucket list. It was 10am.
My wife Rachael and I embarked on the 6-min journey by foot from the Old Town Square to Tutto Barbuto.
By Prague standards, it was mild although my toes were beginning to lose sensation.
Flecks of snow fell lazily on the streets, too few and far between to ever last.When we found Tutto Barbutto, it was dark and empty. For a moment, I thought it was closed.
Before turning to leave, I hurled a tentative ‘Dobrý den?’ towards the back of the shop. A small woman, maybe 26, emerged immediately, greeting me in Czech.
-I’m sorry, but do you speak English?-No.
We were off to the perfect start.
We were at an impasse. She had been clear she didn’t speak English. I had zero Czech but 2 impending Google Hangouts. Not to mention, the 99 problems growing out of my head. I decided to push through in English.
-Are you open?
-Yes.
That was good enough for me. I removed my coat and scarf then sat into the barber’s chair.
The lady who was about to cut my hair had dark features and a Marilyn Monroe portrait on her inner arm. I produced my phone to show her the picture I had screen-shotted as inspiration for whoever cut my hair.
This screenshot technique always strikes me as awkward. You can’t show them a photo of somebody who is tooooo attractive or it feels as if your drawing comparisons between yourself and the male model staring back at them dreamily from your phone.
Even the act of providing a photo is something I steer clear from when home in Ireland. Doing anything outside what is seen as standard behavior could be met with the most withering critique an Irish person can give a compatriot:
“He’s getting notions about himself”.
Looking at the screenshot, she zoomed in.
“Very fastidious,” I thought.
She could have been thinking “This man has notions,” in Czech.
To reaffirm we were on the same page, I pointed to the side of my head- albeit, an overgrown one- and said “Very short”. Then I helpfully pointed to the top of my head and said “Long”.
I find myself in these lost in translation moments regularly. While in the midst of them, I hope that a sizable smile will fill the gaps and encourage my opposite number to give me the benefit of the doubt while I point at my head and say random words.
-Zero blade?-No, thanks. A one.
I’m sure I held up one finger and accompanied it with another oversmile.
After a quick wash, the razor purred and hairs began to drop. So long, old friends.
She was painstaking and focused, spending what seemed like 15 minutes on the sides alone. It looked terrific. Suddenly the phone rang and she went to retrieve it.
Rachael came over to the chair for a moment and we both talked about how good I looked before the hairdresser returned.
I’m a long term insomniac and the night before had been rough. I had laid awake from 3.30am-7 before giving up the ghost of sleep and getting up to work out. It was only 10.30 in the morning, but I’d already been awake 7 hours. My eyes were heavy.
And now that the adrenaline was wearing off since my hairdresser was so good, I wasn’t sure I would be able to stay awake in the warm barbershop.Snip.
She chopped about three inches from my hair in one fell swoop. She had clearly experienced my universal gesture of point-at-top-of-head-and-say-long though. Or had she? I waited to see.
Snip.
Snip-snip. Snipsnipsnip.
I looked in stunned silence waiting for her to stop. She didn’t.
While I knew I needed a serious cut, I had expected to leave with much more hair to brave the bitter Prague weather. That protective layer of hair now lay on the floor beneath me.
As I write this now, it seems so stupid. Why not just stop her? There was something that was making me give her the benefit of the doubt, though. I felt like she had a plan.
Turns out she really didn’t.
Rach had been on her phone for the last few hellacious minutes. In the mirror, I saw her look up.
“Keith!”
I ignored her call, trying to look calm as if this was all my plan. The man with the plan.
“KEITH” she called again, louder.
I looked at her in eyebrow-raised resignation. Edwina Scissorhands chopped on, oblivious
Rach jumped out of her seat and walked towards the blizzard of hair.
“You’ve cut it too short!”
The hairdresser paused. After a moment she said:
“Was damaged.”
“It’s fine,” I said to no one in particular in consummate Irishness.
And it was fine. Just about as fine as looking like an idiot can be. The strangest think about my Prague haircut was that, at the end, she shaved back my hairline a half-inch or so.
Image of google screenshot for Prague hairdresser and how it turned out.Can you spot the difference between my Prague haircut and the model?When she finished, it didn’t look so bad. I won’t claim I looked good but it could have been worse. Through a combo or blow-drying and hair-spraying, she made it seem like she hadn’t scalped me.
Stepping away from the scene of the massacre, that big broad smile from earlier was a little more difficult to muster. But muster it I did; long enough to pay the 569 Czech Koruna (about $23).
Then I did what any self-respected Irish person would do.I thanked her and left a tip.

Prague
I had not heard a single negative thing about Prague before arriving — most of the travelers I had encountered prior had preached about how amazing of a city it is. This had my expectations sky-high for the Czech city, which I hereby declare the Interstellar Mistake (Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Hans Zimmer, reality-based space sci-fi… how could it have not been the best film of all time?!) When I only get to visit a place for a few days, my entire perception of it is largely dependent on the weather while I’m there (Ireland is beautifully sunny and warm, in case you were unaware). Unfortunately for me, my visit to Prague was accompanied by clouds, rain, and cold weather.
That said, it still is architecturally a magnificent place, thanks partially to it not being blown up by war. After all the historically significant, gigantic, celebrated churches I’ve seen over the past three months, the Gothic churches of Prague are far and away my favorite. The charred-looking stone and ridiculously intricate gold and black ornamentation stand out prominently above the other buildings of the city. The largest of these, St. Vitus Cathedral, sits in the middle of the Prague castle on the top of a hill overlooking the Vltava river. The castle itself is a pretty well protected peek into the past, with the palace, churches, shops, and residencies that once inhabited the space within the castle walls.
Another thing Prague does do well is public / street art. This is also most definitely in response to Soviet rule of the city. One particular space called the “Lennon Wall” celebrates the freedom to write anything on a public wall without an authority covering it up. Every day, hundreds of people come by and paint their own drawings and words on the wall, which is now feet thicker due to so many coats of paint. Beyond this street art, there are many humorous statues with implied political meaning, such as giant bronze babies with barcodes instead of faces, and two men urinating in a pool shaped as the Czech Republic. I don’t exactly remember the point of that one, but it’s funny nonetheless. Hopefully one day I’ll be able to return to Prague under clearer weather and lower expectations, and be able to thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the place.

Prague is beautiful and it never lets you go. If you are lucky enough to visit it, then likely you will end up doing the same things the majority of the tourists do: sightsee Prague Castle, shop at the Old Town square, take a picture near the John Lennon wall and cross Charles Bridge.
There is nothing wrong with checking all the “touristy attractions”, but there is just so much more to Prague, and I would not like you to miss that. When you take a few steps away from Prague’s most famous spots— a world brimming with lively culture opens up.
I was born in Prague and even if I lived in other cities, Prague will be always my hometown. It is a beautiful and unique city with many things to do and see. I will show you some secret, local-approved things you must do when in Prague. Here they are.
I strongly recommend checking the lesser-known 10th-century castle of Vysehrad. It offers some great views of the river and the city but also features lovely grounds perfect for picnics and gatherings with friends. Some of…

When you visit Prague, the list of landmarks to see is quite obvious — The Prague Castle, Old Town, Charles Bridge with its famous statues. But between them you may find some strange… things, let’s say. In such a case, it’s very possible you’ve just come across the work of Czech artist, David Černý. And as strange as they are, all of them are worth seeing.
Here’s the shortlist of his work list — for more, visit davidcerny.cz
One of the most characteristic sculptures of Černý is St. Wenceslas riding a dead horse, hanging in the passage of Lucerna Palace.
If you have already walked on the nearby Wenceslas Square, you might think this looks somehow familiar. Indeed, this sculpture was inspired by the famous Statue of Saint Wenceslas. It’s even the same in size. But the horse is dead, and upside down. Don’t ask. Allegedly, it represents the idea of thinking that everything is fine, even if it’s not.
Nevertheless, move to the nearby Quadrio Shopping Centre — to its back entrance, to be precise. You won’t miss the enormous, steel sculpture of Franz Kafka, the famous Austrian-Czech writer. His head, to be precise.
It’s 10 meters tall and made of 42 rotating stainless steel panels. It doesn’t really belong to the Old Town, which is probably the best reason for placing it right there (it stands on the private ground). The Czech sense of humor.
Speaking of heads, one of the most recent works is the monument of Trifot, 12-meter tall sculpture inspired by Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham. To reach it, you should take Metro Line B and get out at Nove Butovice station.
The eyes of the Trifot are actually camera lenses, which are able to take the photos of passers-by. And those photos can be shown on the nearby screens (unfortunately, this was out of order in 2023, when I visited Prague — don’t know if it works now). Quite a nod to the omnipresent user tracking.
But Černý’s work is not limited to sculptures only. You can see the part of him in everyday objects. Like the counter top in Mlynska Cafe (Kavárna Mlýnská) in Kampa Park.
Partly a pub, partly a cafe, Mlynska serves as a cozy place for a drink, located in an old mill. If you sit at the bar, you’ll notice a unique counter top created by Černý. It’s actually a mix of rubbish found in Vltava, and random stuff left by the visitors — all immersed in an artificial resin. In a certain sense, it’s a picture of local life, stuck forever like archaeological treasures on a museum exhibition.
Speaking of museums, if you want to explore the world of David Černý’s mind, you should visit Musoleum, where you’ll find many of his other works, including Entropa, his variation on European Union countries.
Oddly enough, even though the work was unveiled in 2009, United Kingdom is not represented (in other words, represented as a missing piece) in the sculpture. It was then a symbol of British isolation from Europe, and only predicted Brexit 7 yeards later.

The Czech capital guards its secrets.
We came late to Prague. By the time we made our way to the red-roofed city, the path to the east was already well-beaten by hordes of budget travelers and lairy British stag parties. An influx of foreign tourists has pushed Prague close to the top of the list of Europe’s most visited cities, with all the opportunities and problems that kind of popularity creates for the local residents.
But Prague is every bit as beautiful as it was back when it seemed so exotic, smiling shyly behind the Iron Curtain. The Haussmannian grandeur of the Old Town buildings invites comparison with Paris, but Parisiens would never allow their buildings to be painted like this. Bright yellow next to powder blue beside terracotta. And while tourists gape at the astronomical clock that jerks into life twenty-four times a day, the sun — when it shines — gilds the dark spires of the Church of Our Lady of Tyn and makes the old stones glow as brightly as the painted buildings.
The same force that makes a person wander the world pushes flowers from the ground to salute the distant sun. The artists of Prague don’t stop painting the old buildings just because they can no longer afford to own them. Among the graffiti of the Old Town, two themes recurred: the Golem, as played by Paul Wegener in the 1920 horror film he directed. And the simple phrase, in English: Life Is Beautiful.
Flowers bloom and die and never leave a mark, and for most of us, this beautiful life is the same.
Few of us shape history, like the dead kings in their cold tombs on the high hill where Prague’s castle stands. But that doesn’t keep us from trying. For an additional fee that’s as steep as the stairs, you can climb the tower of St Vitus Cathedral and look out across the river at Prague. And up there, in the teeth of the wind that rises from the Vltava, you can see the old stones scored with the initials of decades of visitors, the merged letters in a dozen languages forming the ridges and valleys of an insensate fingerprint.
Prague isn’t as cheap as it used to be when the first intrepid tourists arrived from the West after the fall of Communism. But it’s still an absolute steal compared to the likes of Paris or London or Barcelona. Two nights at the gorgeous five star Art Nouveau Palace cost 166 euros after tax. Dinner and drinks for two at a Michelin starred restaurant for 200. Prague still represents a great deal for a budget traveler and offers a chance to splash out on high-end experiences at a price you could never hope to pay in other European capitals.
Prague has other marks, too. Scars with gloomier origins than the vandalizing initials of bright and brutish tourists.
On the day we visited, a young woman was lighting a candle in front of the narrow window of the church basement. The stone is still pockmarked with holes, where Nazi bullets once struck sparks from the walls. Seven hundred and fifty soldiers launched attack after attack on the church, but couldn’t dislodge the men hiding inside.
After hours of fighting, the Germans brought in the fire brigade and ordered them to flood the basement. Not one of the Czech freedom fighters was taken alive. The mission cost them their lives and the lives of anyone connected to them. It also prompted Nazi massacres in villages entirely unconnected with the plot. But it was the only successful assassination of a high-ranking Nazi officer. The war would continue, of course, with or without Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler’s ‘man with an iron heart.’ But at the cost of their lives, Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis, Adolf Opalka, Josef Bublik, Jaroslav Svarc, Josef Valcik, and Jan Hruby proved that despite their military prowess, even the highest-ranking officials of the Nazi government could be killed. And 70 years later, Czechs still honor the bravery of men willing to die for their country.
Some fights are worth having. And life is beautiful. So beautiful that sometimes it’s worth losing.
Prague feels like the kind of place with secrets. It’s still relatively new to modern mass tourism, having been shut off behind the Iron Curtain within my lifetime. You can see it in the bullet marks, or in the creepy statue of the Commendatore outside the theater where Mozart’s Don Giovanni premiered. You can see it in the frowning face of the ubiquitous Golem.
Stories make cities what they are, just as they do for people. We become the sum of what we experience, our cathedrals and our bullet holes. Our spires and basements. We may be the wealthiest and most fortunate group of people in human history, and yet so many of us are afraid. Afraid to lose what we have. Afraid to fail. Afraid of others who are themselves prisoners of fear, that makes them lash out and bite anyone they can reach. Fear lives at the heart of our culture, the magic word written down and stuffed into the hollow clay skull of the Golem to make it live.
Tyranny comes in many forms, and fear has always been one of its favorite weapons. Prisons without bars are the hardest to escape. I’m living proof that you can spend your whole life making what seems like the right decision and never get any closer to what you really want — the raw experience of being alive. Inside each of us, an iron-hearted voice commands caution, and while we hoard worthless tokens and live in fear of losing, we miss the bright imperfect world sailing by.
And yet we all want to make our mark. That brief blaze of light across an immensity of darkness, to say in some way to the uncaring universe that we were here. This is mine, a few words held out into the world like writing on water, vanishing even in the act of creation. The rough wind whirls the ticket from my hand, and I carry on without it, lighter for the loss.

Presented at ICOM Prague. August 24, 2022. Because I don’t ever fully ‘write’ talks but instead assemble slides which I then talk ‘around’, what follows is a very slightly more verbose version. The images used in the presentation, of which some are included here, were generated using the ‘of the moment’ AI image synthesis tools Midjourney and DALL-E2, I have included the relevant prompts used in the image captions. I wanted to use those images as a means of hinting at some of what I didn’t talk about.
Hello. I changed jobs last week and so did my slides.
I’d like to acknowledge that these words were prepared on the unceded lands of the people of the Kulin Nation in Naarm (Melbourne). The ideas I will talk about are the result of working with many collaborators, and inspired by many other poeple. All knowledge is the result of generosity and intercultural exchange.
A huge thank you to ICOM, and the organising team in Prague especially Martina and Jiri. And also to the tech team here at the conference centre who were able to deal with my request to present on my own device from the stage. I know how hard this can be when you’ve not set up your venue to make that possible.
I work at ACMI, Australia’s national museum of screen culture. I will give you a little bit of background because it will help contextualise some of what I say later. Because this is ICOM, let’s begin with our collection.
ACMI has a large collection of different types of objects and media. Our historical time-based media is stored on analogue and magnetic formats but our contemporary commissions arrive as digital files on digital storage formats — hard drives, USB sticks. This used to be rare. It is now common. The range and diversity of our contemporary works continues to expand from linear to interactive, networked, and multiplayer games.
As you may also be aware, Melbourne also has an amazing videogame-making creative community. As a result we also collect modern videogames and because of the uncertainty and complexity in digital preservation, this is a collaborative effort with Powerhouse Museum (Sydney) and National Film and Sound Archive (Canberra). This approach to collecting contemporary software-based artworks is greatly assisted by this distributed collecting approach, which I believe will become necessary and standard practice across many types of museum.
Through this process we’ve learned that digital objects are more fragile than their analogue ‘originals’, and that both digital and digitised objects exist in systems that require reliable power, engineering, maintenance, ongoing software development. These are all challenging frontiers for museums.
Further, collecting modern materials and presenting them for contemporary audiences has forced us to rethink the documentation processes of the past. Our online collection documentation reveals to the public the bias in what has (and has not) been collected, and how the language used in historical documentation practices reflects the prejudices and social biases of its time.
We also make rich experiential exhibitions that take advantage of constantly improving projection and interactive technologies. ACMI is also a bit famous for The Lens. With the support of the Lens, ACMI wants to change the media we make and consume. We want to change the what, the how, and the why of cinema, of television, of games. The Lens is one in a range of technologies to foreground the visitors’ agency in this. And the visitors’ responsibility to ‘take the museum home with them’. We work with the seductiveness of the media forms to sow the seeds of a critical eye, ear and hand.
Things have changed.
The old ACMI used to be a place to come to see an exhibition or watch arthouse cinema. That was how we measured success. The new ACMI suceeds when it changes what you watch or make, and changes how you watch and make. And that change could occur anywhere — hence our brand as a ‘multiplatform museum’. We are still figurng out how to best measure that.
ACMI’s mission and how we fulfil that mission has been transformed by harnessing the potential of new technologies.
As a quick aside, at ICOM, many people have asked me about ‘the metaverse’. Julian Oliver, now a well known contemporary artist (‘critical engineer’) along with Chad Chatterton, and Andrea Blundell — built a real-time collaborative virtual world — ACMIpark — that reproduced ACMI and Federation Square online, and bridged the physical and the virtual.
This was before Second Life, before Facebook.That was twenty years ago.
These ideas that seem new are not new.
The rest of the talk is a gentle provocation.
In 1968, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a conference on ‘computers and museums’. It was very important, and like many things from the late 1960s, we still feel its resonance today. At that conference the University of Illinois presented the PLATO system [Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Applications]. PLATO was originally developed for the Illiac I computer connected to 20 student terminals and was a key part of education technology research. In these images we glimpse the birth of user experience design for media technology in museums.
“The terminal must be simple to use, yet flexible enough to accommodate and display many types of information. It must provide enough depth and scope of information to challenge the visitor without confusing him. It must involve him in gathering information and answering questions without frustrating him.”
You can see on this user diagram the familiar ideas of story, question & answer, user comments, related objects that museum educators and designers still focus on today. These are some of the first terms we still see in design briefs for gallery interactive experiences, and online catalogues.
That was more than fifty years ago.
It was designed in an era before the arrival of colour television.
We still think like that today.
In 1994 I was at university. Both I and many others were excited by the arrival of the nascent public web. For those of us in Australia and NZ, the 1990s and early 2000s ignited a utopian dream of ‘planetary computation’ and access to a ‘global network’. Culturally too — for us, distant and far awy — it offered the mirage of an opportunity to destabilise the media power centres of Europe and North America.
The web could have gone in many directions. There was the cosmopolitan web, the web as an infinite library, the web as a playground. And of course the web as a shopping mall.
Museum websites were rare but the first that existed were courageous. Some museums collaborated with others to build ‘knowledge portals’ and in some countries, museums even provided internet access directly to communities that they worked with. Even though screen resolutions were tiny, museums were worried about the people ‘stealing our thumbnail images’.
It was a short lived dream.
Back then it felt like digital technology promised a lot. We thought expansively about the opportunities and that early history of museums and the web is largely one of exploration and imagination.
Unfortunately we didn’t question the underlying logic or politics of the databases we were working with or building. That would come much later.
Nowadays, every museum has a website. Even the smallest. And they ‘do social media’ even if its a job done by a volunteer. They don’t even need to do it well. Their web presence is just a communication of ‘we exist’ — like a sign on a motorway that cars zoom past barely noticing.
In 2008 the smartphone and mobile devices grew web access by billions of people. Suddenly half of the planet was connected — we did not think of the consequences of such rapid change. More people, all at once, was great for the profits of technology companies, but not for much else. The debates around access to the internet changed to focus on the quality of that access.
The internet is now awash with digital content and museums flood the web with their digitised collections. As a result of the economics of web platforms, everything is tracked. In an attention economy, breadth wins over depth. More, more and more.
We have seen that flood of content change our politics, grow misinformation, grow fear, destabilise our societies. In the absence of shared narratives, communities will create their own narratives — true, false, rumour or otherwise.
The companies that emerged as part of the Web 2.0 wave have merged and consolidated into a handful of closed, data leveraged platforms. Free-to-use platforms have monetised our attention, monetised our data.
It turns out that the Internet is not a place.
We need to stop thinking about it using metaphors of place. There is no ‘there’ there.
The cloud is simply a server farm in a region of cheap real estate with manageable weather and reliable energy supply. Like ACMI’s digital collections it is fragile. More fragile than we think. During the recent UK heatwave, several of the server farms underpinning the UK cloud came under extreme heat stress impacting the performance of major digital platforms. We should expect this to worsen — and more of the Global North will be exposed to the conditions that the Global South has existed as an everyday reality.
The internet is not a place. It is better thought of as a time machine, or a time sink.
So now what?
Through the pandemic I’ve been running a mentoring scheme for arts and culture CEOs pairing them with digital practitioners. In this program we work through conceptual and strategic issues around technology and how it affects and creates opportunities across different artforms and practices. It aims at building competencies amongst senior arts leaders to help them navigate the potential of the future — developing a both capabilites and critically, fostering a digital imagination.
It has not just been for museums but also for ‘adjacent’ arts institutions — theatre, music, dance, cultural centres, performance venues. Through it, we have realised that we share many of the same challenges — ageing infrastructure conceived of in the last decade of the 20th century; skills that are expensive and rare; and as a result of infrastructural and skills shortages, we have crimped our imaginations. We talk a lot about risk, and we talk about cybersecurity, machine learning, bias, we talk about accessibility and we talk about sharing services across domains.
At the heart of this is the question, what might institutions need to support the creative practices of the future — for the more diverse audiences of the future?
Our conversations have shifted from digital marketing, the latest immersive spectacle, and back of house operations to tangible transformation —21st century infrastructure, staff skills and an expanded creative imagination. And how that shift inevitably leads to new questions about institutional purpose.
How might our buildings adapt and be re-designed for an always-connected visitor? And even more importantly, how might we retain that visitor’s attention and focus whilst they are in our building?
How might we shift our focus from technologies of ‘information and data’, to those of world-building, narrative, emotion and imagination?
How might we better collaborate across the arts and cultural sector?
But, and there is always a but.
The pandemic and its social effects has created a huge demand for quick ‘solutions’. Around the globe many institutions are in desperate situations — lacking revenue, lacking State support, pressured by the demands of a rapidly changing social and cultural context.
This situation sets up a risky situation where museums and those in a desperate situtation are easy marks for questionable ‘solutions’. Just as museums are not neutral, neither are technologies. All technologies have a politics and all media technologies have a specific grain. Museums will be ineffective if we do not understand the nuance of that grain.
Networked digital technologies are not inherently democratic.
New web technologies are easily branded with the language and rhetoric of liberation. We have seen this recently in the rhetoric around so-called Web3. This language often hides extractive and anti-democratic intent.
Beware the term ‘decentralization’ in this context.
In the technology discourse around Web3, ‘decentralization’ can be a legitimate desire to unseat the powerful platforms that control much of the web as we experience it today.
But when coupled with ‘blockchain’ it is also easily co-opted into a series of ideologies that work against many of the ethics and purpose of our institutions. In this context ‘decentralization’ undermines the very idea of institutions and in some cases, sees societies only a mass of individuals distrustful of each other, mediated by so-called ‘smart contracts’. In this context, ‘decentralization’ can be code for unfettered libertiarian anarcho-capitalism.
Museums beware.
Beware, too, if you do not understand how the companies you work with expect to generate profit for their investors and shareholders. In modern technology industries, funded by venture capital, the way in which revenue is generated is often very opaque.
And remember the words of Kate Crawford and Vladen Joler in 2018, writing on the technologies behind the Amazon Echo, but applicable to contemporary digital services generally,
“each small moment of convenience — be it answering a question, turning on a light, or playing a song — requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data”
With that in mind, we need to be clear about what change we want our museums to make in our communities before we can appropriately choose the technologies that will help us realise this.
What does your museum actually want technology to do for it? Is it more than “greater efficiency”, more than “new revenue opportunities”, more than “reaching younger audiences”?
Looking back to that conference of 1968 and its prescient but unacheived ideas, how might your museum imagine possibilities that were actually unimaginable half a century ago?
Who do you partner with to achieve this ethically, sustainably, and in the least extractive manner possible?
You need to be able to confidently answer these questions in a manner that speaks to your institution’s mission and purpose because every museum technologist with any experience will tell you“… technology is expensive, difficult, needs a lot of maintenance, it will break, it will become obsolete, and your vendor will disappear”.
They are right.
Thank you to ICOM, the ICOM conference committee in Prague, Martina Lehmannová, Jiří Stýblo, and everyone who has been so welcoming on this trip.

August 28, 2012.
I had just finished my dietetic internship in NYC at the hospital formerly known as Beth Israel Medical Center, now transitioned to Mount Sinai, and I felt a sense of freedom. Where better to reap the benefits of this long-lost feeling than wander around Eastern Europe, specifically Bohemia, specifically Prague?
I hopped on an ICE fast train from Leipzig, Germany to Prague. Back then I had no smartphone, and I used a paper map to guide my way through the winding European streets. I got around just fine, except for that one time I was lost in the rain at 2 am. I did eventually find my way back to the Hotel Sunflower.
One thing I pack with me while traveling is a notebook and pen to write down thoughts, ideas, things I would like to do and see; places to eat and drink. My weekend in Bohemia included a typical tourist visit to Prague Castle and the Staropramen Brewery, yet it also included some not-for-tourist places such as Tynska Bar & Books, and this other place I had read about that was known for its vegetarian food in the land of pork knuckle and dumplings. The Czech name of the restaurant is Lehka Hlava, which translates to Clear Head.
Perfect, I thought. The name called to me after my long-lost night. I needed to clear my head.
After I arrived and was taken to my table at the restaurant I noticed a table of four women near my table of one. They were laughing, and enjoying their food and wine. Seeing them made me miss my friends back home. I bounced back into the present and ordered a full meal complete with a starter, a main, and a dessert with one glass of wine.
Looking back all these years later I cannot remember exactly what I ordered, but I do remember that the meal I had that evening in Prague was the best meal I had while traveling Bohemia. I remember the bill was equivalent to about 12 US dollars, which has been embedded into my memory since I was a graduate student at NYU at the time— not rich in money, but rich in books.
Although I cannot recall exactly what I chose on the menu nor did I take any photos of it, I do know that my solo dining experience was welcomed, and the food was honestly delicious.
Now many years later I glance at the menu on my computer. It includes items such as pumpkin and ginger soup with orange juice, vegetable consommé with yeast dumplings, spaghetti with tempeh bacon and sauce of baked garlic, gértaix — cheese balls with cumin sticks, wasabi dressing, and balsamic reduction, Kimchi-potato pancake — traditional Czech potato pancake with kimchi and spring onion, and hot raspberry crumble with mascarpone-ricotta cream.
The menu reflects the diversity of the chefs at Lehka Hlava, and each dish has a goal to both electrify and soothe the senses. I still think about this restaurant now and then. It pops into my mind as “those carefree days.” It was such a relaxing atmosphere and left me with a sense of, well, clarity. I left Prague happy and with lucidity. I did not get lost that night with my paper map.

“I don’t have a girlfriend, but I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that.”
-Mitch
I decided on Prague next because Kevin had told me you can get wasted there for 5 bucks. That was enough for me. Kevin always knows the right move. Except for the time he jumped into the Chicago River, drunk as hell, to rescue a shoe. That was dumb. The Czech Republic had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
The only issue with Prague was the overnight, 14-hour train ride I needed to take to get there. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to go. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost the equivalent of 4 Euros/night (about $6 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be 3 hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is some deceptive bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand am/pm clocks?
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were torched. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was just me and a few other people who also couldn’t tell time.

April 4, 2006
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple mini baguettes and a bunch of bananas to supplement. I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, lying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling and nodding. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
I put my index finger up, the international sign for “wait a minute,” and went to the bar car to grab four cups. I took some Adderall too, knowing that it was no longer going to be a Tylenol PM type of night. Drugs allow you to execute hairpin turns like an F1 driver.
Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they stood and received their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all good and drunk, telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; four guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dad thoughts.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train and ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like city; the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of walking and smoking, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel.” They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was. Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. I wanted to thank them to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me in what I assumed was Czech for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics. Only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad. When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Nevercomment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in the middle of the night. It’s best to just listen.

When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. It looked like the Catacombs, minus the bones. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon because it was my grandfather’s name, and because I’ve never known a sane Simon. When I was a kid, I went to camp with a Simon who got expelled for torturing animals. And then there was the Simon I knew in Iowa whose party trick was chewing glass and swallowing it. Tons of deviant Simons are roaming the earth unchecked, and it worries me.
Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday.” (The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX). She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was more of a single-cheek, shy smirk, than an all-out smile. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows, and was dressed casually, in blue jeans and a V-neck sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I can usually spot a fellow speed freak, so I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a stumble until the bars opened so he could extend his bender another day.
*
April 5, 2006
When I came down to the common area the next morning, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. Again, I’m looking at you, London. I was impressed the way she carried herself in the kitchen, and by her motherly sensibilities. She took on the role of “hostel mom” naturally, making sure everyone had a homemade meal before embarking on the day. That really attracted me. (Freud would have another field day with me liking mom-types).
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. It’s so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class Americans wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happen in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were dating.
*
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: We are, Johnny… I’m the umpire so I have final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick.
“Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular in its’ simplicity. It reminded me of a hotel conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer.
When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We pulled up seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked the beers over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on out we were old friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid onto the table. I knew moonshine when I saw it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could see straight. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others cackled. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech music and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling. Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching like Dave used to. Every time we got close, he’d scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: (sarcastically) Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar, where we drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: Running from my feelings? Trying to become my own man? I’m not totally sure anymore. Since my dad died last year, I just can’t stop speeding, that’s all I know.
Caroline: I understand.
Me: Do you?
Caroline: My younger brother died in a car crash last year.
Me: So, you’re doing the same thing?
Caroline: Yeah. I keep telling myself that running away from something means you’re running towards something else, but lately it hasn’t been working. So, I came here to forget myself altogether.
Me: How’s that working?
Caroline: It’s not really. Grief is just a cunt.
Me: Same and same.
Caroline: How about we run together and if that makes it any better?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I hear Bratislava is nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t watch it between now and tomorrow.

From time to time, I try to improve my Lightroom catalog’s structure to better organize my photos — and while going through my Prague photos, I started noticing patterns in the places I shoot. Sometimes, I go to certain areas on purpose because I know they’re great for photos (or I just want to explore something unfamiliar). Other times, I’m just wandering around without a plan and somehow end up at these familiar places. I realized there are certain locations where I feel more comfortable shooting and where I consistently come home with photos I’m proud of.
Also, I’ve recently received multiple questions on Glass about the best street photography spots in Prague. So, after having lived in Prague and walked its streets for almost two years now (often with a camera in my bag or in my hand), I thought it might be helpful to write about some of these recommended spots.
If you’re visiting Prague, or even if you live here and are looking for good places for street photography, these might be useful for you too.
Let’s start with one of my favorites, a place that always seems to offer something new: the area around the National Theatre (aka Národní divadlo).
The National Theatre is an impressive building with its grand, neo-classical design right on the banks of the river Vltava. What makes this spot truly stand out, though, is the building behind it: the New Stage (Nová scéna), or as the locals call it, “The Ice Cube”. The New Stage couldn’t be more different — it’s modernist (brutalist, to be exact), boxy, and covered in textured glass panels that bounce the light, sometimes in unexpected ways. The contrast between these two buildings, side by side, makes for some great photos, especially if you like playing with old vs. new themes.
But to be a bit cliché here, the buildings are just half of the story. The real magic happens in the life around them. The narrow tram stop in front, with its old red Tatra T3s, is always busy (but not chaotic) with people lined up in a single row, waiting, boarding, or rushing to catch their ride. The open space around the theatre adds a sense of scale, while the narrow passages create more intimate scenes, perfect for experimenting with different compositions, perspectives, and leading lines.
The best time for shooting here is probably a sunny afternoon when the light creates deep shadows and bounces off the glass of the New Stage. This can add depth and contrast to the photos and highlight the theatre’s detailed, brown facade with a warm feel. This effect can be harder to catch in winter when the sun doesn’t rise high enough to be above the buildings. But I’ve also been here on dark, rainy days, and the scene was equally interesting.
I won’t lie — sometimes I feel like I might end up with the same shot over and over if I keep going back. But more often than not (and it surprises me!), that isn’t the case. I’ve tried to figure out what keeps me coming back, and my best answer so far is the mix of the expected and unexpected. One day, you’ll find people going about their usual routines; the next, there might be a street performer, skaters, or a temporary exhibition in the middle of the “inner square.” The stage stays the same, but the act changes. I know, this might sound like a cliché again — what else would you expect in the center of a capital city? — but I’ve found most other areas of Prague more predictable. This balance of routine and surprise, old and new, makes the surroundings of Národní Divadlo an almost endless source of inspiration. At least for me, and at least for now.
Oh, and I’ve found myself growing more fond of these brutalist buildings. And Prague certainly has a few of them. Maybe that’s part of the reason, who knows!
I think the area around the National Theatre is like a small version of what makes Prague so special from a street photography perspective. It’s got history, modern architecture, and plenty of street life. If you’re looking for a spot that will spark new ideas for street photography, this is a good place to start — maybe even the best.
Thanks for reading to the end! If you enjoyed this or have any thoughts, I’d appreciate your 👏 claps and comments — especially if you’ve already taken photos here or are planning to visit Prague with a camera.
Small note:During my preparation, I came across an article mentioning that the Ice Cube will undergo renovations starting next summer, which are expected to last for several years. So, you might want to hurry up and visit before it starts!

Which part of Himachal are you from?I am actually not from Himachal, but from Madhya Pradesh.But you’re a Thakur?Yes, MP as well has Thakurs.
This is how my first interaction with most people at Himachal Pradesh (the northern state that hosts my workplace IIT Mandi) begins, people with last name Thakur being omnipresent here. However, perhaps the most famous Thakur was from West Bengal (a state in the East of India), and interestingly, he is known more commonly as a Tagore in India. At Prague — the city of hundred spires — though, my stay was booked at Thakurova — the Thakur street — and so I knew I would be welcome at Czechia.
My trip to Boston (recall Tryst with America?) had made me acquaintance with Prof. Jan Vitek’s group at Northeastern University. I met him again during ECOOP 2019 (recall Romance at London?) — we knew we were working in similar areas — so he suggested I visit his laboratory at Czech Technical University, where I would hopefully be able to formalize a working relationship. And thus the seed to a trip to Prague — one of my most memorable trips ever — was sown.
In general I would have been worried about the cold weather at Prague in January. However, having settled after the London trip at Mandi, in one of the coldest states of India, I wasn’t much excited (read worried) about the weather. This, however, also translated to not being prepared for the trip at all. My first teaching semester at IIT Mandi ended in December, and it was only after that, that I started planning a trip — my longest abroad till date — to Prague in January. Two things I was more thoughtful about, though, were (i) The Visa; and (ii) The Trip to Delhi — you will get to know a very suspenseful story about both in Rendezvous with Athena. TLDR: The Visa was smooth, I travelled to Delhi a day before this time, and hence obtained a comfortable flight hopping for an hour at Sharjah (the place I knew from childhood for Cricket matches).
Prague is known to be a beautiful city, and a very welcoming one for tourists. I was supposed to stay 12 nights at a hostel-cum-hotel (wrongly known as a dorm) named Masaryk Colej. The second word indicates its association with the college CVUT (Czech Technical University, in English). Travel from the airport was quite comfortable: you buy an hourly ticket for public travel in Prague and can then take any bus, tram, or metro — very convenient for those who don’t understand the currency or the local addresses. So I took a bus and a tram (Pristi zastavka) and reached the hotel. First surprise: I was provided with a map to find my room! And indeed, the map was damn useful — you need to pass through a cobweb of rooms (smelling the varieties of food college guys keep cooking in there) to finally reach the corridor that forms the “hotel” part of the huge building. I needed the map on quite a few occasions (specially when I decided to wander around the building trying to get a glimpse of the food).
I used to walk daily to the university, take the lift to the 13th floor (tried the stairs one day!), and come back in the evening. Pretty standard. So what I would do next, is to mainly discuss the interesting trips — solo as well as group — along with the classical places I visited, the people I met, and the heart-warming experiences that I got in the extremely cold weather (subzero on almost all days). Not to forget the funny stories surrounding the food!
This was the first time I was visiting a place that’s famous for its exotic food — but almost all non-veg. The first day I located a Pizza outlet with vegetarian options, about 1.5 miles from my hotel. I had taken my warmest clothes, but God it was really difficult following Google Map as you need to take your gloves off (I got enlightened about touchscreen-enabled gloves much later). Being in Europe I knew I didn’t have to worry much about tips and the phrases for taking home versus dining-in as in the US (Europe and India have pretty much similar terminologies, owing to history). Breakfasts were taken care of by the hotel (with two kinds of cupcakes, orange juice, toast, and cheese forming the 365-day menu). Lunches (and some dinner outings on weekdays): I knew I would have enough expertise from the lab in sailing through the university canteen. However, things became adventurous when I decided to try the hotel restaurant for a dinner:
Me: “Which all options in the menu are vegetarian?”She: [After the previous sentence being looped over 20 times]: “Yes, please sit; we will bring you vegetarian.”
On table I get something that looks very muttonish. After making some noise the chef came out of the kitchen; he understood some English and told I could get a replacement without paying again.
Me: “Which dish will you get for me?”He: “Vegetarian.”
Finally I got some cauliflower (in its purest vegetarian, read raw, form) and some fried (read oil-soaked) potatoes. I ate about 30% from my plate, then boiled MTR Poha (puffed rice) carried from home in the hot water obtained from the geyser-that-actually-worked-only-in-the-morning, and knew this was the end of trying out my luck at the hotel (apart from breakfast). On the remaining days I mostly sticked to the long menu of a Chinese restaurant next door (147 dishes, 3 vegetarian), an occasional Pizza from the chilly-walk place, and my MTR Pohas cooked with the morning-only geyser.
However, one night we had a fine dinner at an Indian restaurant (where I again found that Indians have a much stronger digestive system, think spices); I tried some tasty soups with two new friends on a beautiful evening; and on the last day finally tried the national dish (which happens to be vegetarian) — Fried cheese:
As indicated before, Prague is perhaps the city with the most convenient public transport: You can just install an app and charge it with your card for a day (not expensive at all), get a barcode that is your ticket, and travel as you want in any tram, bus, metro, or train. Moreover, the city is very-well covered — you perhaps don’t need to walk more than a few hundred meters anywhere — you will have nicely maintained, well-timed, clean-and-safe public transport available at the blink of an eye. I had listed down a large number of places to visit, and divided them into two days: Day 1 and Day 2, for the Saturday and the Sunday.
If you followed me in America, you know that the first thing on my list in a city that has a zoo, has to be a zoo. So Saturday began with visiting one of the best places hosting animals in the world: The Prague Zoo. Unlike the Zoo at Washington DC, at Prague you are welcomed with the star cast quite near to the entrance:
I spent nearly 3 hours at the zoo, walking about 8 kilometers inside, and ended with a team of as-tall-as-can-get Giraffes, and as-cute-as-can-get Penguins:
The next stop was The Old Town across Charles bridge (challenge: find the river in the lab-view above). Old Town has several attractions from the times Czechia was part of the Soviet Union, with several churches and castles at every turn. While the Prague Castle reminds one of Hogwarts, the Astronomical Clock attracts a huge crowd every hour for witnessing one of the many scientific marvels associated with the same (read more on Wikipedia):
Charles Bridge is a heritage on its own, with so many activities and picture-spots around that you can spend hours walking across and yet find something every time you cross! A beautiful view of the colorful city follows:
I finished traversing the Old Town by filling my bag at a shop full of candies (and forgetting the bag mid-way during my return journey)!
Having explored the crowded places the previous day, I decided to spend a solo Sunday climbing hills and exploring castles — both being rare opportunities in a vibrant city. The day was cold and hazy, but I walked and walked like crazy.
Vysehrad is an old castle in a bit far-off location, and should be traveled in broad day-light, is what I was told. Though the far-off part was true, I found the place full of people craving for silent time amidst the hustle and bustle of the cheerful city. You could sit there for hours with a book in hand, appreciating the rare greenery in the coldest of months.
The last I went was The Petrin Hill — reminiscent of the hikes I do around Mandi. I went up via a crowded rope-way and came down exploring solitary paths watching the city of hundred spires; as you descend, you realize every climb has its end, but the walk downhill doesn’t necessarily take you down.
If you ever visit Prague, do roam around the colorful streets, but take a moment walking up/down the Petrin Hill, sitting on that bench I couldn’t, and wondering “what to eat next” :-)
I returned back via Warsaw; the trip was prepended with a day’s stay with an about-to-be-engaged friend at New Delhi, and appended with a trip to Kolkata — a city where you drive ahead with both the legs on breaks (for preserving its classical past) — to attend the engagement of the same (more about my old-and-gold friends some time later!).
The series had promised an article every few weeks: it started swiftly, but has been going on rather slow. For me, the year 2020 has been full of remembering (read missing) the travels from 2019, and avid readers are in for many more write-ups. For now, an assurance is to have a few more articles than those promised in the intro A Traveling Year, one of them being exclusively on the rather long airport stays and flight journeys (of course with feedback on the food) I have had in the travel-rich year! So keep reading, and stay on…

Since arriving in Eastern Europe, I’ve never experienced cloudy weather until now. At 7 in the morning, I dragged my tired body out for breakfast. Our accommodation offers an outdoor terrace, allowing us to enjoy the warm sunshine while savoring bread and morning orange juice.
It seems that Czech is as famous for its apples as it is for its dark beer. Everywhere we went, apples were being sold, and there were many bread and dishes containing apples. Although I didn’t crave any special taste, thinking about my growling stomach as I walked, I grabbed an apple and hurriedly set off for Prague again today.
Havel Market & Trdelník
We went straight to the traditional market in Prague that we had been eager to visit, Havel Market. Unfortunately, there were a few things that left us slightly disappointed:

On the night of 20–21 August 1968, Soviet troops appeared in Czechoslovakia and on the streets of Prague to quell the growing movement of liberalisation, a movement known as the ‘Prague Spring’. Here, we summarize the events of the Prague Spring, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and its aftermath.
Socialism with a Human Face
On 5 January 1968, amongst growing discontent of economic failure, the Czechoslovakian communist party appointed Alexander Dubcek as its new chairman. Dubcek promised reform, democratisation and, using Nikita Khrushchev‘s phrase, ‘socialism with a human face’. He eased press censorship, allowed greater artistic and cultural freedom, pardoned victims of political purges, eased travel restrictions, promised to guarantee civil rights and liberties and permitted a degree of democratic reform.
But while urging democratic communism, Dubcek remained loyal to Moscow and at no point was he advocating the dismissal of his or the country’s socialist principles. The Soviet leadership, under Leonid Brezhnev (pictured), saw it otherwise, becoming increasingly concerned with what they considered Dubcek’s treachery and Czechoslovakia’s counterrevolution.
Evidence of the transformation was immediately apparent — young men grew their hair, women wore mini skirts, anti-state newspapers appeared, films and plays long since banned by the regime reappeared, including the work of dissident playright, Vaclav Havel.
In July 1968, Brezhnev, fearing Czechoslovakian independence, met with Dubcek and demanded that he re-imposed strict communist control over his people and ordered Dubcek to reign in his ‘counter-revolutionary’ methods. Dubcek promised to compromise but over the coming weeks, it came clear to Moscow that nothing was being done. Brezhnev applied greater pressure, often ringing Dubcek and bellowing at him down the telephone.
Soviet Invasion
Meeting on 15 August, the politburo decided that enough was enough. Dubcek’s failure to bring Czechoslovakia back in line angered the Soviet Union, and on 20 August 1968, Brezhnev, with support from other Warsaw Pact leaders, ordered in the tanks. The politburo arranged it so that loyal members of the Czechoslovakian government requested Soviet help in dealing with the counterrevolutionary threat. The politburo did not want to appear asoccupiers but merely responding to pleas for help.
Half a million Soviet troops (including token numbers from Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and Poland) and 2,000 tanks moved in quickly, taking control of Prague’s airport and vital points of communication before making a forceful presence on the streets of the capital. Dubcek told his people not to resist. But if the Soviet soldier expected a warm welcome by the good people of Czechoslovakia, as Moscow had told them, they were soon disabused of the idea as Czechoslovakian youths threw stones at their tanks. But faced with such a show of strength, unarmed resistance, limited as it was, soon crumbled. Eleven Soviet soldiers and 72 civilians were killed.
‘You have let us all down’
Dubcek (pictured), rendered powerless, was, along with his immediate colleagues, arrested at gun point, hit with a rifle butt and bundled unceremoniously into an aeroplane and taken to Moscow. In Moscow, Brezhnev, with tears in his eyes, shouted at Dubcek, ‘I trusted you,’ he said, ‘you have let us all down.’
Dubcek and colleagues were forced into signing declarations of renewed loyalty to Moscow. He was returned to office in Prague, his work carefully censured. Within the year, however, he was removed from power and exiled to a minor post, first as ambassador to Turkey, then further still as a forestry inspector in Bratislava. He was replaced by Gustav Husak, a man more loyal to Moscow and devoted to the socialist cause. Czechoslovakia’s brief flirtation with reform and democracy, its Prague Spring, was over.
Husak immediately reversed Dubcek’s reforms, rid the party of its more liberal members, and imposed greater authoritarian control over the country, a process referred to as ‘normalization’. (Husak was to remain in power until the collapse of Czechoslovakia in December 1989.)
Brezhnev Doctrine
Brezhnev, in a speech in November 1968, reiterated the right of the Warsaw Pact to intervene if any Soviet satellite compromised the hegemony of the Eastern bloc by looking West. Known as the ‘Brezhnev Doctrine’, it ushered in another period of suppression, and the straitjacking of the arts and ideological strictness.
The writers and artists that led the cultural revolution of the Prague Spring had their works banned. Members of a dissident group, Charter 77, including Vaclav Havel, were imprisoned. A fan of The Beatles, Havel said he was not so much a Leninist as a Lennonist.
The Soviet invasion prompted, within the Soviet Union, the first open demonstration in its history — on 25 August 1968, several Russians demonstrated on Moscow’s Red Square, shouting ‘Shame on invaders!’ and ‘Long live the free and independent Czechoslovakia!’ The demo lasted but a few minutes but it was a start.
In Czechoslovakia also, there were minor protests against the re-imposition of authoritarian rule, most notably on 16 January 1969 when a student, Jan Palach, set himself on fire in Prague’s Wenceslas Square. Palach was to die of his injuries three days later.

Prague seemed like the wisest choice for my next destination, given they were still on the Koruna (information I acquired from the ladies in Paris). They had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
I didn’t know much about Prague, other than that my friend, Kevin, told me I needed to go because “you can get wasted there for 5 bucks.” That was enough for me. Kevin always knows what he’s talking about. The only problem was the overnight, 14-hour train ride. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to romp. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost 8 Euros/night (about $10 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be two and a half hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand clocks? What the fuck are we doing here? Come on.
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were burned and shit on. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was me and a few other people, who I assume also couldn’t tell time.
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple more baguettes and a bunch of bananas (I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them), to supplement the Adderall I was going to take once the ride began. There’s nothing like Adderall when you need to kill 14 hours. Shit, you could stare at a clock for the entire time and still enjoy it. At least that’s how the drug made me feel.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, laying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
“I’ll be right back,” I told them.
I went to the bar cart and asked for four cups. Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they receive their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all loose as geese. We took turns telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed. Words, as usual, were unnecessary.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; 4 guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dark thoughts. Anything to avoid thinking about my dad.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train. Or maybe it was the second transfer I screwed up; I can’t remember. Either way, I ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like I was in Prague, the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of smoking and walking around, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel”. They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was? Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis in it and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. Without their kindness, I would have had to spend another night on a train station floor. I wanted to thank them, to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me, in what I assumed was Czech, for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics (only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad). When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Never comment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in a foreign country at two in the morning. It’s best to just listen and agree, then form your opinions later.
When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon. It was my grandfather’s name, and he was a miserable, racist old bastard. One time he told me he didn’t want my Indian friend, Naveen, over at the house because he, “wreaked of curry.” I used to pray for him to die. And when he did, I helped myself to his collection of Member’s Only jackets.
Irish Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: “How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.”
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday”. The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX.
She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was beautiful, but she didn’t flash it often. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. I can always spot a fellow speed freak. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a walk until the bars opened. For better or worse, I was now a part of a crew.
I slept like a drunken baby until noon the next day. When I came down to the common area, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. I was impressed, even turned on. She was motherly as well, a quality that inherently attracts me. I appreciated the way she made sure everyone was fed, before eating herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Hostel mom. All hostels had one, but like in life, many of them stink.
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. Its so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class American people wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had the whole two floor almost all to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happens in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were on a date.
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: Johnny… The umpire has the final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way there. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick. “Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular. Some might not have liked it, but I sure did. It reminded me of a Day’s Inn conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar, that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer. When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We up pulled seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked them over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on we were all best friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid, onto the table. I know moonshine when I see it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could stand. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others laughed. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech radio music, and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling.
Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that, and we stumbled home.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching. Every time we got close, he would scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar. We drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day, at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So, why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: I’m running.
Caroline: From what?
Me: Myself. Since my dad died, I feel like I can’t stop. If I do, I’ll have time to think. And I don’t want to think.
Caroline. I understand.
Me: Why are you here?
Caroline: Same reason, really. My younger brother died last year. When I’m home in Perth, I can’t get him out of my mind. He died in a car accident, along with our dogs.
Me: That’s terrible.
Caroline: How about we run together?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I heard Bratislava was nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t. Tomorrow we can take a bus. It’s a short ride.
By the time I got up the next morning, Simon had already weaseled his way into our plans. During breakfast, Caroline gave me a look as if to apologize. I couldn’t be upset though; Simon was a persistent one, I would have given in too.
Simon: Let me get some more of that speed. That was good shit.
Me: Goddamn you, Simon.
I gave him the 10mg pill, which he took immediately, in front of everyone.
Simon: Hey Johnny, we’re going to get pissed today, aren’t we?
Me: You just watch yourself, Ok? And please, don’t open any more beers with your mouth. It makes me sick.
It was only a 2-hour ride from Prague to Bratislava, but that didn’t deter Simon from bringing along a whole case of beer. He bought it though, and carried it, so I didn’t complain. Plus, it was nice to get some reciprocation after getting him high with my good Amsterdam weed for the past two days. The beer was the only luggage he took. I didn’t ask if he had more clothes, or any belongings at all, but I was curious. Best not to ask questions you don’t want the answers to.
He was 2 beers deep before we even boarded. With each one, he’d covertly pop the cap off then put it back on, before pretending to open it with his teeth, giving me a childish look in the process. At that point I’d stopped caring, but he wouldn’t let it go. He was an instigator that way. I’ve never understood why some people show affection by teasing. You can only pull off teasing if you’re funny and have tact. Otherwise, you just sound like an annoying asshole. Timing is everything.
Caroline and I sat next to each other, while Simon sat behind us. He smelled like he hadn’t showered in a week, and he probably hadn’t. When the metal chains on his leather jacket clanged against the poor old woman sitting beside him, she clutched her bag and turned towards the window. I felt terrible for her, having to sit next to a drunken stink bomb like that for 2 hours. He was disgusting.
Speaking of disgusting… I was always embarrassed when my dad and I went out in public together. He was impossible not to stare at because of how fat and unkempt he was. And I was his son, so I got stares too. Food is the worst drug in that way. Most addictions aren’t noticeable to the naked eye, but with food, there’s no way to hide it, unless you purge. My mom always told me that everyone is too caught up in their own lives to notice other people’s insecurities, but I never believed her. I knew they were looking, wondering how a child like me could come from a man like that. I could feel their indictments of him as a father; I could feel their pity. I felt it all. Those feelings have never left me, even long after his death. I can still feel those eyeballs on me.
It was a peaceful first hour. Caroline and I read from our books while knocking knees. The unspoken intimacy was lovely. She was on her second read of a Virginia Woolf book I can’t remember the name of, just like I was on my second read of my Hunter Thompson book. We both sipped our beers and enjoyed the nice cross breeze wisping through the bus. The sun was out, and we were in just the right place at just the right time.
With only about 15 minutes left in the ride, I reached back to grab another beer from the box on Simon’s lap. That’s when I saw the flashing lights behind us. It was a police van, and it was rapidly approaching. When it got closer it became clear that we were the ones being pulled over.
Me: Uh, what the fuck is going on?”
Simon: It’s usually just standard shite. Don’t worry.
Me: Usually?!
Several police officers boarded the bus, all of whom were holding automatic rifles and looking very serious. I swear, in Europe everyone with even a modicum of authority gets a machine gun. They went around checking passports. When they got to me, I was terrified. My bag and pockets were filled with weed, hash, and a bunch of loose Adderall pills. Also, I was American. Being an American in Europe is almost as bad as being black in America. Boy, being black in Europe must be double awful.
I handed the cop my passport, and instead of handing it back, he put it in his pocket and escorted me off the bus. I was the only one singled out. Everyone else just sat comfortably, drinking their beers. The jig was finally up, and my worst nightmare was coming true. “If this is what happens in the movie Hostel, I’m going to kill Caroline for not warning me,” I thought to myself.
He asked me a bunch of questions that I obviously didn’t understand, while repeatedly checking my passport and shaking his head from side to side. It was like I was being questioned by a squirrel. I had no clue what he wanted from me or how I could appease him. I tried to look like an upstanding gentleman by buttoning up my cardigan and straightening my posture, but it didn’t seem to be working. He saw right through me.
I could see Simon in the window of the bus. He was giving me the international sign for throat-slashing. I wasn’t sure if he was implying that I should kill myself to avoid Slovakian prison, or if he was telling me I should find a way to slit the officer’s throat and escape. Probably the latter, knowing him. Caroline too had come to the window. I could see the concern on her face. If she was scared, I knew I was in trouble.
They had me out on the side of the road for ten agonizing minutes while they talked on their radios. The bus driver came out at one point to ask what the holdup was, and they swiftly sent him back on the bus. Now, everyone was concerned. I got Caroline’s attention through the window.
Me: Caroline, grab a pen… My name is Sam Rosenberg, NOT John McEnroe. My mom’s name is Audrey. She lives in Northbrook, Illinois. Please tell her —
Then, it all ended, just like that. No bag check, no pat down, no nothing. They just sent me on my not so merry way, with my passport. The bus driver gave me a snide look, like I’d messed up his schedule, but I didn’t care. I’d dodged another bullet. Simon opened a beer with his teeth and handed it to me.
Simon: This deserves a celebration.
Our hostel wasn’t the most fashionable, but it was cheap, and right downtown. The room fit 8 people. It was the three of us and 5 Italian guys who were all clearly friends. When we got to the room, they were eating spaghetti with their shirts off. It was wildly apropos. When they offered us each a bowl, Caroline and I politely declined. Simon, on the other hand, scarfed one down in less than a minute.
Simon: You call this pasta? It’s shite, mate. Sorry to tell you.
They didn’t understand.
Italian Guy: Si, pasta. Prego, prego.
Me: Prego?
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Caroline: (understanding the double entendre) Not the brand, Sam.
Simon: Ahem, his name is Johnny.
Caroline: It means “you’re welcome.”
Me: Ah, grazie.
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Right down the street from our hostel was a bar called The Dubliner. It looked exactly like you’d expect it to look. There’s no need to even describe it. Irish bars are perfect that way, you always get what you expect, regardless of the country you’re in. The food and liquor are the same, as is the décor. They are, if nothing else, reliable. And reliability is everything.
Caroline and I sat at a table together, drinking Guinness, while Simon roamed around the bar swilling Jameson and accosting random strangers. “I’m here with John McEnroe!” he’d tell anyone who’d listen. He was blacked out. 12 beers in 2 hours will do that to you.
Simon got punched in the face and thrown out within an hour. I didn’t see it but apparently, he spit in some guy’s face after being called a cunt. Then thee guy decked him with a single punch. As someone who used the word so often, I’d expect Simon to be less sensitive to being called one himself. Caroline and I were tossed too because we came with him. He tried fighting every single person on the way out, but Caroline and I just stood there and watched. There was no way I was fighting on his behalf. The last time I did that was in 4th grade when a friend got jumped for using a racial slur. I have regretted it ever since and still think of the guy as a racist piece of shit.
When the hullabaloo concluded, Simon’s face was bloodied, but he still wanted to drink.
Me: You need to go back to the hostel. They won’t let you into a bar with blood all over your face and shirt. That’s surely a universal rule.
Simon: Fuck that. When someone in Dublin gets punched in the face, the bar buys them drinks.
Me: We are not in Dublin.
Caroline: Sam and I are going to eat. You can’t come. You need to rest.
To my amazement, Simon heeded her advice and stumbled back to the hostel to crash. I felt sorry for the Italians because I knew he’d finish their spaghetti and/or try to fight them. At least it was five against one, and Simon could hardly stand, so I wasn’t too worried about them.
Caroline and I set out to find the nicest restaurant we could. We’d both been skimping on money for weeks and finally wanted to splurge now that we were amongst good company. We walked around for half an hour holding hands, chatting about food. Caroline told me she used to cook for her late brother, “Damby,” as she called him (because she couldn’t say “Danny” when she was little). She’d make him minced meat pies on Sundays after church. They were his favorite, and he’d eat them inside-out, saving the crust for last (I do the same). The recipe came from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother before her.
I told her about my Bubbie, and the fried latkes she’d make for me after school. I always thought the jelly would cool them down faster, but it really just cooled the exterior, lulling me into a burnt mouth. I never learned my lesson. We traded food story after food story, our faces lit up, until we had none left.
Food is the easiest way to make bonds, Bourdain taught me that, and I’ve always found it to be true. We all eat.
Downtown Bratislava was way more beautiful than I’d expected. The streets were cobblestone, but the buildings were modern; a dichotomy that somehow worked. It perfectly combined the old world with the new. And the place oozed romanticism. It was like a poem come to life. Everything Disneyland claims to be, Bratislava actually was. If you’re proposing to someone, I suggest doing it there. You will no doubt get a “yes.”
We found a white-tablecloth, French restaurant to dine in. They didn’t seem to care about our casual attire even though the place was fancy, which impressed me. Everyone who can afford a meal should be accommodated, regardless of their attire. Miss me with that classist shit. Before ordering we decided we’d share so we could try more dishes. We got escargot to start. Always start with escargot if they have it. Then we had an omelet, followed by a quiche. For our main courses we shared duck confit and beef bourguignon. Everything was insanely good, like eyes rolling back and moaning good. The price didn’t matter, though they were on the Krona too, so it only came out to what amounted to $40 USD.
We were enveloped in each other that night. The vibes were electric. We flirted and teased, properly, on the walk back. We were about to enter the hostel, when Caroline grabbed my arm.
Caroline: Do you have a girlfriend?
Me: No. Do you have a boyfriend?
Caroline: No.
I knew an opportunity when I saw one, so I leaned in and gave her a kiss.
Caroline: (Pulling away) Just kidding, I do.
Me: What?!
Caroline: Haha, you should see your face.
Me: Why did you do that?
Caroline: To fuck with you.
Me: I don’t appreciate that.
Caroline: (mockingly) I’m Sam, and I don’t appreciate jokes even though I was a comedian. Shut up and kiss me again, you sensitive man you.
I kissed her again, this time pulling her close.
Me: Whoa, that was awesome. Let’s do that more.
I usually say some very awkward shit during and after moments of passion. It’s like the side effect I get from a boner is Tourette’s. I’ve been known to say “thank you” after I cum. It’s not something I’m proud of.
Caroline: I have an idea… How about we go somewhere else, without Simon, and pretend to be a couple? Like, just for a few days. We can go our separate ways after that.
Me: I dig that. But how are we going to get rid of Simon?
Caroline: Leave that up to me.
We made out for a few more minutes before going upstairs. Simon was still passed out, and the Italian guys weren’t back yet, so we laid in my bunk and dry humped quietly for a little while. Part of me couldn’t believe I was hooking up with such an awesome chick, but the other part wished it was Meghan. I kept my mouth shut, as to not ruin our moment, but I felt guilty, like I was using her. Before going to bed, I wrote in my journal:
Why are you like this? Who are you trying to spare in this situation? You’re not even dating Meghan, and Caroline REALLY likes you. You don’t have to be in love with her to have some fun. I mean, you just had sex with a prostitute, how is this worse than that? Ignore your silly morals for once and take a chance. Put yourself out there. Meghan would want you to.
It was easier to ditch Simon than we’d expected because I’m pretty sure he had a concussion. I tried to wake him up a few times, because I knew you weren’t supposed to sleep in that situation, but he kept telling me to fuck off. Caroline finally had enough.
Caroline: Simon, Sam and I are leaving. We will say a prayer for you. Drink water and don’t look directly into bright lights for a few days.
Simon: You cunts. You’re going to leave me here, like this? Sam, I need more speed.
Me: No. And it’s Mr. McEnroe to you.
Caroline pulled me out of the room by my arm before we could hear any more of his pleading. I was insulted by everything Simon did, but that demand infuriated me. I wanted to go back in there and smother him with a pillow. I guess that’s what I get for always seeing the best in people, and for sharing my drugs. Friends like these, eh dude?
Caroline and I went right to the train stop after buying some candy for the trip. She loved the sour stuff. The sourer, the better. In my experience, sweet people like sour candy, and sour people like sweet candy. I’ve ran the numbers, trust me. We didn’t know where to go, so we looked at a map on the wall.
Me: So where to ma’am?
Caroline: Why don’t you just close your eyes and point?
Without waiting for my response, she got behind me and covered my eyes. Then, she spun me around a few times, before placing me back in front of the map. I pointed to a spot.
Caroline: I hear Vienna is nice.

Hey there, fellow wanderers!
Picture this: a slightly panicked introvert standing in the middle of Old Town Square at 6 AM, clutching a lukewarm coffee and wondering what on earth she’s doing in Prague all by herself. That was me, three years ago — more anxiety than passport stamps, about to embark on what would become the most life-changing week ever.
Spoiler alert: I didn’t just fall in love with Prague’s fairy-tale architecture and ridiculously good goulash (seriously, the food is incredible!). I discovered a version of myself I never knew existed — the one who could navigate cobblestone streets confidently, eat dinner alone without checking her phone every five seconds, and actually enjoy her own company.
And honestly? I’m pretty sure you will too.
After four years of guiding tourists around Turkey’s stunning coastlines, I thought I had this whole travel thing figured out. I knew how to handle cranky tourists, navigate crowds without losing anyone, and make sure everyone felt safe and entertained. I was the person with all the answers, the backup plans, the emergency snacks.
But here’s the kicker — I’d never actually traveled just for me. Wild, right?
Every trip was about managing other people’s experiences, schedules, and expectations. I was always “on,” always responsible for someone else’s good time. Sound familiar?
So when I finally booked that solo trip to Prague, I honestly had no clue what I was getting myself into. My friends thought I was either incredibly brave or slightly unhinged (jury’s still out on that one). My family worried I’d spend the whole week talking to pigeons and eating sad hotel room crackers.
Oh boy, was I wrong about everything.
The real transformation didn’t happen at the famous Prague Castle or on that Instagram-perfect Charles Bridge everyone raves about. Nope. It happened on day three, in this tiny café tucked away in Lesser Town, where I spent two glorious hours reading a book, sipping what might have been the best coffee of my life, and realizing something mind-blowing:
I was genuinely enjoying my own company for the first time in… well, maybe ever.
Okay, let me be completely honest with you — Prague totally spoiled me for other cities. It’s like the universe took notes on what anxious introverts need and designed the perfect solo travel playground.
Here’s why Prague works so beautifully for us nervous first-timers:
It’s Ridiculously Safe (Even for Overthinkers Like Me)
I walked everywhere. Day, night, through winding medieval streets that looked straight out of a fairy tale. The scariest thing that happened? Getting mildly turned around near Wenceslas Square (which, fun fact, isn’t actually a square but more like a really long street — Prague loves keeping you on your toes!).
The city center is compact, well-lit, and there are always people around. Plus, Czech people are generally pretty reserved and respectful, which means you won’t deal with aggressive street harassment or pushy vendors trying to sell you overpriced “authentic” souvenirs every five minutes.
Basically, Prague lets you dip your toes into solo travel without throwing you into the deep end.
Your Wallet Will Actually Love You
One of my biggest solo travel fears was accidentally bankrupting myself on overpriced tourist food. You know that panic when you realize you just paid €25 for a sad sandwich near the Eiffel Tower? Yeah, Prague laughs at that nonsense.
I ate like an absolute queen for the price of a mediocre airport meal back home. Traditional Czech meals with beer (yes, beer!) often cost less than a single appetizer in most major European cities. This means you can actually enjoy yourself without constantly calculating exchange rates and having mini panic attacks about your credit card bill.
It’s Like Living Inside a Disney Movie (But Real)
I’m not being dramatic when I say Prague looks like someone took every fairy-tale castle, medieval fantasy, and romantic European dream and smooshed them together into one impossibly beautiful city. Walking through the streets genuinely feels like you’ve stepped into a storybook.
Which is perfect when you’re writing your own adventure story, right?
Day 1: Arrival and the Classic “What Have I Done?” Moment
I checked into my adorable little hotel in New Town (pro tip: stay somewhere central but not smack in the middle of tourist chaos), dumped my overpacked suitcase, and immediately felt that familiar flutter of anxiety.
You know the feeling — that voice in your head going, “Congratulations, you’ve officially made a terrible decision. Enjoy eating alone for a week, weirdo.”
Instead of hiding in my room scrolling social media like my introvert brain suggested, I forced myself to take a gentle walk toward the Powder Gate and Municipal House. The architecture literally stopped me in my tracks. I stood there for a solid ten minutes just gawking at all the intricate details on the Municipal House facade like some kind of architectural tourist (which I totally was).
That evening, I found this cozy restaurant with bar seating — my secret weapon for solo dining — and had my first taste of svíčková. I was super skeptical about meat drowning in cream sauce (it sounds questionable, right?), but oh my goodness, it was absolutely incredible.
The elderly Czech woman sitting next to me smiled and nodded approvingly when I practically licked my plate clean. My first genuine human connection of the trip, and it was over mutual appreciation of comfort food. Perfect.
Day 2: Playing Tourist (But Flying Solo Style)
Old Town Square was everything I’d drooled over in Instagram photos and somehow even more magical in person. The famous Astronomical Clock show happens every hour, and yes, it’s honestly a bit underwhelming (sorry, Prague tourism board!), but there’s something genuinely special about being part of that collective moment with strangers from around the world.
The real treasure was the Church of Our Lady Before Týn with its dramatic Gothic spires that look like something straight out of a Tim Burton movie. I found a nearby café, ordered another incredible coffee (Prague’s coffee game is seriously underrated), and spent an hour sketching the towers in my travel journal while people-watching.
This became my daily ritual — finding quiet spots to observe and actually process what I was seeing instead of just snapping photos and moving on.
The Jewish Quarter hit me right in the feels in ways I hadn’t expected. The weight of history, the stunning beauty of the Spanish Synagogue with its intricate Moorish design, the sobering reality of the Old Jewish Cemetery — it reminded me why solo travel can be so powerful. You can take all the time you need to really feel and process heavy experiences without worrying about someone else’s comfort level or schedule.
Day 3: The Charles Bridge Revelation (AKA My “I Can Do This” Moment)
Here’s where things got interesting. I dragged my not-a-morning-person self out of bed at sunrise (definitely not easy!) to experience Charles Bridge without the usual crowds of selfie-stick wielding tourists.
Standing there in the golden morning light, with just a few dedicated joggers and adorable dog walkers for company, I had what I can only describe as a moment of pure, unexpected contentment.
I wasn’t frantically taking selfies or checking how many likes my last post got. I was just… there. Present. Enjoying the view and my own thoughts without any distractions or obligations.
It sounds almost too simple, but when you’re used to constantly managing other people’s experiences or being “on” all the time, these moments of genuine solitude feel absolutely revolutionary.
Lesser Town became my favorite neighborhood that day. It’s like stepping through a portal into the past, with narrow cobblestone streets (wear good shoes, trust me!) and baroque buildings painted in the most gorgeous soft pastels.
I stumbled upon the John Lennon Wall, completely covered in colorful graffiti and Beatles lyrics, and learned from a friendly local that it had been a symbol of peace and freedom during Communist times. These unexpected mini-history lessons happen constantly when you’re traveling solo — you actually have time to read the plaques, strike up random conversations, and really absorb the stories instead of rushing to the next photo op.
Day 4: Castle Conquering and Confidence Building
Prague Castle day meant serious uphill walking (note to past self: ALWAYS pack your most comfortable walking shoes!). The castle complex is absolutely massive — we’re talking small-city-on-a-hill massive. St. Vitus Cathedral made me actually gasp out loud with its soaring Gothic arches and stained glass windows that look like giant jewels.
But honestly? The real highlight was Golden Lane, this absolutely charming street of tiny, colorful houses where castle guards and craftspeople used to live. I spent almost an hour exploring each miniature dwelling, imagining the daily lives of people who once called these dollhouse-sized homes their own.
The confidence boost of navigating this enormous complex completely by myself — reading maps, making decisions about what to see and what to skip based purely on my own interests — felt like a masterclass in trusting my own judgment.
Day 5: Hidden Gems and Personal Discoveries
Vyšehrad Fortress became my absolute favorite discovery. It’s way less crowded than Prague Castle but equally stunning, with incredible views over the Vltava River and the city spread out below like a living postcard.
The peaceful cemetery where famous Czech artists and writers are buried became my spot for quiet reflection. I know that sounds morbid, but there was something deeply moving about walking among the elaborate tombstones and thinking about all the creative souls who once called Prague home.
I packed a little picnic lunch (cheese, bread, and local fruit from a market) and spent hours just sitting on the fortress walls, watching boats drift down the river and thinking about my life back home. These moments of pure solitude were becoming addictive in the absolute best way.
Day 6: Confidence in Full Bloom
By this point, I was navigating Prague’s winding streets like I’d lived there for months. I’d found my favorite café (Café Louvre, where Einstein apparently used to hang out — how cool is that?), discovered hidden gardens perfect for morning reading sessions, and even ventured into neighborhoods completely outside the tourist bubble.
The Museum of Alchemists and Magicians was wonderfully weird and perfectly Prague — quirky, mysterious, and slightly magical. That evening, I treated myself to dinner at this fancy restaurant I would never have chosen if I were worried about accommodating someone else’s preferences or budget.
Eating alone at a white tablecloth establishment felt like such a grown-up, confident thing to do. The waiter was lovely, recommending wine pairings and chatting about his favorite Prague neighborhoods. Another reminder that most people are genuinely kind when you’re open to connection.
Day 7: Saying Goodbye to My Transformed Self
My last morning, I made one final pilgrimage to Charles Bridge for sunrise. This time, I wasn’t nervous or uncertain about being alone. I was simply a woman who had spent a week getting to know herself in one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
The difference in my confidence from day one to day seven was honestly shocking. I’d gone from anxious and uncertain to genuinely excited about solo adventures.
Solo Doesn’t Equal Lonely (Revolutionary Concept, I Know)
This was my biggest fear going in and my most surprising revelation coming out. I had rich, meaningful experiences every single day. Sometimes through brief but lovely interactions with locals or fellow travelers, but mostly through rediscovering the genuine joy of my own company.
I’d somehow lost that in years of constantly accommodating other people’s needs, schedules, and preferences. Prague gave it back to me.
You’re Way More Capable Than Your Anxiety Wants You to Believe
Every small decision — which charming street to wander down, where to grab lunch, how to spend an unexpected free afternoon — built my confidence muscle. By the end of the week, I was making quick, intuitive choices and trusting my instincts in ways that genuinely surprised me.
That confidence didn’t magically disappear when I got home. It showed up in work meetings, personal relationships, and daily decision-making in ways I never expected.
Slow Travel is the Secret Sauce
Without anyone else’s agenda to consider, I could linger in places that spoke to my soul and skip things that didn’t interest me. I spent an entire afternoon in the peaceful Franciscan Garden just because it felt right. I revisited my favorite café three times because the coffee was perfect and the atmosphere made me genuinely happy.
No rushing, no compromising, no “we should probably see this because it’s famous.” Just pure, authentic exploration based on what actually interested me.
Where to Stay for Maximum Comfort and Confidence
Old Town is super convenient but touristy and expensive (and honestly kind of overwhelming). I absolutely loved New Town — central enough to walk everywhere but with more authentic local flavor and much better prices.
Vinohrady is perfect if you want to feel like a temporary Prague resident, with incredible cafés and tree-lined streets that feel genuinely residential.
Pro tip: Look for places with 24-hour reception and stellar reviews from other solo female travelers. I always read reviews specifically mentioning solo travel experiences — they’re gold mines of practical information.
The Art of Solo Dining (It’s Way Easier Than Your Brain Thinks)
Prague’s café culture is absolutely perfect for solo travelers. Look for places with bar seating or communal tables where eating alone feels natural and intentional rather than awkward.
Traditional beer halls and pubs are surprisingly solo-friendly too — there’s something about the casual, communal atmosphere that makes dining alone feel completely normal. Plus, locals often eat alone, so you definitely won’t stand out.
My foolproof strategy: always carry a book or journal. It gives you something to do with your hands and makes the whole experience feel purposeful rather than like you’re waiting for someone who’s running late.
Getting Around Like You Own the Place
Prague’s public transport is excellent and super safe, but honestly, you can walk to most major attractions from the city center. The medieval layout can be confusing (I got turned around more times than I care to admit), but that’s part of the charm.
The tram system runs frequently even late at night, and it’s efficient and reliable. Get a multi-day transport pass for convenience, and always use official taxis with yellow roof lights and clear company logos.
Download offline maps before you go — Prague’s winding streets can be tricky, and you don’t want to drain your phone battery when you need GPS most.
Safety Tips That Actually Matter (Not the Scary Stuff)
Keep your bag zipped and in front of you in crowded tourist areas — pickpockets definitely target distracted visitors around major attractions like Old Town Square and Charles Bridge. Save your accommodation’s address in your phone and grab one of their business cards to keep in your wallet.
Most importantly: trust your instincts. If something feels off, remove yourself from the situation. But honestly? The biggest safety threat in Prague is falling so hard for the city that you start researching apartment rental prices (definitely guilty as charged).
Here’s what nobody tells you about solo travel: it’s not really about the destination at all. Prague was absolutely incredible, but the real journey was completely internal.
I learned to trust my judgment, genuinely enjoy my own company, and make decisions based on what I actually wanted rather than what I thought I should want or what would make other people happy.
This newfound confidence didn’t conveniently stay in Prague when I flew home. It followed me into job interviews, personal relationships, family dynamics, and daily decision-making. It fundamentally changed how I approach challenges and how I see myself in the world.
If you’re reading this and feeling that familiar flutter of excitement mixed with absolute terror, that’s your sign. That’s exactly how I felt three years ago, standing in my kitchen with a Prague guidebook, wondering if I was actually brave enough to book the trip.
Here’s the truth: I wasn’t particularly brave. I was just curious enough to feel the fear and explore anyway.
Prague is waiting for you right now. Not just the city with its stunning architecture, incredible food, and fairy-tale streets, but the version of yourself you’ll discover wandering those ancient cobblestones. The woman who can confidently navigate foreign cities, make decisions based on her own desires, and genuinely enjoy her own amazing company.
Your Prague itinerary for solo female travelers isn’t just another vacation plan — it’s an invitation to meet the most interesting person you’ll ever travel with: yourself.
So pack your curiosity, leave those doubts at home, and get ready for the most important conversation of your life. Prague is an excellent listener, and I have a feeling you might be surprised by what you discover you have to say.
Ready to start planning your own transformation? Your solo Prague adventure is just one brave click away. Trust me, your future self will thank you for being curious enough to take that first step.

Most people know Prague for its cheap beer and beautiful bridges, but did you know that the city has a blossoming art gallery scene, too?
Prague truly has something for everyone. Are you a fan of historical art? What about contemporary art? The city has it all — if you know where to look. But even if you don’t, don’t worry. That’s what this guide is for, after all!
Here’s a list of some of the best must-see galleries in Prague you can’t miss.
Fun fact: Prague’s National Gallery is one of the largest art museums in Central Europe. It has several buildings across the city. Honestly, if you want to see all of it, you might want to extend your trip by a couple of days! That’s how much art there is for you to admire.
Whether you’re interested in the old masters, Czech modernism, or international contemporary exhibitions, this gallery needs to be on your travel itinerary.
It’s a must-see for anyone who’s looking for a deep dive into Czech and European art.
I’ll admit — this one is a personal favorite of mine. There’s no better way to spend the afternoon in Prague than visiting DOX and seeing whatever exhibition they currently have on. They never miss!
DOX Centre for Contemporary Art is Prague’s leading modern art space. Here, you can expect thought-provoking exhibitions, modern architecture, and a permanent rooftop airship installation with some cozy beanbags inside.
It’s located in the Holešovice district, which is full of artistic cafés, beautiful plant stores, and small independent shops that you can get lost in. Perfect for an artsy day out!
This Prague art gallery is a must-see for contemporary art lovers.
Kampa Museum is all about modern European art. They especially spotlight Czech and Central European artists. Here, you can see the works of František Kupka and Otto Gutfreund, as well as other rotating exhibits.
This beautiful gallery also has an exciting location — you can find it on Kampa Island by the Vltava River. That’s right — it’s on an actual island. In the middle of mainland Europe!
If you’re looking for a unique setting with stunning views, this is the one for you.
MeetFactory is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. This contemporary gallery and artist residency was founded by David Černý, a famous Czech artist who also designed the famous Rotating Head of Franz Kafka.
MeetFactory is all about avant-garde exhibitions, live performances, and experimental installations. It’s perfect for edgier travelers who want to see something different.
If you’re interested in experiencing Prague’s alternative art scene, you really shouldn’t miss this one!
Schwarzenberg Palace is technically part of the National Gallery, but it definitely deserves its own spot on this list. It’s a beautiful place, which makes sense. After all, it’s actually a Baroque palace that was only later turned into an art gallery. Its highlights include Czech Baroque and Renaissance paintings and sculptures.
For its historical setting showcasing classic masterpieces, of course. Also, it’s near Prague Castle, another popular tourist destination — why not do a little 2-in-1?
Leica Art Gallery in Prague is a must-visit spot for photography lovers. It specializes in fine art photography by both Czech and international photographers. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, add this one to your itinerary. And don’t forget to check out the Leica camera store, too!
This one is a must for photography enthusiasts.
Last but not least, we have the Rudolfinum Gallery, which is a historic concert hall with a contemporary art gallery. It’s located by the Vltava River, near the Old Town, meaning that just walking there will take your breath away.
The Rudolfinum Gallery offers exhibitions of modern and contemporary art, despite how old and majestic it may look from the outside.
This gallery combines fine art with one of Prague’s most beautiful buildings. It also has a fun name. The Rudolfinum. Try not to think about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer while putting that name into Google Maps. I dare you.
The Rudolfinum is a gorgeous building, but it’s not the only one. Prague is a beautiful city with many views worth taking in. This is why river cruises are so popular here. If you want to see more of the city but don’t have a ton of time to walk everywhere, a cruise is the perfect solution.
You can try this Panoramic Vltava River Cruise by Get Your Guide, which will take you around Prague’s most famous landmarks, including Kampa Island, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and more.
Disclaimer: The above link is an affiliate link. If you choose to go on the cruise, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. No pressure, though!
In case it wasn’t obvious, Prague’s art scene is super diverse. Whether you’re a modern art enthusiast or a lover of the classics, you won’t be disappointed by checking out these gorgeous galleries. So, don’t forget to add them to your travel plans.
Which of these Prague art galleries will you visit first? Let me know in the comments!

My final destination in my post-graduation European trip was Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. There are many things to do in this city and I particularly like the variety in food, especially in meats. Duck, rabbit, deer, geese, and wild boar meat are quite common in restaurants throughout the city. From high-end restaurants to more casual dining places, Czech food offers a lot of variety. The Prague nightlife is also great, and I would sometimes have less time in the day to go sightseeing because I would return to my hotel late at night to catch up on sleep after an eventful evening.
One of the first places I visited in Prague was Prague Castle. The castle’s history dates back to 870, when it was first used as a church and a fort. The fort later became a medieval castle, and served as the residence of the Kings of Bohemia, the Holy Roman Emperors, the Presidents of Czechoslovakia, and currently it is the official office of the President of the Czech Republic.
Visiting Prague Castle was quite sentimental for me because I visited the castle when I was 15 and had fond memories of that visit. It was great to see it again and I had a sense of nostalgia walking around. Occasionally I would recognize something I remember from six years ago. Since the castle stands high upon a hill, I particularly enjoyed the great views of Prague while walking around the castle walls. Because of how large the castle…

This magical city of Prague! No other place can leave such a living memory. No other city looks at its visitors with such wonderful eyes. Prague is the city that can make you fall in love with it!
In this article, we are going to give you 5 most popular tourist tips for curious travelers. Slowly carrying out all the points and enjoying your trip, you will get the most complete impression of this wonderful city and its traditions.
Let’s start our unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague!
1. Walk along the Charles Bridge
Prague’s oldest bridge is built of sandstone blocks, flanked at each end by fortified towers (Lesser Town Bridge Towers, Old Town Bridge Tower). From 1683 to 1928, thirty statues of saints were carved to decorate the bridge, the most famous of which is the statue of St John of Nepomuk.
From the bridge, you will have amazing views over many Prague’s medieval towers, churches, and palaces. The view towards Lesser Town, dominated by the Prague Castle complex, is very picturesque.
The best time to visit Charles Bridge is early in the morning or at night when it is not crowded. You can climb two towers standing on both ends of the Bridge for a magnificent view of Prague and the bridge from above.
You can get to the Charles Bridge when taking the tram number 12, 20, 22 or 23, getting off at station Malostranse Namesti.
The Charles Bridge over the Vltava River is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Prague. Its towers and sculptures are worth to be seen!
2. Admire the architecture of Old Town Square and watch a unique Astronomical Clock performance
Wander through the Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí), where the true heart of Prague beats!
The elegant tower of the Old Town Hall with the world famous Astronomical Clock, the monumental Church of St. Nicholas and countless colorful houses of many styles give this place a unique atmosphere, which will mesmerize you if you decide to take a look at its charm.
Not avoiding a crowd of tourists, watch a performance on an Astronomical Clock at the Old Town Hall, called “The Apostle Parade”. Its main function was to depict the movement of the Sun and the Moon; showing the time was merely a secondary element. The Apostle figures became part of the clock in the middle of the 16th century.
Very much has been written about the performance itself, but nothing will convey that atmosphere of mystery and admiration that reigns over the square during this performance. For a greater impression during the presentation, be sure to remember that the clock was built in the 15th century and has not undergone any tangible changes since that time.
The Apostle parade can be seen on the Prague Astronomical Clock every hour on the hour from 9 a.m. till 11 p.m. However, it is better to watch it in the morning, when there are relatively few people on the square. To take the most advantageous place, come to the clock 15 minutes beforehand.
While walking along the historical center, try famous Czech trdelnik, a kind of spit cake, made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick and topped with sugar and walnuts. Here you can eat a fried sausage and drink Czech beer.
All this must be done by sitting on a free bench and enjoying the surrounding pictures. In winter, the beer can be replaced with hot mulled wine or grog.
3. Enjoy a classic performance in Prague National Theatre
The National Theatre in Prague belongs to the most important Czech cultural institutions with a rich artistic tradition. Today the National Theatre consists of three artistic ensembles — opera, ballet, and drama. Operas are sung mostly in Italian and are accompanied by both Czech and English subtitles.
Visit Giuseppe Verdi´s La Traviata and Aida, Camille Saint-Saens´ Samson and Dalila, or very popular Georges Bizet´s Carmen. If you want to see something by Czech authors, there is Bedrich Smetana´s Hubicka (The Kiss), Tajemstvi (The Secret), and famous Rusalka.
Another scene of the National Theater is the Estates Theater. On this stage, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart´s La Clemenza di Tito, Don Giovanni, La Nozze di Figaro, and The Magic Flute are staged.
If you prefer the Ballet, you can visit Adolphe Charles Adam´s Giselle or project Solo Pro tri (Solo for three).
Both of the buildings are very nice, performances are well prepared, done by the best Czech and world dancers and singers, prepared by great directors and choreographers. So if you like Opera or Ballet, it is worth to visit the National Theatre, as it can be a great cultural experience, and a way how to spend a pleasant evening in Prague.
Do you want to visit the smallest street in Prague and go inside these tiny houses?
4. Golden Lane or Zlatá ulička!
On the eastern side of the Prague Castle, not far from St. George’s Basilica, there is an unusual street called Zlatá ulička. It is considered a symbol of Prague, its historical heritage.
Colored facades of tiny houses emerge on the cobblestone pavement. Sixteen old buildings have survived here. Zlatá ulička itself is a kind of museum. In nine of them, there are mini-museums dedicated to the former inhabitants of the street. The rest are souvenir shops.
There is a legend that alchemists lived on this street, receiving elixirs of eternal youth, gold, and a philosopher’s stone for the Emperor.
In the house № 22 lived Franz Kafka; he worked here on the collection “The Village Doctor”. Now there is a bookshop in this building.
In the house № 14, marked with a sign depicting a cat, an owl, and a crystal ball, a fortune teller had her salon. Here is also a small house under № 27, once inhabited by a local healer. The house is filled with drugs and herbs, as befits a medieval pharmacy. A jeweler’s workshop can be viewed in the house № 15.
Try to find a house near the last lantern and ghosts of alchemists, prisoners of the White Tower and other former residents!
If you haven’t visited this magical street yet or missed it while being in Prague, I think now you are looking forward to making this destination your point number one.
Zlatá ulička is open every day 9:00–17:00. After 18:00 admission is free. But keep in mind that most souvenir shops are closed by this time.
How to get there? Go subway line A or tram 5, 12, 18, 20, 22 to the stop Malostranská.
5. Finally, climb the Petřín Hill and watch Prague from the Observation Tower
There are many parks and gardens in Prague, but we strongly recommend you to visit Petřín Hill as it offers a stunning view of the city’s red brick roofs.
Built as a mini version of Paris’s Eiffel Tower, the Petrin Observation Tower is 60m high. Climb 300 steps to reach the top of the tower, and the view over Prague is magnificent.
In the spring, hundreds of apples and cherries blossom there, filling the air with a heady aroma. Have a pleasant stroll around the rose garden.
Other attractions include an observatory, a museum, a telescope, a hall of mirrors, a church, and many nice cafes.
By the way, next to the Petřín Hill, there is the Kinský Garden (Zahrada Kinských). It is rather easy to go from one park to another, just find an arch in the wall that separates them. By the way, in the Kinský Garden, you can find the Transcarpathian ancient church.
Once you have enjoyed the views of Prague, we recommend you to have dinner in Nebozizek Restaurant near Petřín Hill. You can reach it on foot or by funicular.
To reach the Observation Tower at the top of Petřín Hill, take the Funicular Railway. It departs from Ujezd street in the Lesser Town (Malá Strana), near Ujezd tram stop.
I think now you must be ready for an amazing trip to Prague. We hope our recommendations for your unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague will be helpful and you will enjoy it!
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

My wife told me this yesterday:
“I was talking to an acquaintance, and she asked if I’d ever been to Prague? I said, ‘No, but my husband’s been twice and loved it.’ I haven’t been to Prague, right?”
“Well actually, you have. You and the girls and I went with my students on that trip from Berlin to Prague. We went to the Cathedral across the river (the Vlatava) and crossed the Charles bridge on the way back. Don’t you remember how cold it was that day? The wind was killing us and our guide took the most crowded route at the busiest time of the day. And one of my students was sick and gave me her cold, remember?”
“Oh, now it’s coming back to me.”
Don’t worry. My wife’s mind is full of tasks and Buddhist philosophy, and special guides to help her family and friends, not to mention all the people she serves as their trusted therapist and whatever issues they might have. She hasn’t fogotten all the trips she’s made in our lives, but because of this slip, she asked me and her sister to help her remember all the places she has been to. We’ve done so, and it’s truly an impressive list, even if I don’t want to remember, or want her to remember, that fated trip to Hawaii she took not long after our trip to Prague.

The night the avant-garde German theater group performed at the Roxy Klub in Prague between the sets I was DJing, I knew it would get weird.
When the troupe lit an explosive, and it went off in the center of the dance floor, it caused several chunks of the plaster ceiling to rain down on the heads of the audience. After my ears stopped ringing, I cued up a song and spun some Groove Collective. Dancers filled the dance floor, gyrating around the hole left in the old cement floor by the performance artists’ dynamite.
It was another Saturday night at the Roxy in 1995.
I moved to the Czech Republic in January and was enrolled as a student at Karlova Univerzita in the mass communications department. Rather than go to class, I’d hang out with my professor, Cyril, who discovered that I was a musician and that I loved literature. He introduced me to the gang at Yazzyk Magazine.
Yazzyk was a periodical specializing in publishing East European authors and poets translated into English. It was run by a Canadian named Douglas and a Mexican-American named Tony. They hired me to be in charge of…

Prague is a winter city. Summer is nice there but Prague doesn’t feel comfortable with summer. It’s in the winter where Prague is at its most self-expressed, when it shines, or rather glows. Anyone who has walked in winter on the lonely cobblestone streets under the lamp posts emitting ochre light knows how Kafka got his inspiration.

Some cool historical stuff to know about Prague before you go
Defiant. Resilient. Betrayed. Those are the words that come to mind as I walk through the streets of Prague for the first time and learn about this historic city on the Vltava River.
It is hard not to experience Prague and feel the weight of history that bears down of the city and the Czech people, who over the course of the last nearly 700 years, have been ruled for a majority of that time by other states, nations and empires.
Prague got off to a really strong start in the 14th Century under King Charles IV, who strengthened the economy, started the first university in Central Europe and expanded the Prague Castle, including starting construction of St. Vitus Cathedral. He also commissioned the famous bridge across the Vltava, which was started on July 9, 1357, at 5:31 a.m. when he laid the first stone. This is well known because the date and time create a numerical palindrome (1–3–5–7–9–7–5–3–1), which meant something to Medieval numerologists, who must have been on to something because the original bridge is still standing strong, 668 years later.
Despite its promising start as the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Prague fell into the hands the Hapsburgs, when Ferdinand I was elected by the Bohemian nobility as king after their ruler, King…

A beautiful and unique city known for everything ranging from its rich history to its active nightlife, Prague is a gem in the heart of the Czech Republic that cannot be missed.
Located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, Prague has a beauty that can only be understood by traveling to the city itself. Before starting my trip to Europe, I asked the advice of several other travelers about which destinations they recommend that I travel to. High on the list of many of these travelers was Prague. With so many recommendations, I simply had to visit. But what makes this city such a favorite among both travelers and its inhabitants?
To start with, I found the people of the Czech Republic to be very kind to their visitors; they wanted to share the country that they love so much with anyone who is willing to take the time to visit.
As far as activities go, exploring Prague without a map was one of my favorite experiences in the city. The day I arrived, I decided to wander around in search of food. In the process, I was able to get a glimpse of some of the famous architecture around the city, as well as some of its most iconic sights. After returning to my hostel, I was able to do some research into the history of these locations while also planning out the places I wanted to spend more time with.
As far as specific attractions go, Prague is a perfect city to visit no matter your time frame. With that being said, a few of the most prominent and worthwhile attractions include the Charles Bridge, all of Old Town, Wenceslas Square, Petrin Hills, and Prague Castle. The main sights can be seen in a tour around the city in a day (which requires a ton of walking), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any more time there.
Now let’s pretend you have just arrived in Prague and you are eager to see everything you can in just one walking journey. Doing this, I would suggest starting in Wenceslas Square and walking down the slope towards Old Town. A walk through Old Town takes you through the picturesque streets of Prague, while also allowing you to visit the Astronomical Tower, the Old Town Square, and St. Nicolas’ Church; all of which are well worth it if you find yourself in Prague. After seeing these iconic sights, wandering towards the Jewish Quarter of the city provides an opportunity to learn some of the history of the city through the years. From there, walk towards the river to see the concert hall known as Rudolfinum while listening to music written by Czech composers that you might not recognize by name, but you will recognize by their music. Walk along the Vltava River towards the Charles Bridge where you should take your time to take in the atmosphere and the unique architecture of the bridge as well as the views of Old Town and Prague Castle as they face off across the river. This walk brings you to the other side of the river where you can see the somewhat surprising Lennon Wall as well as taking a trip to Prague Castle.
This walking trip provides an opportunity to see most major sights in Prague. Like with any city, it is possible to go into more detail if you so desire, and Prague is a city that deserves that extra attention.
There are museums and historical sites littered throughout the city, and they are not hard to find. I visited the National Technical Museum in a quieter part of the city and I was blown away by the size and level of detail that the museum provided. Anyone with enough interest could spend a full day exploring every detail. In addition to that, the Jewish museum in the Jewish Quarter is well known and has the reputation of being very good, but I did not have the time to visit it, unfortunately. The Prague Castle allows for entry that is free of charge, but a ticket is required to visit some parts of the complex. Purchase of this ticket depends on the level of detail you wish to go into, and the amount of time you have to spend there.
The activity that I highly recommend is taking a trip to the Petrin Hills where you can buy a ticket to ascend Petrin Tower where the views of the city are simply breathtaking.
These examples stand as just a few options for ideas on how to make your trip to Prague as complete as you can want. After taking a walk around the city to see all of the sights, taking the public transportation provides for a welcome rest from all of the walking. The transportation is cheap and cost is based on time which makes it perfect for travelers who want unlimited travel for just a few days. As far as additional public transportation goes, taxis can be found throughout the city, but be sure to find a good price. In many instances, getting an Uber will be far more convenient and allow for the best possible price.
The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and its capital city is the culmination of the country’s beauty. Prague is a city that should be on every traveler’s list for its uniqueness, its culture, and its people.

Cafe Louvre — The doors of the Café Louvre first opened in 1902. The restaurant still preserves the old café traditions. So even today you can still enjoy the unique atmosphere of a historical, grand café, as Franz Kafka, Albert Einstein or T. G. Masaryk knew it.
Everything on the menu is wonderful, and the outdoor seating is a magnificent welcome to Prague.
Walk across Charles Bridge over the Vltava River to find yourself in Malá Strana or the Lesser Town
But before you cross the bridge stop at GOOD FOOD, the holy grail of Trdelniks.
Climb up the Charles Bridge Lookout Tower for a view of both sides of the river before you walk to the other side.
Do the “hike” up to the Prague Castle. We skipped out on the tour, but the view from the very top is nothing short of incredible — great if you enjoy history and architecture!
Check out the Golden Lane, a narrow and scenic alleyway that used to house goldsmiths’ workshops. Painting a picture of the past, you see how people used to work and live as you enter the recreated workshops. Franz Kafka, the…

In the heart of Prague, a city steeped in the history of the Czech Republic and adorned with ancient architecture, my lens embarked on a journey through the juxtaposition of tradition and modernity. Arriving on a cold, foggy night, Tochukwu couldn’t help but worry about the weather’s impact on his photo walk. However, as dawn broke and the city emerged from the mist, he felt a surge of anticipation.
The grand doors of historic buildings greeted me, their intricate designs creating a breathtaking backdrop for my subjects. As Tochukwu roamed the streets, he encountered a young woman, her weary steps echoing against the ancient stones. Entering through the colossal doors, she became a silent storyteller, a fusion of fatigue and the timeless beauty of Prague. The echo was clear for many others that he saw passing the ancient streets of Prague, as the walls laid a perfect canvas for my imagination.
But the city was not frozen in time. Construction workers toiled, transforming the ancient into the modern. Amid the scaffolding, a mapping car glided through the streets, documenting the metamorphosis. The synergy of human effort and technological advancement was a captivating dance, a visual representation of Prague’s evolution.
As Tochukwu framed scenes of change, he couldn’t ignore the emergence of local delivery startups like Wolt, challenging the global dominance of giants like Uber Eats and Bolt. It seemed as though the city had its rhythm, a beat that the local players danced to, dominating the delivery scene while the international names loomed in the background.
Yet, amidst the transformations, Prague held steadfast to its traditions. A local Christmas market, set up by merchants near the city centre, breathed life into the streets. The aromas of festive delights mingled with the sounds of cheerful chatter, creating a timeless haven amid the bustling changes.
Prague also embraced alternative transport, with cyclists weaving through the cobbled streets. Although the city lacked dedicated lanes, it provided ample parking spaces for bicycles, promoting a green and sustainable mode of commuting. Each photograph of a bicycle parking space or a cyclist captured a moment and a testament to the city’s commitment to eco-friendly living.
Amidst it all, an old woman, framed against the grand doors, puffed on her cigarette. It is a seemingly mundane act, yet poignant against the backdrop of ancient structures. It spoke of continuity, a personal ritual unfazed by the changing tides of time.
And then there were the old trams—practical, reliable, and seemingly timeless. Moving people 24/7, these trams became the city's veins, circulating life through its historic arteries.
In one poignant frame, Tochukwu captured the essence of a young woman navigating the intricate tapestry of life in Prague. Her journey homeward was a visual symphony — headphones in place, encapsulating a world of personal melodies or knowledge development, and in her grasp, a pack of tissues, an unspoken emblem of responsibilities both personal and professional. The photograph silently whispered of the delicate balance she maintained, seamlessly weaving the threads of her personal aspirations with the demands of her professional endeavours.
Prague revealed its story in every photograph—one of contrasts, resilience, and the harmonious coexistence of the old and the new. As the shutter clicked, each frame became a chapter, a testament to the city’s dynamic spirit and the ever-unfolding narrative of its streets.

As a Master’s student living in Munich for almost a year, I hadn’t ventured outside of Germany much, except for a brief visit to Maastricht. After finishing my exams two weeks ago, my friends and I decided to take a weekend trip to Prague. Being students, we couldn’t afford a longer trip without stretching our finances, and we all had commitments the following week. So, we planned a straightforward two-day trip, determined to make the most of our limited time.
Our plan was simple: catch a Flixbus from Munich to Prague at 7 a.m. on Saturday, arriving at noon, and return by 8 p.m. on Sunday. We booked a hostel near the city center so we could explore Prague on foot without worrying about public transportation. It seemed foolproof — what could go wrong?
Well, things didn’t go quite as planned. We all made it to the bus on time, only to discover that the seats we had booked together in row 20 didn’t exist. The bus wasn’t configured as expected, and when we asked the Flixbus employee, he simply shrugged, saying there wasn’t much they could do. So, we reluctantly sat in random seats, separated from each other.
The journey was supposed to be straightforward, but when we made a stop in Regensburg, things took a turn. The bus, already nearly full when we left Munich, was supposed to be a two-story vehicle, but instead, it was a single-story bus. At Regensburg, there were many passengers waiting to board, but not enough seats. It quickly became clear that there had been a mix-up. The employees informed the waiting passengers that they’d have to wait for the next bus, which would arrive in two hours. This didn’t sit well with two elderly Ukrainian women who boarded the bus and refused to get off until the next bus arrived. As a result, we were all forced to wait for two hours.
Frustrated by the delay, we decided to grab some coffee to stay awake, as we were all pretty tired from the early start. While waiting outside the bus, a young Canadian couple approached us, asking for directions to the bakery where we had bought our coffee. The guy went to get their drinks, while the girl stayed and joined our conversation. We learned that they were from Quebec and had been exploring Europe for a week, also heading to Prague. When the guy returned, we chatted for about an hour, discussing everything from European culture to the situation with the two Ukrainian women holding up our trip.
About 20 minutes before the other bus was due to arrive, a shy teenage girl slowly joined our conversation. We found out she was from Prague and had been taking a German course in Regensburg. Her local knowledge came in handy, and we asked her for recommendations on what to see and do in Prague.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the second bus arrived, and the extra passengers boarded. We resumed our journey, but by the time we reached Prague, I was in desperate need of a bathroom. After handling that situation, we checked in at our hostel, which was conveniently located near the city center. The hostel was basic, a small room on the 5th floor with four beds and no windows, but thankfully it had air conditioning, as the weather was quite warm.
We took quick showers and headed out to explore the city. By then, it was already 3 p.m., so we started with a checking out the exterior of the National Czech Museum, right next to our hostel. Prague’s architecture immediately captivated us — vibrant colors, tiled streets, and historic buildings at every turn.
Feeling hungry, we went to a Czech restaurant recommended by the girl we met on the bus and tried traditional dishes like Svíčková and Czech goulash, accompanied by the famous Czech beer. Fun fact: the Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world, which was surprising to learn, given that I live in Bavaria.
After our meal, we made our way to the Old Town Square, passing the quirky Dancing House and numerous tourists along the way. We couldn’t resist trying Trdelník, a sweet treat made of a cinnamon roll-like cone filled with ice cream and fruits. Delicious as it was, it attracted a lot of bees — something to keep in mind if you ever try it!
At the Old Town Hall, we met up with the Canadian couple again to see the Prague Astronomical Clock. Afterward, we walked through the city, crossing the beautiful Charles Bridge over the Vltava River, surrounded by stunning views and people enjoying boat rides. We decided to save the boat ride for the next day and continued towards Prague Castle. The hike up to the castle was challenging, but the view was worth it. Although the ticket booth for the castle interior was closed, we explored the castle grounds and admired the colorful, doll-like houses on Golden Lane.
By this point, we had walked nearly 15 kilometers and were ready for dinner. After trying several places that were either full or had closed kitchens, we found a laid-back burger place where we ate and drank until 11 p.m. Exhausted, we finally called it a day and returned to our hostel.
The next day, we started with breakfast at a local café, then headed to the Czech National Museum. This museum was incredible, with rooms dedicated to everything from minerals and history to World War II and various species of animals. We spent four hours there, completely absorbed in the exhibits.
After the museum, we met up with the Canadian couple again for a planned boat ride on the Vltava River. However, the boat operator warned us of an impending storm, which we didn’t believe at first because the weather seemed fine. Fast forward a little, and we were running through the rain to the nearest restaurant. The storm dashed our hopes for the boat ride, but we found a fantastic Italian restaurant where we spent the next two hours waiting for the rain to subside, enjoying great pizza, beer, and conversation.
As the rain eased, we reluctantly made our way back to the bus station, still a bit wet and tired. Despite a half-hour delay, the return bus ride was uneventful, and we finally arrived in Munich at 3 a.m., facing long routes home via public transport.
Despite the challenges and setbacks, the trip to Prague was incredibly satisfying. The city left a lasting impression, and I’m already eager to return to explore more — like the Jewish Cemetery, beer bath, Sex Machine Museum, Beer Museum, Ice Bar, Torture Museum, and many more fascinating places.
I’m writing this recollection of my trip to Prague in order to preserve the beautiful memories I had. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Ah Prague,
Forget Paris being the city of love. Prague, in my opinion, takes the prize! It’s one of the most well-preserved and beautiful cities in the world. I’ve had the pleasure of visiting several times and I never seem to get bored! There is always something new to discover or somewhere new to explore. Despite the cobblestones causing me to stumble every few steps or almost being hit by a tram, I have fallen in love with this charming medieval city.
Since my first trip there at sixteen, which was a bazillion years ago, I have been back 5 times. And no matter how many times I visit, I never seem to shake off the feeling that I am walking through a fairytale. I still haven’t found prince charming, but the hunt isn’t over!
Everything from the historical bridges to the hidden cobblestoned alleyways to the vibrant buildings, Prague really is a place that should be on everyone’s bucket list.
To inspire your inner wanderlust, and hopefully get you to start planning your trip to Prague, these are the things that made me fall in love with the city. If this list doesn’t convince you, I don’t know what will!
Walking through Prague feels like visiting a neverending history museum. It’s one of the very few European cities not destroyed by the World War II bombings, so most of the architectural beauty is original and more than eight centuries old. Each building has a distinct style and color, and to me, that is one of the things that makes this city so special. I love walking around and imagining who lived in them right after they were built or what they were used for.
A few of my favorite architectural gems are Charles Bridge, National Theater, and Municipal House. Prague is best explored by ditching the map and just getting lost. You never know what you might find.
Prague has a reputation for being one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and there is no better way to experience that beauty than from an elevated vantage point. There are so many places to get spectacular views, you really can’t go wrong. My personal favorite is the Letna Park Beer Garden. On a warm day, it’s the perfect spot to grab a cold beer and gaze out at the picturesque city below or better yet, watch the sunset. There is no better way to end your day.
One of my favorite aspects of Prague is the vibrancy. It’s a city with so much going on day in and day out and can be overwhelming to pick and choose where to go and what to do, but being in a city with too much choice has never been a bad thing in my book. Let’s just hope indecisiveness isn’t your weakness because then you might have a problem.
Prague’s mystery is one I have yet to crack, and I hope to keep it that way. With a history dating back over 2000 years and the fact that all the buildings are original and intact, makes it one of the most interesting, spellbinding and mysterious cities in Europe. I always seem to discover a new part of the city every time I visit.
These days, finding cheap destinations in Europe has become more difficult. Unfortunately, Prague isn’t as cheap as some of it’s Eastern European neighbors, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not one of the more affordable places to visit. You can easily find budget-friendly activities and restaurants scattered all over the city.
One of my favorite resources for finding budget-friendly things to do is Like a Local. Locals will give you tips on restaurants, attractions, shopping and nightlife and a lot of times they will recommend places that tourists don’t normally know about. You can save quite a bit of money if you are willing to venture out of the city center.
Smazeny Syr is a delicious traditional Czech food you can’t leave Prague without trying. This fried cheese dish is found pretty much everywhere from the simplest food cart to the classiest restaurant. Fast food places will usually serve it as a sandwich, which makes for a pretty amazing snack after a night out, but most commonly it is served on its own with a side salad or potatoes. Don’t order it on your first day because you might not want to try anything else.
Is there anything like watching a sunset after a busy day of sightseeing? I personally think it’s the best way to finish off a day. Ohhh, that rhymes! Prague has several vantage points where you can witness mother natures phenomenon. Many of the places will have cafes where you can grab a drink, find a seat as you watch the sun slowly sinking below the horizon.
A few of my favorite spots to watch the sunset are, Letna Park, Stefanikuv Most (a bridge with less foot traffic than Charles Bridge), Vyšehrad, and Prague Castle. Although watching the sunset with Prague Castle in the background is pretty incredible.

The Charles bridge is one of the busiest spots in Prague because of its beautiful gothic structure and central location. If you wanna avoid the crowds, head over later in the day as it gets dark. But if you’re looking for a souvenir or a performance make sure you get there before 4 to see the street performers work their magic or buy a painted picture of the city’s scenery. For the best views on the Charles Bridge, take in a sunset view or climb the tower at the foot of the bridge for just 100 Czech crowns (around 5 U.S. dollars) for some beautiful views at the top.
The Prague castle is one of the most visited spots in Prague and it boasts incredible architecture at the top of a hill offering spectacular views. Head there on a weekday for less crowds. If you’re traveling on a budget you can get inside the back area for free, or pay a small fee to get closer up to the front and see the whole thing. To avoid walking up the big hill, take the tram up the hill and walk back down for the beautiful views.
This monastery has been named the most beautiful library in the world. Go just two tram stops beyond the Prague Castle for a chance to see the beautiful painted ceilings. The monastery does have a charge to go inside, as well as a small fee to be able to take pictures of the inside. Also note that you cannot go fully inside the rooms but can get a view beyond a roped off area.
The dancing house is a marvel of Czech modern cubist architecture along the Vlatva river. Take a tour of the museum and gallery or ride the elevator to the top floor for a restaurant and outdoor deck. Just order a drink or some food and get access to the outdoor viewing area with a 360 view. Fun fact: you can see 9 different bridges in the distance from the top of Dancing House!
For one of the most iconic Prague sights, head to Old Town Square and the astronomical clock tower. A huge crowd gathers as the time reaches the hour and people wait for the clock to change. Get there 15–20 minutes early for the best views. The clock also has an inside museum that gives you its history and lets you see the other side of the characters that pop out of the clock.
Wenceslas Square has been called the Times Square of Prague. It’s just a short walk from Old Town and named after the Czech Saint Wenceslas. It has a combo of shops and restaurants, with several traditional Czech restaurants as well as street food. Right in the heart of Wenceslas Square is also a bustling nightlife with a variety of clubs and bars that stay open late and attract large crowds. You can also hope to catch an outdoor food festival, held seasonally and offering street food like sausages and hot wine and beer.

A few days before Christmas, I received the Winter Holidays Edition of the Prague for Expats Newsletter. It began by saying:
“we hope you are enjoying snowy Prague, as it really is the best time for long walks through the city and its surroundings”
I was a little taken aback by this, and my initial reaction was to question whether the author had ever visited Prague in the snow. Actually, TBH, that was my second reaction. My first wasn’t suitable for a family-oriented blog! Like many cities, Prague, in the snow, is far from being a good place for long walks. It’s not even a good place for short walks, especially in the city centre or “historic Prague” as it’s called in the guidebooks. For several days that week before Christmas, I felt more locked down than during the official lockdowns during the pandemic. During the pandemic, we were just discouraged from going out, but the snow is a different matter, and like many locals, I dread snowfall in the deep midwinter. The cold I can handle, which is good because it can get mighty chilly! But, not the snow…
Sure, from the comfort of a room with a view, Prague is absolutely stunning under a shroud of pristine white snow. The hills surrounding the city take on a bleakness in the pale grey light, but the scenery becomes stunning when the skies turn blue. Be forewarned. Once you step outside, walking around Prague becomes a nightmare. In her 2011 song, “50 Words for Snow”, Kate Bush got really close to the mark with “anklebreaker”.
The problem is Prague's pavements combined with the huge footfall of thousands of tourists. It takes very little time for the white snow to turn into an ashy dirty wet sludge which on Prague’s mosaic pavements becomes a skating rink even before the wet sludge starts to refreeze. When it’s cold enough (as it was last week), the sludge quickly turns into invisible sheets of ice which are treacherous to both body and ego. Let’s face it; no one likes to look like a clown when they’re walking down a street full of people; it’s embarrassing enough when you can’t be seen!
But the problems don’t just come from under your feet. You’re constantly at risk of an attack from above as snow begins to melt on the rooftops, there’s a threat of baby avalanches, icicles spearing you and huge dollops of icy meltwater, which almost always seem to land on your glasses (or bald patches).
Prague city authorities are quick to get the gritting wagons and carts out, but this compounds the problem. Even after ten days, some of the more heavily gritted pavements are still covered in pin-sharp little stones which get stuck in the soles of your shoes and need to be picked out with that penknife attachment you never use for getting stones out of horse's shoes!
I have yet to find a single pair of shoes that can deal with Prague pavements regardless of the weather. Some are great in the summer; some work well in the rain, but none work well in any snow conditions — not even proper mountain boots! I had a pair of ECCO Gore-tex shoes which were the best all-rounders, but sadly, these have been decimated by five years of constant usage walking around the city.
So, don’t be fooled by the tour guides, the glossy guidebooks and the slick videos showcasing our beautiful city under a fresh fall of snow. Call up an Uber to take you to Petrin Hill, up to Prague Castle, or over to Vitkov Hill, walk a few hundred yards, and marvel at the panoramas. Then get back in your taxi and get comfy in the hotel bar until the thaw has completed.
Unless, of course, you really want to put the Czech health system to the test or find out how good your insurance is!

The first light of dawn slips through the curtains of our hotel room. I glance over at my girlfriend, already awake, her eyes tracing the soft glow filtering in. Neither of us know why we’re up so early. It’s not jet lag or the faint hum of the city outside. So maybe, it’s the anticipation of wanting to see a side of Prague that most visitors miss.
We step outside into the cool morning air. The cobblestones feel damp beneath our feet. Street lamps cast soft halos in the mist, and somewhere in the distance, a bird begins to sing. The city feels quiet, almost like it’s waiting for something to happen.
We turn the corner together and spot the Old Town Hall. Its underground played a pivotal role in the Prague Uprising against Nazism. Attached to it is the Astronomical Clock, a medieval wonder that shows the positions of the Sun, Moon, Earth, and Zodiac constellations.
Humanity has tried to measure time for millennia. From the Maya in Mesoamerica to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in the UK…

My Guide in the Czech Republic (main part Prague)
In this article, I am going to answer the FAQ about Prague and give you some tips about the city.
I have been living in the city for 4 years and whenever I go for a walk in the old town, I feel like it is my first time visiting the city. That’s why I decided to work as a tour guide for a while. I don’t do it anymore, except private tours from time to time.
So, let Is go through the things that you want to know before coming to the Magical City.
*I will recommend videos to watch or website(s) to visit in each section, some of the videos may don’t have accurate information such as exchange rate but the information is useful no matter when you come to Prague ;)
The Czech Republic is not in the eurozone, the official currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech crown (Kč/ in English CZK). 1 euro is around 25CZK. You will find a link to the Czech National Bank and to a website with the best exchange point in Prague in the end of this section.
Coins: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 CZK * All the coins are useful (not the case with euros — 1cent, 2cent, 5cent) Banknotes: 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 CZK
*You should avoid the 2000 and 5000 banknotes for small purchases.
Although CZK is the official currency in the Czech Republic, you still can pay by Euro almost everywhere specially in Prague. However, you will not get the best exchange rate except in the international chains (supermarkets, coffee chains, fast-food chains, …).

Public transport is efficient in Prague in a way that you don’t need a rental car or taxis. Actually, it is cheaper and faster xD. There are 3 lines of Metro, 10s of tramways, and 100s of buses.
The tickets for a single trip are for 30 minutes (for 24czk) or 90 minutes (for 32czk). The daily ticket (24h) is for 110czk and if you are here for 3 days (72h) your ticket costs 310czk.
*If you are willing to stay more than 5 days, I recommend buying a monthly ticket for 570czk
For more details check these videos:
How to buy a ticket (Honest Guide)
Travelling around the city (Honest Guide)
Prague Public Transport at Night (Honest Guide)
How to get from Prague’s airport to the city center (Honest Guide)
GOING TO PRAGUE BY TRAIN OR BUS (Honest Guide)
To find transport connection, check out this website (they have also mobile app) www.idos.cz
To rent bikes use Rekola, but you will need a credit card to use the app.
You can use Uber and yeah it is possible to pay by cash or taxi companies like Tick Tack, Nejlevnější Taxi or MODRÝ ANDĚL (if you went out with your car and end up drinking beers with your friends, they can give you a ride for you and your car xD at night).
*Ride for the airport to the city center should cost you around 500czk (20 euro), be careful from scams.
You have many options such as Hotels, Hostels, Airbnb, apartments, etc. I am going to describe the different areas by character so that it helps you choosing the right place.
Old town : you won’t need transportation since everything is close to you. However, a lot of going on around and there is a big possibility that you won’t have a calm night.
Lesser town (malá strana) : It is near the castle, Charles Bridge and many beautiful parks. You will need transportation and there are almost no supermarkets nearby (most of the prices are for tourists).
New Town : A great neighborhood, restaurants and cafés are excellent in the area. Most of your neighbors are tourists, those who hurry up are called the locals. You will need transportation and fortunately there are two metro stations in the area and many tramways pass by that zone.
The rest of the areas are cheaper, calmer (exception: Žižkov) and most of the residents are locals, so you won’t be scammed.
During my work as a tour guide, I met tens of people who planned their stay in Prague just one day or two days and double of that period in Budapest (sometimes more time for Bratislava than Prague :D). I think you know what I am going to say by now. Minimum days to spend in Prague should be 3 or 4 days. If you want to enjoy the city and yourself, one week to 10 days.
Plan A — 3 days:
You should not enter every monument/museum in your way. Consider taking transportation so that you won’t be tired by the end of the day.
Plan B — royal stay:
Life is good, you have enough time to visit the main monuments, party, enjoy the traditional Czech cuisine and save energy for the next city/country.
Plan Z — Underestimated city / just 1 night or even less
You can start by Prague Castle (don’t spend more than 60 -90 minutes in that area)than follow the Royal way (Coronation route). Next stop will be Charles Bridge that will lead you to the old Town Square. You should be tired by now from walking, so reward yourself by a hot coffee in Skautský Institut or another place (avoid the coffees in the square if you don’t want to be scammed) .
You should have enough time to enjoy a traditional dish. Later on, go to Wenceslas Square.
*This can be done the other way around (from Wenceslas Square to the Castle, but I recommend the first direction because Prague Castle in on the top of the Hill).
COOLEST DISTRICT in PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
1000czk without accommodation is fair enough. I will tell you why :
Transport: 110czk for 24h
Food: 600czk (150–200 per meal)
Coffee&cake: 150czk (coffee for 50czk, cake for 100czk)
The rest can be used for entrance to museum (sometimes it will cost you 250 czk, but generally around 150czk or less)
The list is so long, you should make your priorities. If you like museums, Prague offers museum for any kind of thing (Torture, toys, chocolate, Lego, Apple Inc.,). You love outdoors?.. well Prague offers that too, but if you can’t stand cold weather, you should visit the City during Spring or Summer Season.
The must visit list that I recommend is the following:
Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, Old Town Square, Prague Zoo, Wenceslas square, National museum, etc.
However, those are the typical ones, there are other monuments and places to visit. Check out the following videos:

The traditional Czech cuisine is so authentic. The food is heavy, tasty and not healthy :D Main ingredients are meat (mainly pork), potatoes, cabbage and flour. So, don’t expect salads or vegetarian food.
The best thing that you will enjoy, in the Czech Republic, are snacks and cakes.
I recommend reading this article:
https://www.tasteofprague.com/pragueblog/traditional-czech-food-in-prague-what-to-have-and-where-to-have-it
Here is also a playlist of videos from Honest Guide that I recommend to watch (included vegetarian restaurants):
Restaurants in Prague (Honest Guide)
Safety:
The City is safe and secure, but be careful in the crowded areas. There are no ghettos or not recommended areas. The Czech Republic is one of the safest countries in the world 😊.
Halal food:
There are some restaurants that offer halal food. Most of them are near to the city center. Here is a list of the restaurants, I will try to cover all the areas in Prague:
Mangal Restaurant is located in the Wenceslas square. Address: Václavské náměstí 64, Praha
Barakat is near the mosque of the center. Address: Opletalova 28, Praha
Istanbul Kebab is also near the mosque of the center, less than 100 meters from Barakat. Address: Politických vězňů, 17, Praha
Jordan Restaurant in the lesser town (mala strana). So, if you are hungry and you still near the castle this should be your destination. Address: Malostranské náměstí 36/22, Praha
Safír is a good Lebanese restaurant. You can find it in different malls (OC Nový Smíchov, Arkády Pankrác, OC DBK — Budějovická , OC Chodov) * OC stands for Commercial Center. Here is their website http://www.isafir.cz , but it is not updated.
*if you are so into halal things, you should go 100% vegan in this country or buy expensive food from bio supermarkets/restaurants.
Different products use pork gelatin or other extracted products from pork. These products can be yogurt, sweet bakery (even croissant), etc.
If you want to have bolognaise or burger with mashed beef meat, make sure that is not mixed with pork (in non halal places).
Mosques:
Mosque of the center: Opletalova 930/28, 110 00 Praha 1 (be advised, it is located inside a building)
Mosque Alfirdaus : Na Košince 502/1, 180 00 Praha 8-Libeň
Mosque of Černý Most: Blatská 1491, 198 00 Praha 9
Other tips:
Keep in mind that the Czech Republic is in the CENTER of Europe and not in the East. Also avoid saying Czechia, no one like it.

Prague is pretty, I’ll give you that. I have some fond memories from my first visit in 2011. I swear it wasn’t such a tourist hotspot 13 years ago but maybe it was and I was so enchanted by its architecture I didn’t notice the crowds.
Our group was royally ripped off by taxis as soon as we arrived at the station. We didn’t have time to do the currency conversions. We had booked an apartment close to the station, not realising Prague, like many other European cities, had more than one train station and our accommodation happened to be close to the other station.
medium.com
The more you travel, the more you learn. That first experience left a bad taste in our mouths. The taxi fares had used all of our allotted spending money for Prague so we had to cut back. No dining out for us so we ordered a pizza and calzone takeaway. It turned out the taxi debacle was a commonplace occurrence in Prague as in other cities. But we were inexperienced travellers and always booked accommodation within walking distance of the station. Except in Prague.

Prague is a beautiful city. The river flows through the heart of it with the Disney-looking castle perched atop a hillside in the background. Its baroque and romanesque architecture give it an air of elegance that is incredibly unique.
The Old Town Square is the main area boasting beautiful buildings and the famous Orloj, an astronomical clock that sings at the top of every hour. It was teeming with tourists, so we didn’t stay too long in that area. And, unfortunately similar to Amsterdam, many of the streets were overflowing with trash and graffitied walls, which degraded the beauty of the city. In addition, overwhelming crowds and poor weather influenced our perception of Prague. It was obscenely hot the first few days, which gave us limited time to prance about before the sun scorched down on us and we had to take refuge inside shady cafes. But, the last few days cooled off and it even started raining out of the blue so we had to take cover again.
Despite an abundance of tourists and hot weather, we found that the best way to enjoy ourselves was by venturing out of the main town squares and finding solace along the side streets. Wandering along Old Town’s cobblestone streets was a great way to spend our time because we felt like this was more of an ideal way to experience this archetypal European city. I also had a chance to discover a specialty of Czech desserts: the trdelník chimney. It’s a funnel-cake filled with soft-serve ice cream and smells like a cinnamon roll. You can often find bakers on the streets baking the dough on a rotating spit then rolling it in cinnamon and sugar before filling it up with soft-serve. It was delicious confection for any sweet-tooth to enjoy!
In Vrtba garden, I got to see a photoshoot with a fashion model walking throughout the grounds. And I followed in her footsteps popping some poses myself.
We also got a great view walking up the steps of the Italian-style gardens and seeing the city beyond them. But, the best sights (and sounds) were yet to come…
The walk to Prague Castle was one of our favorite parts of the city. First, we started the walk from the Powder Tower, then up and over Charles Bridge. Charles Bridge is an attraction all by itself. Built in the 14th century, it’s lined with: sculptures of religious images and prolific Czech figures, street performers, artists and peddlers. It provides some of the most scenic views of the city over the Vltava River.
After crossing the bridge, we wound through cobblestone lanes and then climbed 200+ steps up to the castle entrance. Though the hike up to the castle is a bit of a workout, it’s worth it to get a spectacular view of Prague. In particular, the view at the top from the Starbucks (yep, you read that correctly; they pick the best locations!) situated in an outdoor patio setting overlooking the city was incomparable.
Once we arrived at Prague Castle, there’s no shortage of things to do. The compound includes a pretty expansive collection of eclectic buildings with museums, cafes, and archways connected by the internal castle roads. It’s a self-sufficient city unto itself similar to Windsor Castle. And, after the trek uphill we found a nice little offshoot area next to a cafe where we could sit, listen to a fountain, and cool off.
One of the best things we did was attend an organ concert in St. Vitus Cathedral, in the heart of the castle complex. St. Vitus is a 14th century Gothic church housing the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors. It’s also the home to a great organ that’s about 3 stories tall! We got to hear the prodigious instrument in all of its glory at a special evening concert. The booming sound of the pipes reverberated through the gothic arches making the church come alive! I can only imagine how awesome it must have been to the Bohemians back in the day when this baby was first installed. The event was unbelievably special, and I savored the moment listening to the sweet tempo and the rich tones of the organ. It has inspired me to start tickling the ivories once again!

I’ve lived in Prague for 25 years, and I get asked pretty frequently about good things to do, so I figured I’d put it into a list.
In terms of events calendars, I’d check the Expats.cz (www.expats.cz) calendar, the Prague TV (www.prague.tv) calendar, and the Czech Tourism site (which is good, but kinda basic — http://www.czechtourism.com/home/).
Here’s something you might not know: Vietnamese culture is strong in Prague. Vietnamese are the third-largest ethnic minority in the Czech Republic (behind Slovaks and Ukrainians), and there are a number of places to get great Vietnamese food, including the sprawling SAPA marketplace (Anthony Bourdain visited there when he came to Prague a couple of years ago). SAPA is like a huge swap meet. It’s kind of hard to get to, but a really unexpected thing to find in Prague. (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/wKypyCh5AW32)
Barring that, I’d recommend visiting Banh Mi Makers on Dlouhá třida in the Old Town for a great Banh Mi sandwich. In fact, the building that houses Banh Mi Makers is a gourmet shopping center that also hosts one of the must-visit restaurants in town, the stand-up Naše Maso butcher shop Map: https://goo.gl/maps/XacKM4neyct. If you have enough lead time, I highly recommend reserving their ‘Noc s řezníkem (Night With A Butcher)’ an absolutely massive six-course
Just down Dlouhá, you have Lokal, which is a retro-style pub that serves some of the freshest Pilsner Urquell outside of Pilsen. And next door you have the Roxy and NoD spaces, which are great for catching a DJ gig or maybe a performance (check the website at www.roxy.cz).
In terms of vegetarian fare, I like the Maitrea restaurant near the Old Town Square, and Radost FX Cafe, and I highly recommend the Eska restaurant in the up and coming Karlin neighborhood. It just got a Michelin Bib Gourmand, and while it isn’t a strictly vegan restaurant, it’s a place that focuses on bread and things made with yeast or fermentation. It’s excellent.
One place that’s kinda touristy but still excellent is the rooftop bar at the Hotel U Prince, just off the Old Town Square. Walk into the hotel, all the way to the back, and you’ll find a glass elevator. Take that to the top and walk up some stairs, and you’ll be rewarded with one of the most spectacular views of the city you could ever imagine. And it’s even heated in the winter. https://www.terasauprince.com/terrace
The Maurer Grand Restaurant list (and app) has a ton of great restaurant recommendations too. http://www.grandrestaurant.cz/home/?lng=en
Prague has some great design shops if you know where to look. I especially like Tuzeks (http://tuzeks.eu/), which is a play on words on the old Communist hard-currency shops. Tuzeks sells retro Czech design (the lamps and chairs are great). https://goo.gl/maps/L7u5hKYkTG62
In the last couple of years we’ve seen a lot of design stores open up, and one of my favorites is the Chemistry Design Store (https://www.facebook.com/thechemistrydesignstore/), which has a lot of funky prints, glasswork, and some of the coolest turntables I’ve ever seen (made by 440 Audio — http://www.440audio.eu/). I also love the Modernista store in several locations, including the House of the Black Madonna. They specialize in faithful reproductions of Czech art deco, cubist and modernist pieces, and they’re gorgeous. http://www.modernista.cz/?lang=en
The Museum of Decorative Arts is also off the beaten path and is excellent, and has a wonderful museum shop, also run by Modernista (https://goo.gl/maps/1WdovwAG1Ro). Bonus: The windows, especially the ones in the stairways, overlook the Jewish Cemetery. I’m of two minds on whether the cemetery itself is worth going to. It’s usually mobbed, and it’s pretty pricey to get in. But the synagogues are beautiful. I’d instead recommend the small Jewish cemetery under the Zizkov TV tower. While there, you can check out the bar up on top of the TV tower, as well as checking out the Palac Akropolis, still my favorite concert venue in town, with two separate DJ bars.
I also like the scruffy Žižkov neighborhood where the Akropolis is located, which, pound for pound, has the highest concentration of bars, restaurants and cafes in town. That and the more upscale Vinohrady neighborhood next to it are good.
Being an old fart, I don’t get out as much as I’d like to. But when I do, I like the Naplavka riverwalk (https://goo.gl/maps/66HK8PEoGEH2) and the Krymska street neighborhood (https://goo.gl/maps/3PfbNjZEM5r). Naplavka is not so great in the wintertime, but is the place to be in spring and summer. And Krymska is ground zero for Prague hipsters. Pretty great.
Clubwise, some of Prague’s must-visit places include the Palac Akropolis (www.akropolis.cz), Roxy, Rock Cafe, Radost FX, and definitely the Cross Club, which must be seen to be believed — Atlas Obscura has a nice writeup here: http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-club
I live close to the up-and-coming Letna neighborhood, which is anchored by the Bio Oko arthouse cinema and cafe (https://goo.gl/maps/rLkuMmDs9YF2). That neighborhood has the National Technical Museum, a must-see for geeks (https://goo.gl/maps/a9h6YqqUp6v) and Letna Park’s beer garden (https://goo.gl/maps/Dqvzyh8HNEs), which has one of the best views in town. In between are all kinds of great cafes and bars.
I’d strongly recommend getting a metro pass for the time you’re here. It’s cheap and so much less hassle. I’d also recommend (if you have mobile data) the Google Maps app, which also gives you timetables and nearest transit stops.
Prague taxis are a total ripoff, and I definitely do not recommend taking a taxi from the street. Use one of the services instead. I use Tick Tack Taxi (www.ticktack.cz), Taxi AAA (http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/), and Uber, which works well (although, like everywhere, surge pricing is something to watch for).
If you’re heading toward Vienna, I’d recommend either Český Krumlov or Mikulov. Český Krumlov is one of my favorite places on the planet and an amazing UNESCO World Heritage site — it’s an entire town from the 14th century flawlessly preserved. Just gorgeous. Mikulov, in southern Moravia, is in the wine region, and is also a really nice place to be, moreso in summertime. Plus, there’s a nice waterpark just outside of town (http://www.aqualand-moravia.cz/en)/.
If you’re heading north toward Berlin, I’d recommend taking a day to check out Bad Schandau, a spa town with a kickass thermal bath (http://www.toskanaworld.net/web/en/therme_bad_schandau/home.asp), and the Czech and Saxon Switzerland national park, famous for its sandstone formations, including a couple of natural bridges.

Discovering Beautiful Prague Hacks
Ahoj!
Now,if you have visited the beloved continent Europe ,you already know what a gem it is for travelers.It’s almost safe to say that it is every traveler's dream destination. Not only does it have over 40 countries to be explored (most without any visa restrictions)it offers a chance to experience rich history and cultures given most European countries have different languages.This said I put myself on a challenge to explore the world a little bit more,to experience other cultures and appreciate the diversity it brings through travel and what better time to do so whilst living in Europe.This brings me to why am writing this article,I fell in love with the beautiful city Prague ever since I embarked on a 4 day trip to celebrate my birthday. It left a lasting impression because of its beauty and rich history and would like to share some hacks and tips for first time travelers based on my experience there.
1 . Pick an accommodation location that minimizes traveling
Even though Prague is a fairly affordable city in terms of cost of living ,i’d recommend finding accommodation around the namesti republiky . Here you’ll find a vast amount of key monuments within its vicinity (Kotva Department Store, Municipal House, Powder Tower, Czech National Bank and Palladium shopping mall) . In addition all other key places e.g Prague castle,National Theater,Jewish Quarter are accessible by foot hence you save on the 32czk ticket that allows you 90 mins of travel using the buses/trams/metros. However should you choose an accommodation that requires you take the public transportation i’d highly recommend taking the 3 day pass ticket that costs 310 CZK.
This is not a sponsored article but am sharing the accommodation that I stayed and felt I really had value for money
emporio-prague-apartments.com
2. Be smart when it comes to currency conversion
If you are arriving from other country you should know that Czech doesn’t use Euros and instead uses Czech koruna(CZK). Hence prior to getting here I would recommend either have some loose cash around 5 euros to change at the airport exchange bureaus which give an awfully bad rate or pay your transportation by card. Please note the ticket machines only accept coins or card.Ticket cost from the airport to the Namesti republiky city center costs 32 CZK which is an equivalent of about 1.28 euros.
Recommended Exchange bureaus that had the most competitive rates eXchange, Kaprova 14/13, 110 00 Josefov, Czechia
Alfa Prague S.r.o., Na Příkopě 957, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
Another important thing to be mindful about is the cash withdrawals or payments when using cards because of the bank conversions. Locals have recommended that its better to pay in czk than your bank currency when using a card for payments.
3.Maximize your itinerary (Use the free maps shared either in hotels or airport!)
Am sure if you google what to do in Prague in x number of days you’ll find tonnes of information. Whilst this is nice as it gives you an idea of what is available I highly recommend that you pick up the free maps offered at the airports on your way out,they are really handy in giving you a visual of where the places you ought to visit are!! I got a really cool map at the airport that had listed all the key places to visit,metro line guide and Prague city tourism information. I found this to be truly useful as it enabled me make an optimized visit schedule since I could see the location of each place I wanted to visit and the proximity to other places.
4.Book a free tour prior to arriving
You’d be amazed at how much you learn about Czech through these free tours which at the end you give whatever amount you see best.
Fun fact : Did you know which music Neil Armstrong took to the moon? wait for it…Antonín Dvořák’s New World Symphony is the answer! :) .He was a famous Czech composer. I didn’t know this until i had this tour :p.
Link to the free tour that i used
freewalkingtourprague.eu
5.Eat,Explore,Reflect and Repeat
Travelling is fun but even better when we can use that chance to learn about a new culture and people. Explore the local foods and experiences ,you must agree having Italian cuisine in Prague is probably a not so good idea. Also take time to reflect and appreciate the precious moments and memories made in the new place.
My short recommended list of top foods and things to do
Hidden gem I stumbled upon :Restaurace U Dvou Velbloudů, Kožná 474, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
Hidden gem i stumbled upon :Naše maso, Dlouhá 727/39, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
There are two points at the Charles bridge that you can make a wish (Statue of St John Nepomuk and the statue in the picture below) :) i made my wish for …
If you are a lover for animals this is totally worth it !. For (250 CZK) as entrance fee, I got to see so many amazing animals and reconnect with mother nature through the trail walks.
Accessing the Prague castle courtyards and gardens is free. The golden lane is free to access after closing hours (please note that the houses aren’t accessible however). Whilst you have plenty to do I highly recommend buying one of the tickets to access some Prague castle structures.Depending on which circuit you choose you either pay 350 CZK or 250 CZK. I chose to go with the circuit B ticket that gave me access to the Old Royal Palace,Basilica of St.George,Golden Lane and the St.Vitus’s Cathedral. There is so much history in these places and for a moment at the golden lane I felt as if I traveled back in time.
There’s so much to share and this is definitely not exhaustive . However I shared my top hacks I believe are handy for first time travelers to Prague. Thank you for taking time to read this article and don’t forget to share your Prague stories.
Dekuji!!

I spent this summer travelling around Europe and nowhere quite captured my attention and gave me that “I never want to leave” feeling as Prague.
From its incredible architecture to its pumping night life, I was lucky enough to have a good friend show me around the city for four days. If you could spare only a weekend or a whole lifetime this fairy tale hot spot would still never fail to entice and surprise.

We had explored many places before going to Prague because of our love to discover new places. Some of the places I list below are the places we had previously explored, and some of them we found by chance. PS: We tried to explore some concept places rather than the most popular places on this trip.
Cafefin is not a breakfast place where you can spend hours as we are used to. For example, you wake up so early, you’re in a hurry, you want to have a healthy and delicious breakfast. Then here is the right address! This busy and popular cafe is the first Vietnamese coffehouse in Prague. There are mini tables and the stools at the long bar that you can sit. The staff are incredibly friendly. The Vietnamese baguette category in the menu attracted our attention. Baguette varieties were not the kind we were used to, but I have to say that I liked it very much! The cafe is also known for its sweet chao rice and homemade yoghurt with black rice.
The weather was very cold in April. Therefore, when we were too cold, we would urgently sit in any café we found by chance. That’s also how we discovered Tricafe. :) Tricafe was such a pleasant place that we have wanted to stay for 2 hours. We felt like we were at home with old-looking wooden tables, armchair seats in our grandmothers’ house and rocking chairs. You could read books from their library or you could take a glance at drawings on the wall as a mini exhibition. By the way their coffee was pretty good.
Trdelnik has started to spread after Easter markets that were established in Czech Republic in 2002 and it has become one of the symbols of Prague. We have gone to Prague during Easter so we had the opportunity to experience it in the Easter markets. Trdelnik is made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick, then grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix. I’ve tried the Nutella version of it. You can find different versions of Trdelnik in various shapes and with different flavors. Especially in the summer, you can find Trdelnik with different kinds of ice cream in Prague.
Restaurant Bella Vista has the best view in the city. Its panoramic view stretches from the Petrin Tower all the way to Prague Castle Hillsides. It streches from the west to the north, it provides spectacular views of greenish copper cupolas, narrow cobblestone streets, bridges connecting both river banks and green gardens from red-roof tops of centuries-old houses. Actually, we had come here to visit the Strahov Monastery. After the visit to the monastery, this amazing view has made our day! We couldn’t leave there without drinking a green lager to the accompaniment of this view.
Kantyna is a restaurant where you can taste great meats in Prague. In the entrance part, you can choose the meats that you would like to eat in the butcher section or if you are in a hurry, you can prefer the meats that are already cooked. We chose to choose our meat from scratch and we started to wait at our table. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages are also available, but we wanted to try local beer with our meats. This was the first place we stopped by after we got off the plane. We were very lucky because this place was so close to the hostel. Since I got back from Prague, I’ve been telling everyone about this place. The meats were absolutely incredibly delicious.
Cafe Slavia was the place where Nazım Hikmet had written some poems in Prague. There is a portrait of Nazım Hikmet which is painted by one of the Czech artists. However, the place also inspired many important literary artists. Kafka also had been going to this cafe while writing his novels.
First of all, if you want to go this place, you have to make a reservation. That’s why we’ve waited too long to sit, but the friendly staff was really helpful. I really like their food presentation. They served a meat with a kind of bread that they called “knedliky” and cranberry marmalade. It was really delicious!
I’m a real John Lennon fan and that’s why I don’t recommend this place. We really wanted to have a drink at John Lennon Pub. However, we could not spend more than 10 minutes. Due to the fact that the waiters didn’t let us have a drink here. They said we could sit here if we ate something. If we only wanted to have a drink, we couldn’t sit even if there were available tables inside. There wasn’t anything there to connect with John Lennon except his photos. I would love to have waiters understand and embrace his spirit.
The Hemingway Bar is the most popular cocktail bar in Prague. This place deserves all highest points because of the friendly waitresses and the wide cocktail menu. The name of the cocktail in the photo is Snow Globe. I used to like to watch the snow globe when i was a kid. I felt the same feelings because of this cocktail. Watching the coconut particles brought me back to my childhood. If you travel to Prague, I’d say that you should go to Hemingway Bar.
Enjoy your trip!

My first trip to Prague was in 2015, and I have been living in Prague almost for a year now. Considering the touristic season is already here (it was more than 20 degrees whole week!), I thought I should better create a post answering questions that I get from friends about visiting Prague and share the places I visited for the last 3 years with you all.
This post is ideal if you are planning to visit Prague for a short amount of time (more than a day, less than a month) and want to visit the key places of the city according to my experience. The post is not giving clear transportation methods (how long it takes from A to B, which trams go there etc), and only intends to initiate a list of places that I find worth visiting at your first Prague trip.
Prague has a beautiful Old Town (Staré Mesto) and it is a perfect place to start your trip. There you can see the Prague Astronomical Clock (currently being renovated until August 2018) which is the oldest functioning astronomical clock in the world. You will find its place in old town by just joining the always-waiting tourist groups in front of the clock because every hour twelve apostles appear from small windows of the clock. This parade takes almost a minute and is definitely worth watching. If you want to read more about the figures and the apostles of the clock, read here.
After you walked around the Old Town, you can move to Charles Bridge (Karlův most) which is one of the bridges that crosses the Vltava River. The historical bridge hosts 30 sculptures and sculpture groups on its walls. Although it is the most crowded place in the daytime due to the heavy interest of tourists, you would not want to miss the view from the bridge and the daylight look on the sculptures. I recommend visiting the bridge again in the evening to experience the charming lit version of the bridge and the beautiful city under the evening lights one more time.
From the Charles Bridge you can connect to Kampa Island. There is a little channel called Čertovka (Devil’s Channel) with an old mill (not functioning anymore). Around the old mild there is a Vodník (can be translated as Water Demon) sitting and watching for the possible souls to store in porcelain bottles* :) At the same time, this happens to be my favourite part of Kampa Island. Also, there is a restaurant next to the mill, and it has a cute balcony and two tables outside, by looking to it I always think it can be good choice for a romantic dinner ❤
* In Czech folklore, it is believed that evil vodníci (plural of vodník) try to drown people when they happen to swim in their territory and store the souls of the drowned in porcelain bottles.
From the little channel bridge, you can walk to John Lennon Wall. In my opinion, currently it looks like more of a name+surname wall of the people who sprayed their names onto the wall, but it should be seen for the worthy cause of the wall, against wars, and inspired by John Lennon’s peaceful acts.
Kampa Park is very pretty in the spring, a must-see for visitors in summer. You can see bronze statues of three crawling babies*, by the Czech sculptor David Černý and have some photos with them like I did :) The sculptor is known as a controversial artist and you can find his installations at many different spots in Prague. For example, he is the artist behind the famous Head of Franz Kafka and Man Hanging Out; the man in the subject is Sigmund Freud who was born in Moravia, depicted as hanging by one hand not sure if to hold onto or let go.
* There is an ugly TV tower in Prague and some of the crawling babies added on it to make it a bit prettier. If you happen to visit TV tower area, you can see the crawling babies climbing to the tower :) The babies that climb to the tower are made from fiberglass, a bit lighter than their bronze siblings at Kampa Park :)
While you are at Kampa Island, you can visit Museum Kampa, one of the many modern art museums in Prague. I haven’t visited the museum myself but it is on my to-do list. You should find Kampa’s yellow penguins as they are pretty cute and don’t forget to check them again in the evening because they are also lit!
Another must-see place, and also very popular by all tourists, is Prague Castle (Pražský hrad). The castle complex is really big and considered the largest ancient castle in the world and St. Vitus Cathedral is situated within the complex. You can also get one of the best views of Prague from the walls surrounding the castle complex. I am known to take more photos whenever we visit the castle area with our guests who visit the castle for the first time :)
But what I like the most about the castle is the surrounding gardens. Awesomely designed gardens make spring/summer or for that matter any good weather trip worthwhile! Currently, as you can see at the first photo of the post, spring is very inviting, and the castle gardens are full of nice trees, flowers and awaking greens ❤ You can check all the gardens listed here: https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle-for-visitors/gardens
Talking about castles and nice weathers, I also recommend visiting Vyšehrad (means upper castle in Czech). From Vyšehrad, you can get an amazing river view one which you can’t get from Prague Castle. Probably by now, you already know that I can get very excited about city gardens, and as expected from me, I very much liked Vyšehrad gardens, too ❤
Prague is full of parks and gardens, and I am very grateful that I am living in a city that everybody can access the green areas easily! We (me and my husband) are living in Vinohrady (means vineyards in Czech) and the closest park to us is Grébovka. As declared in the name of Vinohrady, Grébovka also has one remaining vineyard from the many historical vineyards once covered all park area in the 14th century. The vineyard has a cute wooden gazebo restaurant & wine bar where they can also have weddings :) And my favourite part of the vineyard is that it also has a winery where you can get the wine of the same vineyard ❤
In my opinion, Grébovka is the most romantic park in Prague and we enjoy our evening walks (even more romantic, thanks to the authentic street lamps of Prague ❤) there. If you’re staying in the same area, I recommend checking this park as well, if you like daylight park visits more, picnic season is already open!
Up until now, I listed almost all the basic touristic must-see places in Prague. If your trip is 2–3 days long, you possibly have enough places to discover in the city. But if you are more like nature-lover type and prefer doing outdoor activities maybe you can also check the nature parks I enjoyed visiting.
Divoká Šárka (Wild Šárka) is a nature reserve and named after a female mythological warrior Šárka. There is a small canyon in the park, and it is pretty good for trekking. As a plus, you can also have a nice view after you climb the hill. It is a perfect place for enjoying nature in Prague without getting too far* from the city.
* From where we live, it takes about an hour to get there, but it totally worths the effort.
Stromovka is a very beautiful and large park. It was established in the 13th century as a game reserve and converted into a park later in 19th century. The park has a style of an English landscape garden, and there is a pond that I liked very much spending time around it.
Prokopské údolí (Prokop Valley) is an amazing place to see and from where we live it takes almost the same time as Šárka to go there. There are two small rivers, a beautiful lake, and a natural reserve area. There are playgrounds for children and benches to rest if you want to have a rest. When we first visited the area, I fell in love with nature there, and I want to visit as much as possible this year.
These are all my favourite outdoor spaces so far and let me know if you can suggest some more for me to visit this year!
Before we finalise the post, I want to mention two places I saw families with kids enjoying their time there, and you might want to add these places to your travel plan if you have children.
Disclaimer: We don’t have a child so that I don’t have a personal experience in any of the places that I recommend from a child-friendly view. I just thought it might give some ideas to the guests with kids.
Prague Zoo is a very good place to visit, even if you are not a child nor have a child :) But I highly recommend, if you have a child ❤ The admission price for a family of 4 (2 parents + 2 children) is 600 CZK (about 24 EUR — April 2018). I usually have mixed feelings about the zoos but this one does not feel like an animal prison, instead, the animals have a lot of space, they wander seemingly freely and inspire kids to learn about them in a natural looking and feeling setup. When I visited the zoo in 2015, I thought except polar animals all animals are doing fine, but the condition of polar animals did not seem enough to me to support them in Prague hot summer :(
I know, Prague Zoo was seriously damaged when the flood hit the city in 2002, and hope the animals will get better treatment after the flood’s effects completely reverted.
My second suggestion for families with kids would be visiting Mořský svět (Sea World) Aquarium. It was relatively small and boring for adults but kids were having a lot of fun there when we visited the aquarium in 2016. The ticket price for a family of four is 850 CZK (about 34 EUR — April 2018).
Overall, I think Prague is an enchanting city with its different styles of architecture from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era. Dark towers, colourful and unique style of historical buildings, doors, windows, bridges, and cobblestone streets (unpack those high heels now!) carries the memories of a long eventful history. Prague also offers a great deal of green within the city with parks and natural areas. I think everyone can find a reason to love Prague and bring good memories back to home, or maybe make it their new home ❤

The first time I travelled to the Czech Republic was in the early 1990s. Communism was collapsing and, despite the obvious scars of decades of oppression, there was hope in the air. Modern and democratically leaning, Czechia (yes it’s really called that now) along with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia (or the Visegrad Group) showed promise in bridging the East-West divide. I’ve travelled back many times since, happily noting the transformation of Prague from a city behind the Iron Curtain to a modern, upbeat, western city that has retained cool elements of its communist past.
To me, no neighbourhood displays this better than Žižkov — a grittier, historically working-class quarter infused with hipster cafés, craft brew pubs, and cool retro designers. With its awesome blend of old and new Prague, Žižkov is not to be missed.
FRIDAY4PM Shake off the jet lag with a nice walk in Park Rajská Zahrada and stop by the beer garden for a quick refreshment before heading out to dinner.
6PM Nothing beats jet lag better than Czech comfort food and a well poured beer. Head to Hostinec U Vodoucha, a classic hospoda packed with locals, for an authentic experience. I suggest the Pork Knuckle (189 koruna) and a pint of Mordýř 12° (45 koruna). The richness of the pork combined with the pickled veggies and a good lager to wash it down can’t be beat.
9 PM After dinner walk back to Namesti Jiří z Podebrad to take in nighttime views of the church, Kostel Nejsvětějšího Srdce Páně, and then head underground to BeerGeek. A craft brew house that’s constantly rotating its great selection of draft beers, they also offer small bites including a HUGE selection of chicken wings (monkey wings) that pair perfectly with what’s on tap. The bar’s warm, fun atmosphere draws people in and it can get pretty crowded on a Friday night so if you’d rather climb back into bed, check out their selection of to-go beers.
SATURDAY9AM Rise and shine! Žižkov is home to Vitkov Hill, a national monument to Jan Žižka’s victory over the Crusaders in 1420. It’s also a great place to take a quick run or hike to wake up. If you climb to the top you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of Prague from the base of the massive equestrian statue of Jan Žižka.
11 AM Refreshed, and having taken in the stunning views of Prague head back down to My Coffee Story. A modern, neighbourhood coffee shop that serves great espresso and a nice selection of breakfast foods. Try the soft boiled eggs, Tri vejce ve skle, (135 koruna) or the homemade waffle with fresh fruit and mascarpone (110 koruna) to get your morning started off right.
1PM Žižkov is home to some great up-and-coming local designers. A few of my favorite shops include the über hip, cult, Czech bag brand, Playbag on Borivojova and Botas 66 on Krizkovskeho, which carries a wide range of runners, designed after Communist era Czech sport shoes, Botas or botasky. With new designs ranging from whimsical rainbow to classic brown leather this stop is sure to be a hit no matter what your style.
Let the Communist exploration continue with a visit to Bohemian Retro, a vintage shop specializing in items from pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. Despite the selection being a little more tired than I remember, it is still worth a quick stop. A more modern assortment of women’s wear can be found at SugarBat, which carries a wide variety of retro clothing that they describe as “pin-up, rockabilly and goth styles.” Nearby, on Mánesova, lingerie designer Zuzana Kubickova’s showroom and studio has a stunning selection of women’s intimates along some beautiful outerwear collections.
3PM Czechs love to grab coffee and a sweet afternoon snack. Stop by the newly opened Donut Shop and grab a coffee and brown-butter (56 koruna), or maple-bacon (54 koruna) doughnut to-go. Do as the locals do, and head back to the many benches at the square to enjoy your snack while you take in the sites and do a little people watching.
4PM Freshly refueled, or perhaps in need of another cup of coffee, saunter on over to Jirak Farmer’s Market. Described by Taste of Prague as “one of the best things to do in Prague,” this quaint market has the rare distinction of being on Wednesday to Saturday. The food and decorations change with the season, and the selection of fresh fruits, meats, coffee, wine and hot food items in fabulous. People rave about the crepes from Galetka, and the coffee from Kavovy Klub.
5PM End your shopping experience with a visit to NeverEnough. The local design shop sports an in-house bar, great music and friendly staff. Grab a cocktail or beer while perusing NeverEnough brandwear (my favourite) in addition to a more limited selection of shirts from several European designers.
8PM For upscale food in a relaxed environment, head to Riccardo Lucque’s La Bottega Gastronomica. The airy bistro has perfect window seats overlooking Mahlerovy Sady Park which makes for great people watching while enjoying the fine selection of delicious daily dishes, homemade pasta and divine wines.
SUNDAY10AM A visit to Prague wouldn’t be complete without a classic Czech breakfast of koláč from Antoninovo Pekarstvi. Be sure to try the makovy (poppy seed), and tvaroh (similar to cottage cheese), as well as the seasonal fruit selection. Apricot is always a favourite.
Noon The strange, somewhat ugly TV tower, with freaky climbing babies, built on an old Jewish cemetery defines Žižkov’s (and Prague’s) landscape. To catch a wonderful last bird’s eye view, take the elevator to the observatory (230 koruna) where you can watch films about Prague.
WHERE TO STAYAirBnB has a great selection of apartments for rent that are perfectly located to enjoy the most of Žižkov. Use this link to get a $40 credit!

It’s kind of ridiculous that I’m writing about Prague, my first destination after my month long program on my last leg of the trip in Croatia. But Prague represents a special place for me as it was a place to drown my depressed state with cheap delicious beer after studying the Holocaust intensively for a month.
Prague is a popular destination for not only Europeans but also the floods of Asian tourists who come in huge groups on massive coaches. Why do they all come halfway around the world?
Could it be the Charles Bridge where brilliant performers and caricature artists invade the sides of the bridge? Or is it the famously disappointing Old Astronomical Clock that leaves eager crowds to the tip of their toes every hour only to realize its short act?
The infamous tourist attractions of Prague are deserving of their title as some sights really reward your hard earned tourist dollars. For example, the nightscape of Prague Castle and Charles Bridge is ridiculously beautiful and one to be remembered.
But if you have at least more than a day in Prague, the rest of the city is worth exploring and may even outweigh the attractions listed in your Lonely Plant or Rick Steve’s guide. Even 5 nights here wasn’t enough to get a full taste of Prague, but if you need some ideas, take a look at my suggestions below!
Nábřeží Edvarda Beneše, 118 00 Praha 7, Czechia
I hate to see this place getting busier than it already is with the locals enjoying their beer (32 crowns for half a litre if I’m not mistaken) over sweeping Panorama views. Forget Petrin Park, you want to check out Letna Park for its many beer gardens, musicians/DJs and also friendly vibes.
Head to the red Metronome statue in the centre of the park and on top of the stairs (above the beer gardens) which was built to symbolize the long struggle against communism. Here you will see a familiar skate park for those 90’s kids that remember Tony Hawk’s skateboarding games. On the other side you will see a magnificent panorama of Old and New Prague.
V Pevnosti 159/5b, 128 00 Praha 2, Czechia
This one is a little more well-known with tourists, but it still deserves a spot on my list because it is expansive enough to make you feel like you’re the only one in the park. Relatively close to the Old Town, when the city starts getting hot and bustling with the package tours, escape to Vyšehrad for some peace and beautiful views.
Some of Prague’s oldest buildings are housed here, so for history geeks like myself, it’s such a treat.
Kostelní 1320/42, 170 78 Praha 7, Czechia
If you’re looking for some unconventional but well done museums, avoid the Communism museum — made up of cheap write ups and replicas of everything, and come to the National Technical Museum! Being an Arts student, I try to stay away from anything technical. But the inner boy in me came out when I saw the museums impressive fleet of cars, motorcycles, and planes. The museum itself is quite large and also has some historical context of the importance of these products so to add the technological aspect of experiencing Prague, the technical museum is an awesome alternative to the traditional museums.
Also students get a discount so make sure you bring your ISIC card or school ID with the years on it.
1, 120 00 Praha 2-Vinohrady, Czechia
This one was a bit of a lucky find along the way to Vyšehrad. It’s a quiet park that’s tucked in a nicer neighbourhood of Prague and I highly recommend grabbing some groceries and setting up picnic. If you’re lazier like me and enjoy beer more than bread, bring a bottle(s) and head out to the terrace in front of the classy restaurant in the middle. Here you will see another magnificent panorama of the newer areas of the city.
This one is a bit of a cheat because it’s not really in Prague, but it’s close proximity to the city with loads of sights make it an awesome way to escape the swarm of tourists. While Kutna Hora can be done within half a day, for those that take longer or would appreciate having quaint peace, a night or two wouldn’t hurt either!
Some sights in Kutna Hora include the infamous Sedlec Ossuary or AKA the Bone church (which is extremely short and close to being a tourist trap if it wasn’t for the freaky nature of having so many bones displayed openly), St. Barbara’s Church, and the Jesuit College — which generally opens exhibitions and other galleries.
A quick tip for travellers by train, make sure you purchase the ticket that goes to Kutna Hora Město. The main railway station for Kutna Hora is actually quite a bit ways from the actual town so make sure you remember to transfer into a smaller local train to take you to the Město.
The fact that I am able to remember these places at the top of my head must mean something. I hope you will also enjoy some of the places shared to me by locals, fellow backpackers, and Google. If you enjoyed these travel ideas for Prague and would like to see them for the other cities, let me know with a comment or a like!

musings from a solo trip around the world

I always thought eastern Europe would be cold and grey and Prague is no exception. But, as I walk past grungy stone walls under a slate sky, I notice the city’s canvas begin to fill with color. Each loud scarf or alleyway stencil builds anticipation toward my colorful destination, The Lennon Wall. However, as I weave through the side streets of this quiet, cobblestoned neighborhood in search of this mural homage to the late Beatle’s front-man, the wall is nowhere to be found! Just before I turn to my map for guidance, I spot a huddle of travelers staring at a simple message written across whitewashed facade in the distance. “Wall Is Over.”
All that remains from this crowdsourced feat of artistic expression were these big block letters. What a buzz kill! But then, as I look closer, I see a streak of fresh paint coloring the outline of an umbrella in the bottom right corner. Maybe this is a more apt portrait of Prague’s beauty. A place with a medieval core spared from world-war destruction, a towering castle beyond the reach of any mere mortal, and a body of citizens freed from communism just 15 years prior still teems with the rumblings of creative individuality. Just hours after the wall was painted over, as is customary practice every four years, the people have already begun to fill the space with life.
Prague is alive. The buildings’ imposing exteriors contain the thumping passion of proud Czechs. I could hear the city’s collective effervescence in the the fraternal “Čau!” as anyone enters or leaves a room or through the cracked window of an underground pub. The beer is cheap, tasty, and omnipresent. More signs for Pilsner Urquell (the local water) fill the streets than stoplights. With early sunsets, bars that never close, and pints that range from $1–1.50 USD, it is no wonder Prague’s happening nightlife is no secret to the world. One simply needs to step outside to hear packs of fashionable young people that make the streets feel like the hallways of the United Nations. To walk the streets is to share a drink with both the buildings and their inhabitants — each additional round bringing you closer to the city’s pulsing soul.
It is hard to decide whether the streets are more beautiful by day or by night. By day, the signature burnt orange roofs that top the baroque buildings give the old town a sense of cohesion, as if to cross the Charles Bridge is to step into a 14th century universe. By night, streaks of light shoot up Gothic facades like shooting stars, creating long shadows that imbue even the most ordinary storefront with a sense of magic. The Vlatava River snakes through the city like a moat for the Castle, while trams carry the lifeblood that courses through the city’s veins. Prague’s hip energy remains inclusive and accessible. Like leaving a dinner party at the house of an incredibly welcoming host, I felt a sense of home that demands a speedy return.

Ages ago I promised my wife Anne a trip to Prague, one of the European capitals she had never visited. I finally got round to organising it this year.
This piece is not about our destination, but about our journey. We try to avoid unnecessary flights and last year we bought a Tesla Model 3, so why not make it a road trip? We wanted to document what it is like to travel by Tesla. Other electric vehicles are available but I cannot speak with any authority about what the experience of driving them on a similar trip might be. Moreover, if you are looking for tips about Prague, or other cities, look elsewhere.
Prague is about 1100 km from where we live west of Paris. After consulting the road atlas, the Tesla website and various guides to the Czech Republic we decided on a six-day trip. Two days driving, with a stopover in Heidelberg, two nights in Prague, two in Karlovy Vary, and one in Luxembourg on the way back, (thereby knocking a second unvisited European capital off the list).
Having chosen where we wanted to go, and when, we let Tesla make most of the remaining choices. We picked hotels which had Tesla destination chargers, and where there was a choice went as close to the city centre as possible1. We weren’t trying to do this on a budget (it was a birthday present after all), and once in the hotels we wanted to be able to visit our destinations without getting into the car again.
No visas were required for us, but we did have to get two for the car: the German emissions sticker that allowed us in to Heidelberg city centre, and the Czech motorway vignette.
I usually charge my Model 3 to around 90 per cent, which gives around 430 km of range. The car warns against frequent charging above 90% and the last 10% is slow, but for long trips I push it up to 95 per cent (around 470 km) which I did on this occasion.
As we packed we kept a watchful eye on the developing coronavirus situation. By 29 February France had identified 73 cases of Covid-19. Germany 79. The situation in Northern Italy was causing serious concern, but travel to and from Germany, the Czech Republic and Luxembourg was not subject to controls2.
Sunday 1 March Home to Heidelberg (659 km)
The plan was that this would involve about six hours driving and one hour charging. The on-board route planner suggested charging at the Reims-Champagne services on the A4 for 15 minutes and then again near Metz for 25. But I managed to drive past the chargers in the service area and couldn’t legally turn back so we had to go on to the next exit, turn round, charge on the Paris-bound side, and then complete the circuit by continuing to the next exit towards Paris and turning round again. Wasted time about 40 minutes; wasted distance about 60 kilometres.
Our second charging stop was in Hauconcourt near Metz, and by the time we had had a quick lunch we were charged up and in danger of incurring idle charges3.
Tesla superchargers in France are frequently located in hotel car parks (often Accor brands) near to but not on the autoroute. This means that you don’t have to be on the motorway to have access to them. However some, such as Reims-Champagne are in the motorway service areas, and others — such as Metz are in commercial centres.
We reached Heidelberg in time to have a walk around the Altstadt and up to the castle before it got dark. We put the car on charge in the hotel car park overnight.
Monday 2 March Heidelberg to Prague (513 km)
Wanting to maximize our time in Prague we drove straight there, stopping only to buy our Czech motorway vignette and to recharge at the last supercharger in Germany (Wernberg-Kôblitz). Most of the route was on the A6 through southern Germany, which was consistently busy with trucks, but no serious congestion. Many junctions and bridges had roadworks so speed limits kept oscillating between 80, 100, 120 and 130 kph, and for some stretches, no limit at all. Prudence (the name I have given the car in recognition of her cautious approach to overtaking and driving in general) effortlessly accelerated to 180 kph, but I didn’t test her beyond that, and didn’t keep that up for long.
We crossed the border into the Czech republic without really noticing it, and certainly without having to stop which, for someone who grew up and lived for almost 40 years with an Iron Curtain across Europe, still came as a surprise. The car took us by what seemed a circuitous route round the back of the castle to our hotel, but when we saw the streets that a more direct approach would have involved we understood why.
Tuesday 3 March Prague (0 km)
Our hotel was ideally situated between the Old Town and the Castle. Trams and buses abound, but we were close enough to walk everywhere.
Wednesday 4 March Prague to Karlovy Vary (129 km)
After 48 hours in Prague we made the short journey to Karlovy Vary. The road was busy with trucks, and being upgraded in various stretches, but we had no hold-ups and no hiccups.
This once-grand spa town has an abundance of C19 and early C20 hotels crowded round the river and thermal springs. After checking in to an elegant and imposing hotel — again chosen because of its Tesla destination charger — we had plenty of time to walk around, get our bearings, and find some dinner.
Thursday 5 March: Karlovy Vary (O km)
A beautiful sunny day ideal for a good long walk in the woods and some time in the pool.
Friday 6 March: Karlovy Vary to Luxembourg (783 km)
A 9 o’clock start for a full day of driving, under grey skies and with a lot of rain, sleet and drizzle. As before we followed Tesla’s suggested route, driving through the Fichtel Mountains and the forests of Franconia before stopping three hours out from Karlovy Vary in the small town of Motten. Here, in what seemed like the middle of nowhere, we found a brand-new 16-stall Supercharger at which we were the only customer. We also found the wonderful Gasthof zum Biber where we had an early, and copious, lunch.
Motten was right for our East-West journey, but I suspect most of its users will be from the nearby A7 motorway which takes traffic from Northern Germany to Italy.
We saw at first hand quite how many trees there are this part of Germany, and were encouraged to see how many fields have been covered in part with solar panels.
From Motten we were able to get to Luxembourg, albeit with only about 30 kilometres left in the ‘tank’. The most difficult part of the journey was the last 500 metres to the hotel because of extensive road works around the station. I have to confess to a certain amount of ‘range concern’ if not full-blown ‘range anxiety’ but took comfort in Elon Musk’s assurance that there are 10–20 km of reserve capacity even after the screen reads empty. And if the worst came to the worst I could pull in to any service station/hotel/business with a standard electric plug and hook up to that for a while.
Once again, we had chosen the hotel not only because of its convenient location, but also because it has a destination charger. And for the first time the network let us down, because it is an older charger which does not recognise the Model 3 (at least, it wouldn’t connect with ours). Fortunately there was an adjacent Mennekes charger, which the hotel staff advised us to use.
Day 7: Luxembourg to home (418 km)
The car was fully-charged by the morning, and after a couple of hours walking around the historic centre of Luxembourg, and a detour to leave Luxembourg because of the same road works we had encountered on the way in, we headed straight home. Again one brief charging stop, at the same Reims-Champagne services we used on the way out. We could have made it without charging but we would not have been able to drive at 130 kph.
Afterword
I had considered before setting out whether to subscribe to the Chargemap Pass4, or one of the alternative networks of chargers5, for added peace of mind, but decided against, wanting to test the Tesla network.
The test was passed. During the six days we drove a total of 2373 km consuming 426 KwH of electricity at an average consumption of 180 Wh per kilometer. Much of the trip was on motorways where we maintained a cruising speed of 130 kph, sometimes more. We had lights on for the great majority of the trip, and wipers for much of it too.
We missed one Supercharger because we didn’t follow the instructions closely enough; and one exit because we weren’t paying attention to the navigation system. The busiest supercharger we came across (Metz) had five stands occupied out of eight, at the others there were only one or two other cars, and none at all in Motten. The destination chargers all worked well except the last.
We had one screen restart while driving, which was disconcerting, but lasted only 40 seconds or so.
I make a lot of use of the basic level of Autopilot (Traffic-aware cruise control), primarily so I don’t have to maintain pressure with my right leg. It is particularly useful in dense traffic which is running at low speeds or stopping and starting. I use Autosteer and Navigate on Autopilot more sparingly, and find that they work best in relatively empty roads. The driving habits of other drivers are sometimes more aggressive than Autosteer is comfortable with: for example if I pull out to overtake, and then — as often happens — the car behind me pulls out at more or less the same time, and close behind — the Tesla will abort the manoeuvre, sensing danger. That is safe, but unnecessarily prudent — hence my pet name for the car.
Our Supercharger stops cost about €80 in all for a total of 270 KwH; recharging the battery at home to the level at which we started will have cost about €10. Had we taken our old (diesel) car we would have used about 150 litres, at least €200 worth of fuel.
The remaining electricity was included in our overnight parking. The autoroutes in France cost about €60 in total, and we spent €25 on vignettes. That gives a total non-accommodation cost about €175, although that takes no account of depreciation on the car.
We could have flown to Prague for about the same basic price, but to that we would have had to add airport transfers, and if we wanted to see Karlovy Vary as well, taxi or bus fares.
We drove through four countries, visited two capital cities, two historic towns and a couple of places we’d never heard of before.
As of Friday 13 March the Czech Republic has closed its borders. When the world calms down, we’d consider similar trips to other European cities.
_____________
1. Hotels: Crowne Plaza, Heidelberg; Hoffmeister, Prague; Savoy Westend, Karlovy Vary; Radisson Park, Luxembourg.
2. Anne guessed that by the time we returned there would be 300 cases of Covid-19 in France, I guessed 500. In fact there were 700, and it was becoming clear that that was almost certainly an underestimate. We tried to avoid crowds and — at the time of writing — have experienced no unusual symptoms. Whether we were increasing or reducing our risk, or the risk to others, by travelling we have no idea.

My ranking: 4.5 stars out of 5
Heading to Prague, Czech Republic? My top pool pick is the Podolí Swimming Stadium. There are a number of pools to choose from including the newish Aquacentre Šutka but I have selected the Podolí pool as #1 as it is historically interesting and the 3 pools are amazing.
The pool complex was built in the 1960s on the site of a former quarry mine along the river Vltava. It was recently added to the national cultural monuments of the Czech Republic.
You have three pools to explore here! The complex features both an outdoor AND indoor 50m pool, a 33m long outdoor diving pool, a huge spiraling slide, a steam room, a Finnish sauna (wood-burning stove), a solarium, a rehabilitation centre and a restaurant. I am a big fan of swimming rehabilitation so it was nice to see the rehab services prominently displayed. We don’t promote this much externally in BC/Canada?
The inside pool (pictured above) is designed with a big wave along the roof by Czech architect Richard Podzemny. The large viewing area for the outdoor pool is situated on top of the wavy roof. The pool is deep, clean and well maintained with crystal clear water. You need to go through the warm drying off area, showers and then wash your feet as you exit to the pool, which helps keep the water nice and clean.
I had a fantastic swim in each of the pools on a hot summer evening. My favourite was the indoor 50m which was quiet and peaceful as everyone was outside enjoying the sun.
I was surprised at the lack of lifeguards! For 3 pools they had two lifeguards in bright orange shorts (that we saw; perhaps it was a shift change or they’re in disguise?). However, the lifeguards were very active in patrolling and telling people what not to do such as jumping off the side edge into the pool. They may or may not have blown the whistle at my kids.😬
The change rooms are old and Soviet-era looking but they have modernized the locker system. When you arrive you’re given a wrist band (pictured here below on my son). You use this to enter and exit the facility and it connects to a locker of your choice. Very cool!
One interesting thing is that this pool is connected to Czech Television at the top of the hill, improving the energy use of both. Cold water is pumped up to the TV building to cool down the studio rooms and servers. The heated water is then pumped back to the stadium and heats up the pool. The water never drops below 26C, even in the outdoor pool in the winter.
Finished your swim? Make sure to stop by the restaurant on-deck and pick up a pint of beer and “Nakládaný Hermelín” (Czech marinated cheese — a classic Czech pub food, one of my favourites).

Last weekend I had the pleasure to spend two wonderful days in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. It was my second time there but I was shocked because of the beauty of the city. My first time there has been in winter, therefore it was a completely different atmosphere now with sunshine in the middle of the summer.
I visited Prague with my boyfriend and despite hours of sightseeing and enjoying summer vibes there was one thing that we both realized quite soon when we arrived.
Most of the people seemed completely unhappy and were extremely unfriendly.
As we are both entrepreneurs by heart we are always curious and constantly looking around for new learnings, even during our travels. Also when sitting on the train to Prague we were talking about what exciting things we were probably going to discover and how we could make a business out of those things but what we actually found out was quite different.
I did not do any research on this and probably we, by coincidence, met a couple of the few unfriendly people in Prague but it was significantly obvious, thus I want to share our experiences.
In fact, Viennese people are told to be extremely impolite people. Viennese cafès even have the most impolite waitresses, that’s something…

A personal tour guide of Prague and Czech Republic

Edgar Krása, one of the survivors of the Nazis concentration camps, died in February 2017. As he had mentioned in one of the interviews, “It won’t be long before there won’t be anybody left who can tell this.” That’s why he dedicated the last years of his life to traveling and talking about his experiences from the WW2. And he was right, less and less people it is who remember those horrors. And they won’t be there to speak of them forever. So, it is only up to us to carry their stories to future generations. To know some of these stories, you just need to walk a bit through the streets of Prague.
Many tourists wonder how Prague could survive the war without any significant damage. Not that much true though, but comparing to other cities in Europe, Prague was one of the lucky ones. In this post you’re going to see only the most important buildings connected with the Nazi occupation. There are more of them throughout the city, of course. Furthermore, I am not mentioning the Jewish Quarter, which is a special chapter and is a must visit when talking about the war times.
We all know about the terrible bombing of Dresden in February 13–14th 1945. But did you know that because of a navigation error, several planes of US Army Air Force managed to get to Prague? They dropped about 152 tons of bombs onto the city of Prague, 700 people died and about one hundred historical sights and building were destroyed. One of them was the 14th century Emmaus Monastery, where you can today admire a new roof with two towers that was added in 1960s. Even though the big part of the church was damaged, its gothic features survived.
Another witness of the bombing is the Dancing House — designed by Vlado Milunic and Frank Gehry in 90s. The original house that used to stand there was also destroyed during the bombing.
On 15 March 1945 Hitler entered Prague and proclaimed the country the german Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Hitler spent several hours here, always wished to return back. The honour guard formed on the first courtyard of Prague Castle and then Hitler took the famous picture overlooking the city from the window of the palace. This photo even became the official post stamp.
Just around the corner from the Wenceslas square stands the monumental building of Petschek Palace. It was build shortly before the WW2 for the merchant banker Julius Petchek, with all the modern gadgets such as tube post or paternoster lift. During the Nazi occupation the Palace became the Gestapo headquarters. The horrific tortures and interrogations took place in its basement, and there is a small exhibition about what happened in the rooms nowadays.
Not very far from the Jewish quarter, walking towards the river, you will find a building with triangle roof that belongs to the Law Faculty of Charles University. During the WW2 it was actually used as a seat of the SS with the nearby hospital Na Františku serving as a military hospital for the pilots of Luftwaffe.
The Butcher of Prague or The Blond beast are two (of many more) nicknames of Reinhard Heydrich, the new governor of Czech lands. He arrived to Prague in 1941 and immediately started persecutions of Czech political and intellectual personalities. He also gave orders to establish a ghetto and to start with the Jewish transports. He eventually paid for all what he did to Czechs in 1942 when two Czechoslovakian paratroopers from the resistance tried assassinate him. To know how it all happened you have to visit the church of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in New Town district. There is not only very interesting exhibition with many historical photographs, but still visible traces of the Nazi hunt.
The offices of Heydrich were situated in the Černín Palace, just above the Prague Castle complex. For some time Heydrich also did live here, but he later moved out of Prague to Panenské Břežany where he found a nice chateau for his family. The Černín Palace is the office of the minister of Foreign Affairs today.
The effort to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation in May 1945 is called the Prague Uprising. It all began on May 5th and lasted for three long days. About 30 thousands Czechs decided to fight with the Nazi army of 40 thousand. At the end, the Russian army marched into the city which meant the end of the war was getting close. Many historical buildings in the city centre were lost, and many of them on the Wenceslas Square for example. Czech casualties counted to almost 1700.
Old Town Square wasn’t spared either. We all are familiar the iconic view of the Town Hall, but not that many people realize that almost half of it is missing, actually burned down on May 8th, 1945.
Unfortunately, there’s so much left to say, but that would only make the article not bearable for reading. To find out more about WW2 in Prague, you’re welcome join me on my Prague WWII tour.

Žižkov, Anděl, Budějovická, Hradčanská, Staroměstská, Náměstí Míru, Háje…?
What do these weird Czech names mean and how does the area look like?
Prague is divided into districts, as you may already found out, those districts are divided into smaller parts with a specific name and also specific lifestyle you can experience.
During my Prague´s life I have lived in many various parts of the Prague city. I was also lucky enough to meet with wide range of experiences Prague can offer. After all I have decided to share my point of view and try to do a short, but hopefully an accurate review about those different districts.
Now, let´s come back to our — still for now — unknown Prague´s district called Prague 3 or in Czech Praha 3: if you are already in crazy mood of your Erasmus and want to practice Czech language, you nerd!
The district includes officially most of the cadastral area of Žižkov and parts of Vinohrady, Vysočany and Strašnice.
This district varies a lot as you move from one site to the oppossite one. Around “borders” with other districts, like Prague 2 (Vinohrady), Prague 10 (Strašnice) and Prague 9 (Vysočany) it lives their own life. Žižkov, the main part of P3, is less international than P2 or P1. You will also come across some really old and damaged buildings or even abandoned, but that´s what makes its spirit.
When I was going through this area I felt like in 80´s in Czech republic, life after the revolution.
It´s a calmer area, older Czech people are living here, but don´t worry, you won´t feel like in a retirement home. There are many cafes around and pubs as well. You should check out Café Pavlač, for instance!
Žižkov and P3, in general, offers a wide range of flats for rent. Flats are mainly less expensive, situated in older tall buildings — typicall for Czech republic. As I am mentioning in a Lifestyle paragraph, you will meet older people with their dogs, also some Gypsies, however you can still live in a luxurious flat and rock a world from Vítkov hill or Žižkov´s tower (highest peek in Prague by the way).
Itself is a bit different. I would express it as more Czech not so international part, a bit older, not playing a theatre for tourists. It is also more industrial with older buildings. Its highlight is certainly Vítkov park — if you want to feel a true history as a though guy, go there! At the hill took a place one of the main battles of Hussite wars. If you are still being nerdy, calm down, I have not forgotten, Žižkov is also an area of Franz Kafka — a famous Czech writer! By the way the name Žižkov comes from a name Jan Žižka, who was Czech general and Hussite leader, follower of Jan Hus — simply a though guy with one eye.
As you see above, Žižkov area also offers some architecture craziness as climbing babies at a tower, but also many interesting corners for you to observe in old Prague.
Thank you for reading this article. Don’t forget to share it to every friend coming to Prague! And to be notified for the next article, subscribe with your email over here: flatbuddy.beer

Prague is truly remarkable. For me, it will always be the most beautiful city in the world. Even though I have spent the majority of my life in Prague and should know the city inside-out, there is always something astonishing to learn!
Upon my research, I found that there’s much more to this stunning city than most residents will ever realise. Here are 8 things that I didn't know about this gem!
Prague's Jewish Quarter is one of the most popular areas, it includes the cemetery and Europe oldest synagogue. It is said that Adolf Hitler planned to retire in Prague and preserve this area as a museum to an extinguished race, that is why he didn’t destroy it when he had a chance.
Currently, the Jewish Museum in Prague manages this collection of 6 synagogues, historical relics, and a Holocaust memorial.

By Jacques Poitras
MATT WELCH WAS back in Prague for the Party at the End of the World. It was March 1, 1995, and the newspaper and the life he had created for himself were crumbling in the old cobblestone streets of the Czech capital. Prognosis, the English-language rag he had launched five years earlier with a few friends, had ceased publishing; tonight, a final, drunken bash would send it off into history.
Before heading to the party at Rock Club Bunkr, a bar housed in a former Communist nuclear bomb shelter, Welch, some of the other founders, and a few friends ducked into U Vejvodů, a traditional Czech pub. They reminisced about all the struggles going back to the beginning. Charlie Hornberger, the paper’s last editor-in-chief, described closing down the office. Welch shared anecdotes from the Budapest Business Journal, where he’d taken a job two months earlier. At their feet sat bundles of newspapers: the cover of the final issue of Prognosis showed a Communist-built apartment complex crumbling under the headline “The End.”
That possibility had been looming for months, even years. Prognosis had never made a single koruna in profit. Then again, that had never been the point. “Though it misfired and miscued on more than one occasion,” Welch wrote in a goodbye essay, “Prognosis at its full bloom was one of the most ferociously good newspapers any part of the world has ever seen. There is no satisfaction that can compare to this essential fact, nor any disappointment that can diminish its luster. Prognosis was, for nearly four full years, the exact sum of what the editorial staff imagined a great newspaper should be.”
And now it was over. Along with those defiant superlatives, Welch’s essay dished out an equal helping of self-pity. The other founders of the paper had postponed promising careers to embark on this adventure with him; “I, as a college dropout with little experience at anything, had nothing except an exaggerated sense of self-worth,” he wrote. “I am acutely aware that my life, such as it is right now, exists because of this newspaper and this experience called Prognosis. … Fact is, I now have something akin to a viable life, and the tangible source of that life is now dead.”
Prague was no longer the dreamy, mystical city Welch and his friends had discovered in 1990 as it emerged from the Cold War. The looseness of those post-Velvet Revolution days was fading, and the city was completing its transition from Soviet bloc outpost to Western destination. The Czechs were cashing in, hustlers now outnumbered hipsters, and the market was swallowing those, like Prognosis, who didn’t cut it.
Back home in the United States, Ken Layne, a former Prognosis writer, read Welch’s farewell column. The piece, he told me in 1995, “just shows Welch playing his favourite role: the bumbling can’t-get-my-shit-together-but-I-mean-well loser. … He refuses to take real responsibility for stuff falling apart. Prognosis failed because the founders had no interest or experience in running a successful business—and that’s what a newspaper is: a business. They thought business was bad and success was evil.”
ACROSS THE TABLE at U Vejvodů, Doug Arellanes, a former art director at the paper, pulled out an old letter. In 1990 Welch and two other founders — campus paper colleagues from the University of California at Santa Barbara — wrote to Arellanes from Prague. They shared the excitement of an idea: to launch an English-language newspaper in the Czech capital. “The key to all this I think is tapping as many good people as we can,” Christopher Scheer wrote in that letter, “not running this like a business but like a movement.” He would later explain: “No one starts a business with basically no money. We did. Lacking money, we damn well better have some love and elbow grease to carry us through. We were somewhat fatalistic, also, realizing that any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success.”
Welch had arrived in Eastern Europe that August to write a novel. When the other Americans who made up the future core of Prognosis pulled into Prague at the end of disparate backpacking trips, he was away in pre-war Yugoslavia; his pals discovered he had already established a profile. “He made quite an impression on this town,” Scheer wrote to Arellanes. “Women strewn in his wake, fans rumour-mongering about his eternally imminent return … It’s like Jesus!”
Anyone who met Matt Welch understood why. His long, blond hair, piercing dark eyes and affable demeanour often made him the center of attention. In Prague, he took to playing guitar for passers-by and spare change on the city’s postcard-perfect 700-year-old Charles Bridge. Back home in California, he had worked alongside the other Prognosis founders at the Daily Nexus, the University of California at Santa Barbara student paper, composing its weather forecasts as beat poetry. “He drank enormously, liked to wear dresses to work once a week and otherwise tried to create a mythos about himself,” Scheer would remember.
There was no shortage of talent among the founders of Prognosis, but Welch seemed to be the catalyst. He was “incredibly skilled at assembling myriad people to make his daydreams come to life,” according to Ken Layne. “I once told Matt the reason he’d never finish [writing] a book of fiction is because he’s too goddamn busy living a book of fiction.” If his life was, as he told it, going nowhere until he reached Prague, then the city offered the ideal setting for his apotheosis.
BESIDES THE STUNNING architecture, a rich cultural tradition, and women with beautiful Slavic eyes, Prague had Václav Havel. Czechoslovakia’s president knew about rising from despair to an exalted position. Havel, a playwright, had been jailed as a dissident by the Communists before the Velvet Revolution of November 1989 transformed him into head of state. He remained an idealist who talked of “living in truth” and building a civic society; for young Americans disenchanted with the Republicanism of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Havel added to Prague’s appeal. “My God, this is what politics should be,” John Allison, an early expat arrival, would remember thinking after seeing Havel’s February 1990 speech to the U.S. Congress. “This is my calling.” By the end of the year, Allison found himself working as the “American advisor” to Prague’s mayor.
Havel “did sort of underline the uniqueness of the place and time,” Christopher Scheer remembered. “He sort of encapsulated it. But he wasn’t the whole story, just a symptom, because every Czech we met seemed to have a wild story, to be oddly humble and intellectual at the same time. That’s why Havel could be president—because he represented a powerful strain in Czech culture.”
Welch came to idolize this rumpled philosopher-king who, indirectly, had made Prognosis possible. In his cramped apartment in an industrial section of Prague, a large poster of Havel occupied a place of honour on one wall. Someone had used a cigarette to burn out the eyes on another poster, of Václav Klaus, Czechoslovakia’s Thatcherite finance minister. You can deface anything on the walls, Welch once told a group of guests, except the Havel poster.
Besides Welch and Scheer, the other Americans who gathered at a pub in Prague in November 1990 to hash out the newspaper idea were Ben Sullivan, Laura Pitter, Jenny Ogar, and Lisa Frankenberg. They were all staying with Czech students Welch had befriended. “The next morning, we woke up hungover and had to decide if it was all just a beery fantasy,” Scheer recalled. “We decided tentatively that it wasn’t.”
The next evening, sober, they sat down and figured out how much money they could pool for the launch. Travellers’ cheques, credit card advances and anything they could sell were all put on the table. Everyone anted up except Lisa Frankenberg.
IN WELCH’S PROGNOSIS narrative, Lisa Frankenberg became the villain. Even in those early days, Scheer and others had doubts about Frankenberg, who had worked at the Nexus before leaving to get involved in the UCSB student government. Her unwillingness to put up money made them question her commitment to their Prague newspaper, but Welch, a friend, defended her. “She was not at all like our vibe,” Welch says. “We were pretty hippie and idealistic and journalism-based and easy to get along with. She was considerably more abrasive.” But he argued that “we need different types of personalities here, particularly on the business side, and maybe we can convert those negative characteristics into something we need.”
Today, the first few issues of the monthly Prognosis look amateurish, with unattractive fonts, awkward layout, and collegiate earnestness. But they were fresh and lively, and in the spring of 1991, with Prague’s expatriate population swelling, and thousands of English-speaking tourists on the way, they represented a triumph. The founders, their meager start-up funds supplemented with money from “investors” — a few well-heeled family friends back home — had waded through layers of left-over Communist bureaucracy just to launch the paper. The first edition, “zero issue,” was snapped up by expats and backpackers starved for something to read in English. The paper would go on to chronicle everything from the sweeping privatization of state institutions, to the growth of the drug trade and prostitution, to the establishment of an Andy Warhol Museum in the Slovak village where the artist’s mother was born. “We wanted to create something that had never existed, in a place where it was impossible to imagine such a thing existing,” Welch says.
Frankenberg soon began to have doubts. In charge of distribution and advertising, she heard the same comments over and over when she tried to sell subscriptions and ad space to the growing foreign business community. Prognosis was fun, but her prospective clients wanted serious business news to help them understand this lucrative new market. They also wanted it fast: a monthly paper didn’t provide immediacy in a quickly changing economy. And the sometimes arch, collegiate tone of the paper turned them off.
In an interview in 1995, Frankenberg described how no one at Prognosis seemed concerned about what she was hearing. “The attitude was, ‘We’re having fun, we’re enjoying this, why should we change?’” she told me. There was no business plan for growth, and no budget forecasting revenues and expenses. “Very clearly, the response [from the others] was, ‘We’re not a business, we’re a newspaper.’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute, a newspaper is a business.’”
Frankenberg’s worries were compounded the day Alan Levy visited the Prognosis office to offer his services. Levy, a 59-year-old American journalist, had covered the Prague Spring, Alexander Dubček’s 1968 attempt to democratize Communism from within. When Soviet tanks arrived to crush Dubček’s experiment, Levy was expelled. He lived in Vienna for 21 years, moving back shortly after the Velvet Revolution, and his book about 1968, So Many Heroes, became a must-read for expats. He proposed writing a column for Prognosis, a series of profiles of interesting Czechs and expatriates.
The founders turned him down. “We didn’t want to publish an archetypal expat-freelancer just because he had ‘clips,’” Welch later wrote. “I wasn’t at that fateful meeting, but apparently he came on strong and condescending, and I’m sure we were more than just a little defensive about people questioning our credentials and telling us what we should cover. So with those prejudices, we read his stuff and thought it wouldn’t fit into our Mission-from-God approach.”
Welch came to see it as a defining moment for the young paper: “We finally had confidence enough in what we were to reject an over-qualified representative of what we didn’t want to be,” Welch said. Frankenberg would later call her Prognosis colleagues “callow” for not hiring Levy. “I was flabbergasted that anyone would turn away such a gifted writer and I expressed my apologies to Alan,” she wrote years later. Frankenberg was now so frustrated that she considered packing it in and resuming her studies back in the States in the fall.
But in July 1991, a newspaper distributor working for Frankenberg had a chance meeting with a Texas businessman, Monroe Luther, who was in Prague inking deals. Luther told Frankenberg he might invest in Prognosis, but he wanted his money put to good use: he wanted a more business-oriented weekly, and suggested she come back with him in two days with a proposal to transform the paper.
According to Matt Welch and Christopher Scheer, Frankenberg and her philosophical soulmate in the Prognosis business office, Kent Hawryluk, demanded a radical change of editorial direction—more serious and business-friendly—without mentioning Luther’s possible infusion of cash. (Frankenberg disputed this account when I interviewed her in 1995, saying she was upfront about Luther’s investment offer and that the desire for a revamp came from him.) Frankenberg and Hawryluk also wanted to be equal partners in the business, a status denied to them because they had invested no money. Otherwise, they said, they’d walk. “Man, were we agonized,” Welch says. “We definitely needed them, and they did stuff we couldn’t imagine doing ourselves, but there was something pretty gross and not trustworthy about playing ultimatum games with an idealistic venture started by people of good faith. So ultimately, we said no.”
A few days later, Frankenberg and Hawryluk resigned from Prognosis and persuaded Luther to use his money to help them launch a business-oriented weekly called The Prague Post. It hit the streets in October, 1991, its early issues were hopelessly dull in design, style and content. But the paper knew how to sell itself: the Post played to the business community with credulous coverage of finance and investment, and bought prime space on billboards, branding itself a serious player in the marketplace and selling a lot of advertising. “Their initial billboards cost more than we spent in the first nine months of our entire operation,” Scheer recalled.
Alan Levy was hired as titular editor-in-chief of The Prague Post. “We are living in the Left Bank of the ’90s,” he declared in a column in the inaugural issue, alluding to Hemingway’s Paris. “For some of us, Prague is Second Chance City; for others a new frontier where anything goes, everything goes, and, often enough, nothing works. Yesterday is long gone, today is nebulous, and who knows about tomorrow, but, somewhere within each of us, we all know that we are living in a historic place at a historic time.”
The Prognosis founders were hardly jealous of the Post’s content—they rolled their eyes at Levy’s prose, and they wouldn’t miss Frankenberg and Hawryluk—but the pair took their advertising and distribution contacts with them. Suddenly, Prognosis was without a business staff, and without the network the pair had assembled to sell the newspaper in an often-baffling post-Communist environment. “It was like a jackhammer in the nuts,” Welch says. “It totally drained the joy out of the situation.”
Welch, Scheer, and the others responded by taking Prognosis biweekly and working even harder. “We did not, however, try to beat the Post at their own game,” Scheer said. “Arrogant or not, we decided very consciously to keep trying to put out the newspaper that we wanted to put out and not just try to be a local version of The Wall Street Journal.”
THEY STILL HAD HYPE on their side. For foreign reporters dropping in on Prague to profile the growing expat community, the grimy, cluttered Prognosis office was an essential stop. The paper represented the kind of journalism they secretly wanted to practice: fun, smart, brashly principled. Any feature piece on the self-exiled, twentysomethings of Prague inevitably included the same tropes: the American-owned New York Pizza restaurant; the mayor’s “American advisor,” John Allison, who had moved onto a job in Havel’s office in the majestic Castle overlooking the city; Laundry Kings, the American-owned, first-ever self-serve laundromat in Prague—and Prognosis. “It’s practically impossible to live here for any length of time and not be interviewed by some major paper or broadcast network, adding another level of absurdity to what is already a pretty ridiculous existence,” Welch would write. “All this silliness has not exactly hurt our paper, my career or my swelling ego needs.”
In July 1992 Welch was the central character in a lengthy article in Details magazine that many expats credited with single-handedly spinning the Prague hype-meter into the stratosphere. Using Prognosis as a framing device, writer Henry Copeland portrayed Prague as a hedonistic haven for a new lost generation. Welch and others would mock the article, particularly a quotation uttered by one Prognosis writer: “In Prague, everything is so open that you can re-invent yourself every day.” Yet a copy of that issue, preserved like new, was tucked away in Welch’s flat, where I discovered it during the two months I spent subletting his place.
In retrospect, that Details piece represented the high-water mark for expatriate Prague. The same summer it was published, reality began to intrude on the fairy tale: Czechoslovakia’s first full-scale elections, in June 1992 produced a political schism in the federation. Václav Klaus, leader of the Civic Democratic Party, triumphed in the Czech parliament, while the victory of a pro-independence party in Slovakia threatened to split the country. Klaus, a bottom-line man in favour of rapid privatization and economic restructuring, had no qualms about saying goodbye to the Slovaks: the poorer, slower-to-modernize, more rural part of the federation was a drag on his ideological plans. As president, Václav Havel sought to preserve the federation because of the multi-ethnic ideal it represented, but even Havel’s moral authority could not contain the forces that had been unleashed. On New Year’s Day, 1993, Czechoslovakia, the country that had survived Nazism and Communism, the two great totalitarian plagues of the twentieth century, ceased to exist.
Havel was soon chosen as president of the new Czech Republic and Klaus became its prime minister. Prognosis would call them “those wild and warring poster boys of the modern Czech soul.” Klaus, the no-nonsense, get-things-done manager in a hurry to downsize the machinery of government, was the efficient administrator, while Havel, the philosopher and moralist, was perfect for the role of symbolic head of state. They would clash repeatedly: Havel felt Klaus forgot the human element in governing; Klaus found Havel’s dreamy idealism impractical. “The advocate of non-political politics met a consummate political animal,” Havel’s biographer later wrote.
The schism echoed Prague’s expat newspaper war: Prognosis, though struggling financially, continued to strive for a journalistic ideal akin to Havel’s “living in truth” as it chronicled the changes in Czech society. The Post, Klaus-like in its pragmatism, prospered by playing to the market, giving the big-spending expat business community what it wanted. Prognosis was still cooler, but like Havel, it was no longer invincible.
THE DETAILS STORY drew me to Prague as I fled a recession-wracked newspaper industry in Canada. But by the time I arrived in January 1993, the city was re-inventing itself so quickly that it was no longer the Capital of Dreams sketched by the magazine just six months earlier. The cost of two expat staples, beer and apartment rent, both ridiculously cheap by U.S. standards in early 1992, were creeping up as the market adjusted to the city’s destination status. The talk now was less about Havel, the playwright president, and more about Klaus, the economic guru whose reforms were seen as a textbook example of how to move from Communism to capitalism.
Visiting reporters had also discovered a new source of expat wisdom. They now often visited the offices of The Prague Post to interview Lisa Frankenberg. Across town at Prognosis, meanwhile, the founders, exhausted by the grind of publishing and the battle with the Post, turned over senior editorial positions to newcomers and moved into writing positions, or onto new adventures. Welch relocated to Bratislava, the capital of newly independent Slovakia, to run the paper’s bureau there, while the new managers grappled with how to give the operation some much-needed stability.
The new publisher, Erica Breth, discovered there was still no real budget, business plan, or bookkeeping. (Scheer, when I interviewed him in 1995, disputed the idea that the founders had ignored the business side; they “worried enormously” about it, he said, but “none of it made our business sense any more acute, none of it made us more organized, none of it brought us big investors.”) More money from “investors” back in the U.S., including wealthy liberal philanthropist Helen Bing, couldn’t erase the red ink. The journalism remained solid, and Breth and her fellow managers stayed one step ahead of invoices from printers, phone companies and other suppliers. But Prognosis was sputtering financially.
Several staff members left in the summer and fall of 1993. Some, like me, were lured by jobs back home; most feared the paper’s demise was a matter of time. On a fundraising trip to the United States, Breth made the rounds of foundations and other do-gooders who had endowed the paper in the early days. But the Czech Republic’s much-publicized economic success meant, perversely, that the novelty of a scrappy little paper in Prague was wearing off. The money Breth gathered in early 1994 was quickly used, all at once, to pay off the paper’s printers, who hadn’t collected for months and were refusing to roll the presses.
Matt Welch wouldn’t give in. He left the bureau in Bratislava and returned to Prague, where he and Ben Sullivan, another founder, stepped back into senior editorial jobs under John Allison, who became editor-in-chief. “I still recall that the engine that was the news desk was being fueled almost single-handedly by Matt and John Allison, who both toiled mightily to put out a newspaper,” reporter Logan Mabe would say.
Welch was still making myths: Prognosis could rise again. In May, 1994, a Dutch businessman, Harmen Smink, injected cash by buying 51 per cent of the paper. Welch contacted a handful of Prognosis alumni in California, among them Ken Layne, and appealed to them to return to Prague. “He had these various godlike attributes attached to each of us,” Layne told me in 1995, “and he figured he could just play God and assemble a new group of ‘founders’ that would continue the legacy, as it were, and maybe put some fire and guts back into it.” Others were wary, but Layne accepted an offer to become editor-in-chief—until he learned at the last minute that he would not have the authority Welch had promised him. He was tempted, he said, to fly to Prague “just to beat the shit out of Matt and leave him for dead with his fucking guitar rammed up his hippy ass.” In Layne’s place, Charlie Hornberger, a Nexus pal of Welch, took over.
Smink’s money allowed Prognosis to move into better offices and go weekly with full-colour covers. Newsstand sales jumped, but advertising did not. Within a few weeks the problems began anew: Smink’s hard currency seemed to be evaporating. It would later emerge that the paper’s business manager was defrauding the paper, funneling money into her own private ventures. By the time anyone noticed, it was too late.
The newspaper’s philosophical guru up in Prague Castle was in no better state. As his popularity plummeted, Václav Havel mused to one interviewer about how he looked forward to leaving the presidency and becoming a simple pensioner. The economy, not ethics and morals, drove the agenda in Prague, and Prime Minister Václav Klaus was the man of the moment. He had a budget surplus forecast for 1995, the lowest inflation rate in the former Soviet bloc, and a jobless rate below four per cent. At the end of 1994, Klaus mocked Havel’s idea of the president delivering a “State of the Nation” address to Parliament — then delivered one himself. Poll after poll showed Czechs considered Havel the more principled of the two men, but they trusted Klaus to run the country.
On New Years’ Day, 1995, Klaus gave a look-ahead interview to the country’s first private TV station, Nova. In a clear attempt to eclipse the president, it was broadcast at the same time as Havel’s New Year’s address on state television. Of Havel’s remarks, Prognosis reported: “Far from an optimist in his days of waning popularity and influence, Havel could apparently muster only the dark conclusion that ‘Not everything is lost yet.’”
The president might as well have been talking about the expat newspaper inspired by his idealism. As the financial situation worsened, Welch accepted a job at the Budapest Business Journal. Smink tried to buy out the remaining 49 per cent of the paper still owned by Welch and the founders; when they balked, he cut off salaries and shopped his controlling shares to potential buyers, including The Prague Post. A gossip column in the February 21 issue of Prognosis ended prophetically with a comment that “all things come to an end sometime.” The following week, the founders decided to maintain their paper’s dignity. They closed it down.
MATT WELCH SAT down with a bottle of wine at his desk in Budapest at the end of February 1995 and wrote a piece for the final issue of Prognosis that would be headlined “A Long Goodbye to the Paper I Loved Best.”
“We were right all along,” Welch wrote, “if excessively stupid and self-indulgent in the deployment.” He expressed pride in the legacy Prognosis would leave—in particular the journalism education it gave to many young Czechs and Slovak interpreters and translators who became talented reporters for local media organizations—but he also mourned: this was the piece in which he declared that “the tangible source of [his] life is now dead,” tying his own fate to that of the daydream he would soon bury. “What I was expressing there,” he says now, “was a kind of gratitude for having been able to experience something that made me at least quasi-presentable to the world of journalism, and a melancholy for that beautiful and helpful thing being dead.”
Lisa Frankenberg told me she felt no sense of triumph at the demise of Prognosis, even though it gave her Prague Post a freer hand in Prague’s English-language media market. She claimed to be moved by Welch’s coda. “There were probably only a handful of people who read that through to the end. I read it. I read it to the very end,” she said. Winning the expat newspaper war was “very weird and sad. It was a very weird day. We knew it was coming for a long time.”
One night in May 1995, as the spring air brought with it the promise of another beautiful summer in Prague, Frankenberg took a stroll on the Charles Bridge with Monroe Luther, the owner of the Post. They talked about the paper’s prospects: its circulation was rising, and a growing number of English-speaking Czechs read it. “It’s a successful business,” Frankenberg told me at the time, though she refused to reveal if it was profitable.
Suddenly Frankenberg saw a familiar figure with a guitar, blond hair waving in the breeze as he strummed on the bridge. “Hey, Matt!” she yelled. He smiled, answered, “Hey, Frankenberg.” Matt Welch was back in town, and could still muster a smile for his former rival.
Frankenberg and Luther kept walking. “Someday in the future, I’d like to sit down with him and have a coffee or a beer and talk things out,” she told me in 1995. “But it takes time. It was probably like part of him dying when Prognosis died.”
They never had that coffee. Welch eventually returned to the United States, where, he says, he parlayed what he called the “quasi-presentable” reputation he earned in Prague into a career in journalism. The Prague Post continues to publish digitally, though it shed its print edition in 2013. Welch says he holds no grudge against Frankenberg. “Why? Competition’s good, man! It made both papers better. And because I, unlike her, can look at myself in the mirror every night before going to sleep without so much as a twinge of doubt of how I comported myself professionally in my early twenties. She won the battle, for which she deserves real credit. But history will not remember her paper nearly the same way, and that just makes me smile and smile.”
IN 1995, MANY Prognosis staffers and alumni were less sanguine. True, the city had become faster, harder, more expensive and less forgiving: the free market that had made Prognosis possible had killed it. But it was tempting to conclude Welch and the others had squandered what they had built—a newspaper that everyone who worked there had come to consider their own.
“These American kids start the first English-language newspaper. … It can’t help but thrive, right?” Welch’s friend, Ken Layne, told me in an e-mail in 1995. “It sputters along for several years, getting a million dollars in free press, no business plan, no financial plan, no discipline, just bumbling along, just like all of Prague is doing. And just like the fucking Communists, Prognosis is living off subsidies,” a reference to the money from relatives and foundations in the United States. “Meanwhile, the Czechs figure it all out. They toss away a lifetime of anti-capitalist bullshit and turn Prague into a fucking money machine. Everybody figures out how to run a business, how to make cash, how to succeed — everybody but these American kids who refuse to even acknowledge the need for money, for success.
“If Lisa Frankenberg is your villain,” Layne added, “you’ve bought into the biggest piece of fabricated history ever. If they had figured out how to use Lisa’s smarts … Prognosis would be a thriving media empire today instead of a dead newspaper fondly remembered by fifty people. The results speak for themselves. Lisa is no monster. A hundred other people have felt the same way about the half-ass manner in which Prognosis was run.”
When I remind Layne of those comments almost two decades later, he explains that “one of my habits of my youth was to get good and drunk and pissed off while typing. It was, I guess, my literary style of the era.” In 1995, he says, he was still bitter about his aborted return to Prague. “I was supposed to be editor of a paper I loved in the Czech Republic, and instead I was drifting around.”
Layne still doesn’t blame Frankenberg for the paper’s demise: she left in 1991, and the paper took another four years to fold, he points out, plenty of time to have turned things around. But he is more forgiving of Welch and company. “While I’ve lost touch with all but a dozen or so of the Prognosis gang, those dozen people remain some of my best friends,” he says. “The group of Californians and Czechs who started up that paper did a pretty good job with intolerable circumstances.” Even in 1995, at his most frustrated, Layne said of them, “they are good people, and that Prague experience remains incredibly significant. It reverberates through every part of my life.”
CHRISTOPHER SCHEER’S FATHER, journalist Robert Scheer, urged the Prognosis founders in 1994 “to just become an Internet newspaper,” Welch says, “which would have been way ahead of the curve.” Instead, because the paper died at almost the precise moment the Internet became a mass phenomenon, there is no online archive or digital database of its five-year run. Former employees now speak of a complete set of printed issues the way one recounts an urban legend: the full run is always sitting in the basement of the friend of a friend, just out of reach. So Prognosis, as an iteration of young, earnest, idealistic journalism, cannot be considered in its entirety, but only in pieces. A virtual collection of yellowed issues lies scattered across the globe, a notional scrapbook of clippings, impressions, half-memories and fading photographs.
In the twenty years since its demise, my picture of Prognosis has evolved from a lost opportunity into something else. As a bit player, I too was frustrated to see it fold. Today, I no longer imagine an alternate history in which Prognosis survived the nineties: I just marvel at the audacity of its brief, improbable existence. During one gloomy period in 1993, Christopher Scheer wrote in a memo to the staff that the paper was not “a normal institution. … Stability is not its primary, overriding goal. Those who seem to wish Prognosis was some great gleaming ship of stable corporate love — including myself at many an exhausted moment — would not want to work at such a place.” The founders of Prognosis gave us a life-changing experience; they didn’t owe us permanence.
Any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success, Scheer had said. And so the sharp edges of the picture soften to something else: a moment, ephemeral but real, in the dusty swirl of post-1989 Central Europe. Lyle Zimskind, a managing editor of the Czech edition of Esquire, would remember Prognosis as “chaotically managed” but “livelier” than the Post — a victory by any measure, except that of for-profit survival.
In his 1990 letter, Scheer had advocated “not running this like a business but like a movement.” And every movement runs its course. Welch made not only his daydreams come to life, but those of every other expat who saw their work — their words, their whimsy, their passion — on those pages. “Prognosis was an expression of pure newspaper romanticism,” he says. “The whole thing was an expression of love for the form.”
“The paper failed,” writer Logan Mabe would conclude, “but it wasn’t a failure.”
IN LATE 2011, Welch, now the editor-in-chief of Reason, a Washington libertarian magazine, returned to Prague to attend the funeral of his idol, Václav Havel. Havel’s English translator, Paul Wilson, had secured him a seat inside St. Vitus Cathedral, the imposing Gothic structure at Prague Castle that dominates the city skyline.
Outside the gates, hundreds of thousands normally taciturn Czechs were mourning their hero. They were part of the West now, part of the European Union and of NATO, and though Havel’s popularity had faded before he left the presidency in 2003, his reputation for principle was intact — unlike that of his rival, Klaus, whose government was eventually tainted by corruption scandals. And so, though the end of Communism had produced many complications and disappointments, the citizens of Prague crowded the streets for Havel’s funeral procession, wrapping the city in the same atmosphere of possibility they created in 1989.
In a piece for Reason’s website, Welch reflected on what Havel had inspired, not in Welch himself, but in the Czech capital. “From the Velvet Revolution through at least 1991, and in many (though lesser) respects for years after, Prague was alive with rediscovery and experimentation in the exciting, difficult, anarchic interlude between Communism and its built-out replacement,” he wrote. “More than mere nostalgia for a limited era of time (one I was fortunate enough to participate in), that same spirit of, well, love, or at least its handmaiden decency, has never really gone away.”
The newspaper was never far from Welch’s mind during his quick return to Prague. “That forty-eight hours I spent there was a profound moment, one I absolutely lived up to by drinking until 5 a.m. the night before the funeral with a bunch of ex-Prognosis comrades, and then vomiting inside the castle after the religious ceremony, and also, again, under the Charles Bridge on the walk back,” he told me. “Friends from New York told me to do it right, in their honor, and so I did.”
“Prague is beautiful like an insecure woman,” Prognosis staffer Kate Sullivan once wrote. “It doesn’t seem to realize the crazy extent of its beauty; it doesn’t notice the effect it has on people.” But everyone who ever worked at the paper realized it. They still do.
“To this day,” Welch says, “I reject the term ‘the real world,’ because my feeling is that we should all strive for the surrealism that we were able to enjoy in early-nineties Prague.”

Disclaimer: This whole article was written under the optics of a budget traveler. If you are a deep-pocketed luxury jet-setter and frequent guest of Ritz, chances are your perceptions are completely different.
In this article, I will list 3 reasons why Prague disappointed me, so you can avoid it.
Prague is one of the most visited cities in Europe. With 8.8 million tourists per year, it receives more visitors than entire countries like Tunisia or Brazil (8.3 and 6.6 million respectively).
The Czech capital is known for its good beer and cheap costs. Especially for young tourists.
While they surely produce some great Pilsen (beer type named after the Czech city of Plzeň), I dispute the idea that Prague is a bargain, based in the 3 points below.
The hype made scammers flourish in the city. Unless you developed some serious budget-traveling skills (you can get some in my last book), you risk being ripped off on a weekend.
The old town of Prague is full of scams that are rare in eastern or central European capitals like Warsaw. Talking about comparisons, in my experience, the cost-benefit of visiting Prague is far worse than other…

Our experiences traveling through Prague
Prague is the complete opposite of Berlin. While Berlin is modern and hip, Prague still maintains its old town charms and traditional values. At first glance, Prague appears to be frozen in time thanks to its beautiful old buildings, castles and town squares that have survived the past few world wars.
However, after delving deeper into the city we soon realised that the entire Old Town and Castle Quarter were populated by tourists. Most locals in these areas were people working in the tourism industry and shop retailers. I have mixed feelings about Prague. I may be slightly biased by the fact that we both fell ill for two whole days in Prague, but mostly I think it’s because unlike Berlin, we didn't really get to experience a lot (if any) of the local scenes in Prague.
CONS:
PROS:
Having visited 4 countries already as I write this, Prague stands out as the most distinct and beautiful old city. The Old Town (Stare Mesto)is the centerpiece of Prague, intact with beautiful heritage buildings exudes an air of romance at nightfall when the orange hued street lamps lights up the streets of Old Town. Walking around Old Town Square in the evening felt abit like being in a fairytale.
Also for the opera and theatre fans, the tickets to a show were very reasonable (approx 10–15euros) compared to Vienna. We didn’t manage to catch a show, however reading online it would appear that Prague offers a good and cheaper alternative for classical music plays.
Castle Quarter (Hradcany) is a Unesco heritage site known for Prague Castle located in this area and the surrounding sights which are packed with Czech history. Castle Quarter dominates the skyline of Prague as it is located on a hill on the other side of River Vltava. Aside from the multitude of historical museums, cathedral and castle buildings to visit, Castle Quarter also offers the best vantage point for photography. Get yourself a combi ticket at Prague Castle to get the most out of your visit. Some of the notable mentions were captured in the photos below.
Unfortunately our appetites have shrunk in Prague. As mentioned earlier, we fell sick and were homebound for two whole days out of our week long duration in Prague. That could be the cause of our lack of foodie finds, but generally Prague didn’t impress us much in the food aspect. The foodie scene was not as evolved as its neighbouring cities, so fusion or international cuisines were not as plentiful. Their traditional meals are generally meat and potatoes with not much greens on the plate. I’m all for trying new food and traditional cuisines, but I can now conclude that Prague’s traditional fares are just not for me.

A few weeks ago, I visited Prague and stayed there for five nights. It was my third visit to this capital city. This time, I came to this magnificent place not as a tourist but as a job seeker. Of course, as a non-Czech-speaking social scientist, it was indeed unrealistic and naive to think that I could land something here. The expected delusion and frustration tainted my views on the things surrounding me; all the people (especially the tourist gangs) appeared so annoying that I was unable to enjoy my stay.
With that being said, I still walked around and tried to catch up with some good old friends. Of course, the one and only Charles Bridge was a “must-revisit.”
I also revisited the “ugly corner” of Prague that I had my first encounter with during the early outbreak of the pandemic. I use quotation marks here because it can be a precious gem if you are into alternative urban landscapes. Anyway, I did not intend to see it again. But the apartment of the couchsurfing host, who accommodated me for the first three nights, was just a dozen meters away. It indeed reminded me of the days when people were annoyed by the unknown virus.

My brother and I decided to establish the headquarters of our tech company in Prague. It was the best decision we’ve ever made.
People who have visited Prague before can confirm that it’s an astonishing city with impressively clean streets, stunning architecture, diverse cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife. But most people are only now starting to realize that Prague is also a hidden gem for tech companies.
To understand why Prague is just starting to flourish, you have to look back more than 100 years and understand a bit of Czech history.
Throughout its history, the Czech Republic has always been a prominent economic player in Europe. In the early 20th century, it was actually an industrial powerhouse and held 10th place in the world industrial production. It was only after World War 2 when the Czech Republic became occupied by the Soviet Union and then ruled by communism, that its economy started to halter.
However, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully ended communism, the Czech Republic reestablished democracy and a market economy. Since then (over the last 30 years) the Czech economy has been growing at an impressive pace and it now proudly produces the most GDP per capita in comparison to all other post-communist countries.
Prague also has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, at just 1.3%.
Looking back at the last 30 years and seeing how much progress the Czech Republic has made leaves me and everybody living in Prague excited about the future.
The Czech Republic boasts a great education system.
I myself spent a few years in the Czech Republic during high school and can confirm it from first-hand experiences. When I was transferring over from my school in the US, I had to spend the whole summer catching up on algebra, physics, and chemistry just so that I could join the same age students and didn’t have to stay a year back.
Getting a university education in the Czech Republic is free, which gives the opportunity for everyone to enroll and lifts the education level across the whole population. The free education system also attracts many foreign students who wouldn’t have been able to afford an education at home.
Czech universities also have very high-quality computer science and mathematics programs, which serves as a solid foundation for future software engineers. The mathematics programs are especially key for those students who later on pursue careers in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
HackerRank, a California-based service that runs tests for software engineers, ranked Czech engineers 2nd in the world in mathematical challenges which reflect their skill in functional programming.
The Czech engineers ranked 9th in the world overall. The US ranked 13th.
If you’re reading this article and you’re sitting in a large US metropolitan area, you’re probably used to long commute times and have just accepted traffic as part of your life, as I did when I was living in the Bay Area. Prague doesn’t have this issue.
Its public transport system is ranked 5th in the world and is used by over two thirds of the city’s population. It has an affordable, yet sophisticated train, metro, tram and bus system, allowing you to comfortably get around the city within minutes.
Prague is located in the heart of Europe and has direct flight connections to all other major European cities such as Paris, London, or Amsterdam. Flight times are all under 2h and usually cost between $50 — $250 round trip.
Prague is gradually becoming a global metropolis and is catching up to cities like Paris and Amsterdam, however, it is still incomparable when it comes to prices and is, therefore, a great place to work and live. You can afford to live a high standard of life with an average Prague salary, especially if you’re working in tech.
I ran a price comparison of San Francisco vs. Prague (my two hometowns) and this is where we’ve landed (1):
It’s also tough to get bored in Prague. It’s an energetic city with endless cool events to attend. If you’re into contemporary art exhibits, prosecco festivals, local food markets, underground techno raves, or just into chilling in the park enjoying the castle view, you’ve got it.
Over recent years, Prague has attracted a lot of foreigners and now has a thriving expat community, which makes up more than 25% of Prague’s workforce. Plenty of Americans and Brits have decided to move here as well and surprisingly in some districts you now hear English on the streets and at cafes more often than Czech.
We’re witnessing the Prague startup scene flourish.
Just over the past few months, we’ve seen Prague startup productboard raise a $45,000,000 Series B round led by Sequoia Capital, Twisto, an emerging fintech startup raise $15,000,000 and Rossum, a startup extracting data from invoices and documents using machine learning, raise $4,500,000.
If you’re just launching your tech startup and are having trouble with hiring the right technical talent, or are shocked by the high prices and burn rate you’ll have in an oversaturated tech hub like Silicon Valley, you might want to consider making Prague your new home.
Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I’ll be happy to give you tips and tricks for Prague. I’ve been here for almost 4 years and moving here was the best decision I’ve made.

PRAGUE
The City of a Hundred Spires: My Unforgettable Journey to Prague
As I stepped off the train at Prague’s main station, the crisp Czech air hit me like a slap in the face, jolting me awake from the long journey. I had dreamed of visiting this enchanting city for years, and finally, here I was, ready to immerse myself in its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant culture. Little did I know, Prague had a way of weaving itself into the fabric of my soul, leaving an indelible mark that would stay with me forever.
My journey began on a chilly autumn morning, as I wandered through the winding streets of the Old Town, taking in the breathtaking views of the city’s iconic landmarks. The Charles Bridge, with its 30 statues of saints, stretched majestically across the Vltava River, while the majestic St. Vitus Cathedral pierced the sky like a shard of glass. Every step revealed a new treasure: a quaint café, a street performer, or a hidden alleyway that seemed to whisper secrets of the past.
As I explored the city, I stumbled upon a small, family-owned bakery, tucked away in a quiet corner of the Jewish Quarter. The aroma of freshly baked trdelník wafted out, enticing me to enter. Inside, I found a cozy haven, filled with the warmth of traditional Czech hospitality. The owner, a kind-eyed woman named Marie, offered me a taste of her famous pastry, and as I bit into the sweet, flaky treat, I felt a deep connection to the city and its people.
Prague, it seemed, was a city of layers, each one revealing a new story, a new secret, or a new surprise. As I delved deeper, I discovered the city’s complex history, marked by periods of grandeur and turmoil. I visited the Prague Castle, a sprawling complex of palaces, churches, and gardens, which had witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the birth of new ideas, and the struggles of a nation. The castle’s grandeur was humbling, yet, as I walked through its empty corridors, I felt a sense of intimacy, as if the stones themselves were sharing their stories with me.
One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, I found myself at a traditional Czech pub, surrounded by locals and travelers alike. The air was thick with the smell of roasted meat and freshly brewed beer, and the sound of laughter and music filled the room. I struck up a conversation with a young Czech musician, named Jakub, who shared with me the city’s vibrant arts scene, from classical music to contemporary theater. As we talked, I realized that Prague was not just a city; it was a living, breathing entity, pulsing with creativity and energy.
As the days passed, I fell deeper in love with Prague. I wandered through the city’s many parks and gardens, each one a tranquil oasis in the midst of the bustling metropolis. I visited the famous John Lennon Wall, now a symbol of peace and freedom, where I added my own message to the thousands of words and images that covered the wall. And I marveled at the city’s stunning architecture, a blend of Gothic, Renaissance, and Art Nouveau styles, which seemed to defy gravity and push the boundaries of human creativity.
But Prague was not just a city of grand monuments and historic landmarks; it was also a city of quiet moments, of intimate connections, and of personal discoveries. As I sat in a small café, watching the snowflakes fall gently outside, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. It was as if the city had wrapped its arms around me, holding me close, and whispering words of comfort and reassurance.
As I prepared to leave Prague, I felt a pang of sadness, knowing that I would soon be leaving behind this enchanting city and its people. But I also knew that a part of me would remain, forever connected to the city’s spirit, its energy, and its beauty. Prague had taught me that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, there is always beauty to be found, always a story to be told, and always a connection to be made.
As I boarded the train to leave, I glanced out the window, watching as the city’s spires and towers disappeared into the distance. I smiled, knowing that I would return, that I would once again wander the streets of Prague, and that I would continue to uncover the secrets and stories that this incredible city had to offer. For in Prague, I had discovered a part of myself, a part that I never knew existed, and a part that I would carry with me for the rest of my life.

Last summer, when the spring lockdown temporarily lifted, we engaged in a bit of an ‘empty Prague tourism.’ It’s surprising how little I get to see the city’s historical parts — I mostly avoid them because they are full of tourists. Prague is wonderful (so I understand that people want to see it), and the distinctive landmarks like Charles Bridge or Old Town Square are usually packed. And so that’s where we decided to go.
We started our stroll at the beautiful Kampa island. With its maze of tiny streets and an old watermill, it’s one of my favorite places in Prague. We didn’t go as far as the famous Lennon wall, but we enjoyed the poetry booth on the edge of the park instead. This invention is one of the indigenous ideas of Ondrej Kobza, who is also behind the Prague street piano initiative and is always looking for ways to make the city more interesting. Needless to say, I am a fan.
From Kampa, we headed to the Charles Bridge. I was curious about how many people would be there — after all, we were not the only ones on the empty city sightseeing bandwagon. As it turned out, it wasn’t completely devoid of explorers like us, but there were very few people.
The Charles Bridge is usually a bustling hub of activity with its sides lined by various stalls and the space between them filled by a mass of people. You can move only at a slow pace here — together with the crowd. I have never seen it as empty as that day.
We crossed the Charles Bridge and got to the Old Town Square and its famous astronomical clock. When I was a little child, my parents sometimes took me there to see the renowned moving figurines of the twelves apostles, a display that plays out at the end of every hour. But we always had to stand on our tiptoes in the middle of the crowd to see them.
This time was different. We picked the restaurant directly across the astronomical clock, sat at an outside table, ordered lunch, and waited for the whole spectacle to begin.
I have never ever thought that I would be eating in one of the Old Town Square restaurants. Usually, they are full of tourists, and the prices are astronomical — no pun intended. Today though, the restaurant was half-empty and the prices reasonable. And the food was delicious too! I was glad to find out they served a vegetarian burger, and I can definitely recommend it. If you are interested, the name of the restaurant is El Toro Negro.
We slowly ate our lunch, and then the astronomical clock awakened, and everything suddenly set to motion. The twelve apostles moved behind the little windows, a figure of a skeleton that represents death beckoned at us with its little scythe, and the cockerel that symbolizes life ended the spectacle with its crowing. It was pretty nostalgic because I haven’t been here for a long time.
At the end of our excursion, we decided to visit the main Prague library around the corner from Old Town Square. We had a particular reason for it — in the lobby is a sculpture that I love, and Ben has never seen it before. It is a tower built from old books stretching from the floor to the ceiling. Inside of it are two mirrors that reflect the picture, so when you look inside, you see a book tunnel that stretches into eternity.
I never get tired of this sight. Ben was properly amazed. We are a pair of bookworms, so we can never pass on a sight like this. And it was a great conclusion to a well-spent day as tourists in our own city. It was a fun thing to do, and I think we will try to repeat it more often from now on, Covid or not. After all, Prague is a beautiful city, and I should realize more often how lucky I am to live here.

All by myself: Where to Get Coffee as an Introvert in Prague,https://medium.com/@katerynabasina/all-by-myself-where-to-get-coffee-as-an-introvert-in-prague-ce8fc26d205,"Sign up

It seems illogical that an introvert should love going out. And yet we do. However, we often go out for reasons contrary to why extrovert’s head to the nearest bar. It is not a journey to meet someone or get social, it is a time to engage in a solitary activity and dive into the inner world of thought, perceptions and sensations. Whenever an extrovert goes out to make a new acquaintance, an introvert will often prefer to read a book, do some writing or appreciate the multitude of tastes that his food offers him.
The Internet abounds in advice on how to dine like an introvert. Some of it is quite amusing, like:
While you may choose to follow or disregard this advice, I suggest you head to a cafe anyway. Here’s my list of cafes in Prague where you can have a decent cup of coffee and be left alone, if that’s what your heart desires.
Mama coffee
I found Mama coffee by chance. I wanted to have a look at a New Town Tower and followed the Vodičkova street heading to Vaclavske namesti. On my right I saw big steel-framed windows and cosy tables inside, so I gave it a chance. At the time I was starting to get desperate about finding decent coffee in Prague.
This place is more than simply good coffee in the city center (and believe me when I say finding good coffee is not as easy as it might seem). It has a great vibe due to the abundance of green plants, vintage furniture and photographs on the walls. It was there that my husband and I bought two framed photographs by František Beneš — a mysterious Czech photographer who voyaged across Europe and Africa and captured people and life at the turn of the century. Why is Beneš mysterious? His photo negatives have only recently been discovered and archived by another Czech photographer, Martin Wágner, but there is little information about Beneš himself.
It was in this caffee I saw a girl with Jack Russell and I had a thought that it was the very dog breed I needed. The Asian girl was sitting on a stool at a bar, slowly retracting dog biscuits from a pocket of her black jacket and feeding it to a dog who was watching her with lively and attentive eyes. The universe works in unique ways, and a day later we got Josef from a shelter, who is a mix of a Jack and a daschund, our misbehaving and beloved pup.
The café has solid desserts and very affordable house wines, so you can safely hide away in a corner with a book or with your work on a laptop.
Neustadt
Minus: they don’t serve coffee after 7 p.m. except for filtered coffee.
Plus: enchanting courtyard. If you are lucky enough you might even hear some music — there is a piano open for public to play. When the sounds fill up the courtyard, it is the most enchanting experience. The music will play its charm upon you.
Neustadt is a hipster place and rightly so. Just sit down and listen to how the voices of people around you echo from the walls of the courtyard. Look at the grapes on the adjacent wall and the little tower which will make you think a Rapunzel might actually feel quite comfortable here.
Literární kavárna Retêzova
If you find yourself in that very hellish part of town which is swarmed with tourists, you’ll crave to end up in a quiet place. Well, I’ve got you covered. Retezova street is in the very center but miraculously manages to stay crowd-free. The first time we came to Literarní kavarna was on our first visit to Prague. It was winter and in the middle of the day the place was empty. And so was it on all of my other visits. This is the perfect place to blog away, being inspired by all the black-and-white photographs of writers who used to frequent this place.
Mind you, despite the lack of people the service can be a bit slow — on the other hand, why hurry when you have all day to write that article?
Grand Café Orient
The very building in which Grand Cafe Orient is situated brings you back to an era of Czech cubism — all things pre-war, avant-garde, revolutionary and rebellious. I have never seen anything quite like it in design, and it is easy to see why Czech cubism is something the nation takes pride in — crystalline shapes and unexpected angles of ordinary objects. Its idea was to reject the secessionist architecture and yet if you look closely its aesthetic is as decorative as the style it rejected.
Paradoxically, Grand Cafe Orient on the second floor is less cubist, more art nouveau. The coffee is alright, this is definitely a place for people-watching, tourist-watching, to be precise. Yet the atmosphere lashes your imagination and it runs away like a wild steed into an era where rebelling with art was possible without the phones, but with the work full of expression.
Louvre
I didn’t want to include Louvre first because it defies my theory. At midday, it is definitely not a good place for introverts, because it’s packed with tourists. And even if you do get a place a stranger will most certainly come up and wish to sit with you. And if they sit down, they’ll most certainly engage into conversation with you. It happened to me on my last visit. An American lady, desperate for a lunch spot, sat down on the bench across from me, and as she was doing that already, I offered her to join me for lunch not to seem rude. We had a small talk about this and that — she was living in LA, came to Prague for a screenwriting and poetry workshop — don’t get me wrong, I love meeting artistic people, but it was not what I came to the cafe for. I came to dive into my own inner world, remember?
And yet I could not make a list of my favourite cafes and not include this one. There’s something absolutely tantalising in dining at the same table as Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Karel Čapek and Albert Einstein could have dined. They could have been writing letters, having philosophical readings or using these tables as a temporary office. That link to a different epoch amazes me and makes me fantasise: how different did life feel at that time? Did it feel less hectic? Cruel? Paced? More authentic? More like you owned it because there wasn’t any technology involved? Because you weren’t bombarded by all these little notifications and e-mails and messages that keep your mind in all other possible places but not actually in your life?
As you can see, it is a good place for meditation. As a bonus, this place has the only proper Turkish coffee in Prague, made and served in a proper little copper cezve. Mmm!
Cukrkavalimonada
Simply the best place in Mala Strana (the area of Prague on the other side of Charles Bridge). Especially good for salads, pasta and mouth-watering desserts. Because the tables are so close to each other, also very good for eavesdropping. Once I overheard a conversation between a woman — she was a teacher of Czech — and her date, apparently a “project manager”. I initially thought he was a spy, because he was carefully avoiding all talk about his work, giving vague answers like — “I am from US and work on some projects that have to do with Europe”. But in the end I thought may be he was just an asshole, trying to sound more important than he really was.
Anyway, if you love fresh food with an Italian twist — this place calls upon you. Be sure to bring a decent amount of cash though, as they don’t accept credit cards!
Do you enjoy visiting cafes by yourself? What does your favourite cafe look and feel like? I’d be very curious to know. And if you recommend another atmospherical cafe in Prague, i’ll be more than happy to check it out and include it in my list! Happy cafe-strolling!

The art museums in Prague hold some great works of art that you need to see during your trip. Why listen to my recommendations? I am an artist and I’ve been living in the Czech Republic for 10 months now. In this article, I am sharing with you the must-see art museums in Prague.
Read next: 6 Art Museums in Florence: The masterpieces you need to
I am starting with the Lubkowicz Palace because it holds a collection of artifacts that tell the most about Czech history.
The Palace entry ticket comes with an audio-guide that helps you explore Bohemian and European history through the Lobkowicz family and their collections — one of Europe’s oldest and finest private art collections, comprised of items dating back over 2,000 years. The collection highlights include paintings by Bruegel the Elder, Canaletto, and Velázquez and hand-annotated manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven.
P.S: The audio guide is narrated in English by two generations of the Lobkowicz family and the collections’ curators (also available in 10 other languages). The additional Prague InSpires Panorama audiotour introduces visitors to the city’s most iconic landmarks in under 30 minutes from the Lobkowicz Palace balcony.
My favorite museum in Prague is the national gallery (not to be confused with the national museum). With origins dating back to the 18th century, it is one of the oldest, largest, and most respected art museums in Central Europe. What makes this gallery unique is that its collections are spread out in various Baroque palaces, Medieval convents, and castles all around Prague. So, it is not one building but many different building. You can check out the official website for more details on the different buildings, opening hours, and ticket prices.
The National Gallery is particularly well-known for its wide collection of modern artists such as Picasso, Rousseau, Monet, and Cézanne. the National Gallery has an extensive collection of works by great Czech artists.
One of the most recognizable works in the National Gallery’s collection is Vincent van Gogh’s Green Field (1889). This is one of many landscape paintings Van Gogh produced while recovering at a mental asylum in Provence and it shows the painter at the height of his creative powers.
A not-so-popular museum, but if you are an art enthusiast, you definitely know the iconic master of Art Nouveau Alphonse Mucha. However, you may not know that he was actually Czech because he mostly lived in Paris during the Art Nouveau period. Mucha produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, and designs, which became among the best-known images of the period. For that, I think the museum deserves a visit.
At the age of 57, Mucha returned to his homeland and devoted himself to a series of twenty monumental symbolist canvases known as The Slav Epic, depicting the history of the Slavic people. On the 10th anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered The Slav Epic his most important work.
Not really an art museum but the Clementinum is Prague’s second-largest building complex after Prague Castle and houses the most beautiful library in the world. Among the 27,000 old printed works, there are, for example, Kepler’s writings with his handwritten dedication to his friends, the dean, and other professors at the Prague university. The Jesuits founded the Clementinum in 1556 and named it after the former Dominican monastery of St. Clement from 1227, where they settled. In 1775, meteorological data began to be collected here regularly; thus Prague has the longest continuous series of meteorological observations in Europe.
Prague is a gorgeous city that holds a significant number of museums and historical attractions. If I were to pick only one art museum to see in Prague, I’d visit The National Gallery, as it is the richest, widest and most interesting art collection in Prague. However, make sure to, once in yo

I lived in the greater Seattle area for three years. I’ve lived in Prague for five months. Here’s my take on the wins and losses in both countries.
1Topic: SmokingWinner: Seattle
As a lifelong non-smoker, I define a country’s smoking success as having less of a smoking culture. Compared to the US, Prague has a huge smoking culture. According to data from the Czech National Cancer Control Programme, about 25% of Czechs smoke, compared to approximately 15% of Americans.
Anecdotally, I’ve noticed much more smoking on the sidewalks, in parks, and in the outdoor sections of restaurants in Prague than in the US. Every time I walk through a smoke cloud in Prague, I long for the US.
2Topic: DogsWinner: Prague
If you’re a dog-lover, Prague has two really awesome parts of dog culture that make it better than the US:
3Topic: Dog PoopWinner: Seattle
Czechs don’t pick up dog poop. :( I almost had to stop picking up my dog’s poop in Prague because I physically could not find anywhere to buy poop bags and could not consistently find publicly-provided ones. For months, I lived off the supply I brought from the US, then finally restocked when I was on vacation in Asia.
But don’t take my word for it. A reply on a TripAdvisor forum went as far as to encourage people to not pick up dog poop, as it labeled you as a foreigner. And this poignant excerpt from the Czech Expats page, titled “Poo Fighters” (the Seattlite in me approves of the title), explains the issue even better:
There’s the issue of doggy do-do. However positively disposed you are towards our four-legged friends, no-one enjoys stepping in a steaming pile of poop. Yet despite all those green disposal bins supplied with free brown, erm, doggy bags, some owners persistently fail to clear up after their pets… Matters have become so serious that Prague 7’s district council is considering DNA testing feces at the scene of the crime in order to track down the responsible pooches.
I don’t think I’ve ever stepped in dog poop in the US. In Prague, I’ve stepped in it more than half a dozen times. Get your shit together, Prague. Literally.
4Topic: Public TransportWinner: Prague
If you want reliable, dependable, and affordable public transport, Prague is an easy choice. On a normal weekday, if you miss your metro, the next one is only two minutes away. Two. Minutes. From this list of best global public transportation, Prague ranks within the top 25:
In the US, conversely, public transport is a nightmare of inconsistent times on incomplete routes. I can personally speak to the abhorrent public transportation Pittsburgh offered during my college years; with the minor experience I’ve accumulated, I can also briefly speak to Seattle’s public transport. That said, with the exception of New York, none of them compares with any of the public transport systems I’ve used in Europe. For the curious, Now This News covered the historical reasons why the US is transportationally behind the rest of the world (summary: we chose highways).
5Topic: Health CareWinner: Prague
I caught a lung infection within my first two months in Prague. I went to the doctor but didn’t have my work-supplied insurance card yet. They charged me without insurance for an emergency, unscheduled visit with a nurse practitioner. I approached the checkout desk post-appointment, waiting for the immense sans-insurance bill. As I stood, cringing, watching the lips of the receptionist read out my balance, seemingly in slow motion, it was… $35. Without insurance.
In the US, my boyfriend had some blood tests done in a scheduled appointment and was charged $1,500 post-insurance. Prague obviously wins here.
It’s not just cost, however. It’s also coverage. In the Czech Republic, every citizen is by-default insured. In the US, over 10% of adults do not have health insurance. Health insurance for all is definitely a win.
You go, Czech Republic.
6Topic: Automatic Sliding DoorsWinner: Seattle
Sliding doors in the Czech Republic have two major issues:
In the US, sliding doors open in such a way that you just keep walking, and the doors will move to not impede your pace. Czech doors, in contrast, will open after you’ve been standing in front of them for a few seconds. On my first day in Prague I tried to enter a mall, but the sliding doors weren’t sliding. I figured the mall was still closed. It wasn’t. I just didn’t wait long enough for the sliding doors to engage. I texted my American friend living in Denmark about it. She confirmed that European sliding doors just suck.
I only have anecdotal and social evidence to back up my claims, however, I know I’m not the only one to have noticed this. I don’t know this person, but based on their rant, I can tell we’re soulmates in another life:
2. The doors have different opening widths depending on the season
Czech sliding doors open less in winter. I get it, they save energy. However, this algorithm has a ton of problems. First, you get used to one opening width and then have to acclimate to another. This wouldn’t be a problem, except that you’re usually not paying much attention to the doors when walking through them. Suddenly — SURPRISE. They unexpectedly open narrower than they used to and you walk into the door. I wish I were kidding, but the sliding glass doors at my work cracked in the winter, I presume for this very reason.
And second, the narrow width is a huge bottleneck. Luckily, waiting outside doors in the winter is one of my favorite pastimes. Oh wait, it’s not.
Get with it Prague.
7Topic: Drinking CultureWinner: Prague
US drinking law: No open alcohol on the streets, absolutely no open containers in cars, and .08 BAC to drive. And that .08 BAC is something a drunk person has to self-gauge. Ne dobry (that means “not good” in Czech).
Prague drinking law: Open alcohol containers are mostly legal, open containers in the car are fine as long as the driver doesn’t partake, and drivers must have 0 BAC. There’s no tolerance for drunk driving, or even buzzed driving, in the Czech Republic. 👍
The Prague drinking laws make Czech drinking culture less restrictive for people enjoying responsibly. Additionally, they’re not so strict that they ironically encourage more drinking, like in the US, where paper-bagging alcohol or hiding alcohol in a bottle of Gatorade is a common sight. And finally, the zero-tolerance rule for drivers makes drunk driving less prevalent in Europe.
In the US, alcohol is involved in 23% of traffic-related deaths. In the Czech Republic, that same statistic is 4%. And the Czech Republic is one of the worst offenders in the EU.
8Topic: ShoppingWinner: Seattle
You know what I miss about the US? Target. Need to find some obscure household item? Target has it. Target doesn’t have it? Amazon surely does.
What happens in the Czech Republic? Well, if you want to find that same obscure household item… well, you can go to… fuck it, I don’t know. There are no major shopping centers like Target or Walmart. Think you can turn to Amazon next? Nope, there’s no Amazon in the Czech Republic. Your only options are to use Germany’s Amazon service, or the Czech Republic’s Amazon equivalent, Alza.cz.
I miss you, US shopping. ❤
9Topic: TechnologyWinner: Seattle
One of Prague’s charms is its rustic, classic look. The streets are still cobblestone, the buildings are still original. Apparently, Prague is so beautiful that Hitler himself was inspired to spare it. Consequently, it’s one of the few places in this part of Europe that wasn’t bombed in WWII, so it’s one rarity that preserved its vintage appearance.
Unfortunately, that old-school culture also makes Prague lag the rest of the world in adoption and prevalence of technology. Do you enjoy elevators? Get ready to use some slow, old, questionable elevators that you’re not sure will hold your weight. The one in my apartment building doesn’t even have up or down buttons — just a call button. When my dog chewed up my laptop charging cord, I quickly found out I couldn’t get a replacement in the Czech Republic (luckily, my work had an extra lying around). When I lost my Fitbit charger, I was forced to order one from Amazon Germany.
This carries on to other parts of daily life. When I was apartment hunting, almost nobody accepted emails. You had to call, and calling meant you had to speak Czech. Welp.
Welcome to the shitshow that is the Czech technology scene. Missing you rn, America.
10Topic: Customer ServiceWinner: Seattle
Need help at a store? Czechs don’t give a fuck. Want a shopping cart? Gotta put in a coin to get one. Want a bag for your items? Gotta pay for that too. Need a restroom while shopping? Get ready to pay again.
Generally, Czech store representatives and systems are ruder, less-helpful, and more prohibitive than in the US. It’s even worse if they figure out you’re a foreigner.
Check out this poignant quote and related article with more formalized data on Czech customer service:
In the Czech Republic, a basic lack of understanding of the minimum level of courtesy required when dealing with the public seems all too widespread — and it’s costing companies dearly. A survey by telecommunications firm Genesys estimates that Czech businesses lose 1.08 billion US dollars annually because of substandard customer service.
11Topic: Elderly CommunityWinner: Prague
Perhaps because of the prevalence of public transport and the de-emphasis of cars, elderly people are active and all over Prague. It’s really refreshing to see independent elderly people around the city, a rare sight in the US. If you want to stay active in your senior years, I’d prescribe Prague.
12Topic: BathroomsWinner: Prague
Do you love knowing who’s in the bathroom with you based on the shoes sticking out beneath the stalls? Making eye contact through the stall gap? Do you enjoy people hearing you poop? And hearing other people poop?
Europe has none of these things. Water closets are God’s gift to relieving yourself. They’re little, private, sealed, closed rooms where you can do your business discretely and in peace. Mmmmmm.
The only downside is that Europe has a bad habit of charging for bathrooms. But with bathrooms this delightful, I’ll take it.
Topic: WaterWinner: Seattle
I ask for few things in life. One of them, however, is free, still, ice water without a lemon in it. Seattle gets this. Prague does not. Most Czech restaurants don’t offer free water, and when you ask for water, they offer you the option of still or sparkling. And when your paid-for, over-specified water does arrive, it usually includes a lemon. And no ice. Shame on you Prague.
(I realize that most of this is personal preference. Please indulge my rant)
And there you have it! What I love and don’t love about my two homes, Prague and Seattle. Did you come to the end of this article looking for me to call a winner? I’m sorry to disappoint. Both cities have a special place in my heart.

Just two girls on a city break with a fascination with pretty buildings.
The Old Town in Prague, Zone 1, is bustling with amazing architecture, Czech landmarks and an abundance of food stalls, restaurants and shops. Before departing on our break, my friend and I had a list of attractions we were keen to see which included the well-known Astronomical clock, the infinite book tower in the Municipal Library and the rotating Kafka head. However, we found that simply walking down the street was entertainment enough. Both of us were in awe of the city’s creative architecture, clean streets and colourful buildings. This combined with the cobbled paths, countless clocks and mini archways connecting buildings together had me convinced that I should be moving to Prague some time in my future. The use of space here was so appealing and interesting, with charming restaurants providing seating under mini bridges — I was overcome with endless things to look at and appreciate. In the two and a half days and 60,000 steps we were there for, we Czech-ed everything off our list and left eager to return.
Day one was a travel day, and, after an early start and some unexpected extra leg room seats, we arrived at our hotel located twenty minutes’ walk outside of the Old Town. With no real idea of where we were going, and no knowledge of direction between us, we set off in the general direction of the ‘city centre.’ As it turned out, we were soon met with a high street of stores, food places and souvenir shops. Even the architecture of familiar shops we regularly frequent at home, such as H&M and Zara, had us amazed with their intricate brick work and elegant lighting. We came across a market with stalls selling fresh fruit and souvenirs before accidentally, but fortunately, arriving in the Old Town Square — location of the Astronomical clock. The square was beautiful with outdoor seating, stringed fairy lights and once again, the cool Czech architecture. After, of course, taking some pictures we joined a crowd of people gathered around the oldest clock still in operation and wondered what we were waiting for. As the five o’clock hour hit, we all watched in silence as the clock chimed with a little “cuckoo” at the end. Also, we found the Sex museum which gave us lots of laughs as there is a chair in the entrance way with a ‘Love Tester’ scale rating you from frozen to sex bomb. My friend and I were disappointed to find out that we were ‘tepid’ and ‘frozen’ and left once I’d had another go to determine that I am in fact ‘boiling’ and the first try was just a practise. Afterwards, we headed in the direction of shops we knew we couldn’t afford for some window shopping and more picture taking. We stared gormlessly at handbags and amazing coats in the likes of Dior, Prada and Louis Vuitton before admitting defeat and going in search of food. For our first night, we decided to tick off Prague’s hard rock café and enjoyed some great food there before heading homewards for an early night.
Prague day two began with a slow start, still sleepy from the early rise the day prior. However, arriving at the breakfast buffet, coupled with some strong coffee, eased away our tiredness and we vaguely planned out our day. Our plan was to firm the queue outside the Municipal library in order to see the infinite book tower but once again, our poor sense of direction lead us to a different landmark on our list. We stopped and took in the rotating Kafka head before agreeing it was time to pull out apple maps and stick to our plan. After queueing for about 30–40 minutes on a hot, sunny day in Czech we approached the tower of books. The illusion this tower creates through the use of mirrors is incredible — when you look down it feels like if you stepped through you would fall forever. This was a hotspot for tourists from all over the world and many pictures were taken here. The tower contains around 8,000 books and I would highly recommend this attraction. The heat and the walking had us hungry, so we headed around the corner to a little café called ‘Coffee and Waffles’ recommended to us on TikTok and as described, we ordered a coffee and waffle each. They had some very interesting waffle and coffee choices — I had a caprese waffle and my friend had a Crème Brulé coffee, which I was jealous I didn’t get myself. The atmosphere inside was calming and lovely and I enjoyed my first savoury waffle — even if it did take a minute to get used to the variety of textures. Our afternoon consisted of shopping… we couldn’t help ourselves! We each bought clothes to wear to dinner that night and headed to the hotel in the evening to change for dinner. As our day had been so jam packed and busy, we had lost track of timing and the restaurant we had planned to visit for dinner was fully booked (this place was called Pasta Fresca and was also fully booked the next evening too so I would recommend booking well in advance as it must be popular). However, we found another lovely Italian place not far from it and enjoyed dinner outside whilst people watching and discussing our day. Once we’d settled the bill, we headed back to the centre to grab a chimney cake. These are absolutely amazing — a chimney shaped dough with fillings such as ice cream or chocolate and strawberries. This was definitely a tourist staple! After forcing our stomachs to accept more food, we went to bed, sad to be heading into our last day in Prague.
Another hot and sunny day commenced, and we set off walking around more cool buildings and churches that we had missed the last two days. Today was the day for some souvenir shopping and presents for family and friends. There were so many options for these kinds of gifts and, after purchasing some postcards, we moved onto a place we had clocked on our first day. This shop is called Candy Miners and is a pick n mix shop where all the sweets are stored in old miners’ carriages and scales. The experience was really cool, and the sweets contained some unique and interesting shapes and flavours. We spent some time in there selecting an assortment of sweets for our partners. We also headed to the chocolate museum and shop which, again, had some very curious flavours to try — and a lot of phallic shaped chocolate (not very appropriate for the parents!). All of this shopping had us thirsty, so we found a nice juice bar — come — café and sat down outside for a relax. For dinner on our last night, we found another highly recommended place from TikTok (where we apparently get all of our travel advice) and walked over to Prague 2. The place is called Hoxton burgers, and it was ten out of ten. We each got a beef smashed burger, passion fruit lemonade and shared a loaded bacon cheesy fries. The atmosphere and lighting were very unique and edgy and, once again, we were full to bursting. Finally, we made our way across the road to the church of St Ludmila, which was extremely pretty, and took our last pictures in Prague before returning to the hotel to pack and prepare for our early morning flight.
All in all, Prague was a fantastic city break and my friend and I are both keen to return. I think that next time I go, I would like to try more traditional Czech food and visit some of the other zones as the majority of our time was spent in Prague zone 1 and 2. In terms of the city itself, the area was extremely clean and well presented and Czech residents were exceptionally lovely and considerate.
I hope you enjoyed reading! :)

Nestled in the heart of Europe, Prague stands as a testament to the seamless fusion of history, architecture, and culture. Its magnetic allure has made it a global sensation, drawing in millions of visitors each year. But what is it about Prague that makes it so popular worldwide?
In the heart of Europe lies Prague, a city that seems to have borrowed pieces of history from various centuries and woven them into its very streets. For those with an appreciation for architecture, Prague is nothing short of a living museum, where each building tells a story of a bygone era.
Gothic, Baroque, and Romanesque Harmony — What makes Prague stand out is its remarkable blend of architectural styles. As you wander through its enchanting streets, you’ll encounter a seamless fusion of Gothic, Baroque, and Romanesque designs. It’s like taking a stroll through time, where every turn unveils a different chapter in the city’s architectural evolution.
Prague Castle: A Symbol of Grandeur — At the pinnacle of this architectural symphony stands the iconic Prague Castle. This colossal structure, overlooking the city, is a testament to centuries of history. Gothic spires reach for the sky, Baroque…

Prague
I had not heard a single negative thing about Prague before arriving — most of the travelers I had encountered prior had preached about how amazing of a city it is. This had my expectations sky-high for the Czech city, which I hereby declare the Interstellar Mistake (Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Hans Zimmer, reality-based space sci-fi… how could it have not been the best film of all time?!) When I only get to visit a place for a few days, my entire perception of it is largely dependent on the weather while I’m there (Ireland is beautifully sunny and warm, in case you were unaware). Unfortunately for me, my visit to Prague was accompanied by clouds, rain, and cold weather.
That said, it still is architecturally a magnificent place, thanks partially to it not being blown up by war. After all the historically significant, gigantic, celebrated churches I’ve seen over the past three months, the Gothic churches of Prague are far and away my favorite. The charred-looking stone and ridiculously intricate gold and black ornamentation stand out prominently above the other buildings of the city. The largest of these, St. Vitus Cathedral, sits in the middle of the Prague castle on the top of a hill overlooking the Vltava river. The castle itself is a pretty well protected peek into the past, with the palace, churches, shops, and residencies that once inhabited the space within the castle walls.
Another thing Prague does do well is public / street art. This is also most definitely in response to Soviet rule of the city. One particular space called the “Lennon Wall” celebrates the freedom to write anything on a public wall without an authority covering it up. Every day, hundreds of people come by and paint their own drawings and words on the wall, which is now feet thicker due to so many coats of paint. Beyond this street art, there are many humorous statues with implied political meaning, such as giant bronze babies with barcodes instead of faces, and two men urinating in a pool shaped as the Czech Republic. I don’t exactly remember the point of that one, but it’s funny nonetheless. Hopefully one day I’ll be able to return to Prague under clearer weather and lower expectations, and be able to thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the place.

Prague is beautiful and it never lets you go. If you are lucky enough to visit it, then likely you will end up doing the same things the majority of the tourists do: sightsee Prague Castle, shop at the Old Town square, take a picture near the John Lennon wall and cross Charles Bridge.
There is nothing wrong with checking all the “touristy attractions”, but there is just so much more to Prague, and I would not like you to miss that. When you take a few steps away from Prague’s most famous spots— a world brimming with lively culture opens up.
I was born in Prague and even if I lived in other cities, Prague will be always my hometown. It is a beautiful and unique city with many things to do and see. I will show you some secret, local-approved things you must do when in Prague. Here they are.
I strongly recommend checking the lesser-known 10th-century castle of Vysehrad. It offers some great views of the river and the city but also features lovely grounds perfect for picnics and gatherings with friends. Some of…

When you visit Prague, the list of landmarks to see is quite obvious — The Prague Castle, Old Town, Charles Bridge with its famous statues. But between them you may find some strange… things, let’s say. In such a case, it’s very possible you’ve just come across the work of Czech artist, David Černý. And as strange as they are, all of them are worth seeing.
Here’s the shortlist of his work list — for more, visit davidcerny.cz
One of the most characteristic sculptures of Černý is St. Wenceslas riding a dead horse, hanging in the passage of Lucerna Palace.
If you have already walked on the nearby Wenceslas Square, you might think this looks somehow familiar. Indeed, this sculpture was inspired by the famous Statue of Saint Wenceslas. It’s even the same in size. But the horse is dead, and upside down. Don’t ask. Allegedly, it represents the idea of thinking that everything is fine, even if it’s not.
Nevertheless, move to the nearby Quadrio Shopping Centre — to its back entrance, to be precise. You won’t miss the enormous, steel sculpture of Franz Kafka, the famous Austrian-Czech writer. His head, to be precise.
It’s 10 meters tall and made of 42 rotating stainless steel panels. It doesn’t really belong to the Old Town, which is probably the best reason for placing it right there (it stands on the private ground). The Czech sense of humor.
Speaking of heads, one of the most recent works is the monument of Trifot, 12-meter tall sculpture inspired by Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham. To reach it, you should take Metro Line B and get out at Nove Butovice station.
The eyes of the Trifot are actually camera lenses, which are able to take the photos of passers-by. And those photos can be shown on the nearby screens (unfortunately, this was out of order in 2023, when I visited Prague — don’t know if it works now). Quite a nod to the omnipresent user tracking.
But Černý’s work is not limited to sculptures only. You can see the part of him in everyday objects. Like the counter top in Mlynska Cafe (Kavárna Mlýnská) in Kampa Park.
Partly a pub, partly a cafe, Mlynska serves as a cozy place for a drink, located in an old mill. If you sit at the bar, you’ll notice a unique counter top created by Černý. It’s actually a mix of rubbish found in Vltava, and random stuff left by the visitors — all immersed in an artificial resin. In a certain sense, it’s a picture of local life, stuck forever like archaeological treasures on a museum exhibition.
Speaking of museums, if you want to explore the world of David Černý’s mind, you should visit Musoleum, where you’ll find many of his other works, including Entropa, his variation on European Union countries.
Oddly enough, even though the work was unveiled in 2009, United Kingdom is not represented (in other words, represented as a missing piece) in the sculpture. It was then a symbol of British isolation from Europe, and only predicted Brexit 7 yeards later.

The Czech capital guards its secrets.
We came late to Prague. By the time we made our way to the red-roofed city, the path to the east was already well-beaten by hordes of budget travelers and lairy British stag parties. An influx of foreign tourists has pushed Prague close to the top of the list of Europe’s most visited cities, with all the opportunities and problems that kind of popularity creates for the local residents.
But Prague is every bit as beautiful as it was back when it seemed so exotic, smiling shyly behind the Iron Curtain. The Haussmannian grandeur of the Old Town buildings invites comparison with Paris, but Parisiens would never allow their buildings to be painted like this. Bright yellow next to powder blue beside terracotta. And while tourists gape at the astronomical clock that jerks into life twenty-four times a day, the sun — when it shines — gilds the dark spires of the Church of Our Lady of Tyn and makes the old stones glow as brightly as the painted buildings.
The same force that makes a person wander the world pushes flowers from the ground to salute the distant sun. The artists of Prague don’t stop painting the old buildings just because they can no longer afford to own them. Among the graffiti of the Old Town, two themes recurred: the Golem, as played by Paul Wegener in the 1920 horror film he directed. And the simple phrase, in English: Life Is Beautiful.
Flowers bloom and die and never leave a mark, and for most of us, this beautiful life is the same.
Few of us shape history, like the dead kings in their cold tombs on the high hill where Prague’s castle stands. But that doesn’t keep us from trying. For an additional fee that’s as steep as the stairs, you can climb the tower of St Vitus Cathedral and look out across the river at Prague. And up there, in the teeth of the wind that rises from the Vltava, you can see the old stones scored with the initials of decades of visitors, the merged letters in a dozen languages forming the ridges and valleys of an insensate fingerprint.
Prague isn’t as cheap as it used to be when the first intrepid tourists arrived from the West after the fall of Communism. But it’s still an absolute steal compared to the likes of Paris or London or Barcelona. Two nights at the gorgeous five star Art Nouveau Palace cost 166 euros after tax. Dinner and drinks for two at a Michelin starred restaurant for 200. Prague still represents a great deal for a budget traveler and offers a chance to splash out on high-end experiences at a price you could never hope to pay in other European capitals.
Prague has other marks, too. Scars with gloomier origins than the vandalizing initials of bright and brutish tourists.
On the day we visited, a young woman was lighting a candle in front of the narrow window of the church basement. The stone is still pockmarked with holes, where Nazi bullets once struck sparks from the walls. Seven hundred and fifty soldiers launched attack after attack on the church, but couldn’t dislodge the men hiding inside.
After hours of fighting, the Germans brought in the fire brigade and ordered them to flood the basement. Not one of the Czech freedom fighters was taken alive. The mission cost them their lives and the lives of anyone connected to them. It also prompted Nazi massacres in villages entirely unconnected with the plot. But it was the only successful assassination of a high-ranking Nazi officer. The war would continue, of course, with or without Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler’s ‘man with an iron heart.’ But at the cost of their lives, Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis, Adolf Opalka, Josef Bublik, Jaroslav Svarc, Josef Valcik, and Jan Hruby proved that despite their military prowess, even the highest-ranking officials of the Nazi government could be killed. And 70 years later, Czechs still honor the bravery of men willing to die for their country.
Some fights are worth having. And life is beautiful. So beautiful that sometimes it’s worth losing.
Prague feels like the kind of place with secrets. It’s still relatively new to modern mass tourism, having been shut off behind the Iron Curtain within my lifetime. You can see it in the bullet marks, or in the creepy statue of the Commendatore outside the theater where Mozart’s Don Giovanni premiered. You can see it in the frowning face of the ubiquitous Golem.
Stories make cities what they are, just as they do for people. We become the sum of what we experience, our cathedrals and our bullet holes. Our spires and basements. We may be the wealthiest and most fortunate group of people in human history, and yet so many of us are afraid. Afraid to lose what we have. Afraid to fail. Afraid of others who are themselves prisoners of fear, that makes them lash out and bite anyone they can reach. Fear lives at the heart of our culture, the magic word written down and stuffed into the hollow clay skull of the Golem to make it live.
Tyranny comes in many forms, and fear has always been one of its favorite weapons. Prisons without bars are the hardest to escape. I’m living proof that you can spend your whole life making what seems like the right decision and never get any closer to what you really want — the raw experience of being alive. Inside each of us, an iron-hearted voice commands caution, and while we hoard worthless tokens and live in fear of losing, we miss the bright imperfect world sailing by.
And yet we all want to make our mark. That brief blaze of light across an immensity of darkness, to say in some way to the uncaring universe that we were here. This is mine, a few words held out into the world like writing on water, vanishing even in the act of creation. The rough wind whirls the ticket from my hand, and I carry on without it, lighter for the loss.

Prague is a European city I’ve always wanted to visit.
Since I was a child, I marveled at images of its cobblestone streets and remarkable buildings. So, when I got a chance to visit Prague for 24 hours, I was determined to make the most of the opportunity.
Here’s how I spent 24 hours in Prague:
My boyfriend and I woke up bright and early, buzzing with excitement for the day ahead. As we left our hotel room and wandered the cobblestone streets, we found the city quite empty before 8 am.
We heard a rumor that many people sleep in after a fun night out of drinking. After all, beer is often cheaper than bottled water, and Czechs consume more beer per capita than any other country in the world.
We were relieved to have a quieter beginning to the day. Yesterday, when we’d wheeled our suitcases from the bus stop to our hotel, we realized that many crosswalks in Prague did not have pedestrian signals. Most of the time…

August 28, 2012.
I had just finished my dietetic internship in NYC at the hospital formerly known as Beth Israel Medical Center, now transitioned to Mount Sinai, and I felt a sense of freedom. Where better to reap the benefits of this long-lost feeling than wander around Eastern Europe, specifically Bohemia, specifically Prague?
I hopped on an ICE fast train from Leipzig, Germany to Prague. Back then I had no smartphone, and I used a paper map to guide my way through the winding European streets. I got around just fine, except for that one time I was lost in the rain at 2 am. I did eventually find my way back to the Hotel Sunflower.
One thing I pack with me while traveling is a notebook and pen to write down thoughts, ideas, things I would like to do and see; places to eat and drink. My weekend in Bohemia included a typical tourist visit to Prague Castle and the Staropramen Brewery, yet it also included some not-for-tourist places such as Tynska Bar & Books, and this other place I had read about that was known for its vegetarian food in the land of pork knuckle and dumplings. The Czech name of the restaurant is Lehka Hlava, which translates to Clear Head.
Perfect, I thought. The name called to me after my long-lost night. I needed to clear my head.
After I arrived and was taken to my table at the restaurant I noticed a table of four women near my table of one. They were laughing, and enjoying their food and wine. Seeing them made me miss my friends back home. I bounced back into the present and ordered a full meal complete with a starter, a main, and a dessert with one glass of wine.
Looking back all these years later I cannot remember exactly what I ordered, but I do remember that the meal I had that evening in Prague was the best meal I had while traveling Bohemia. I remember the bill was equivalent to about 12 US dollars, which has been embedded into my memory since I was a graduate student at NYU at the time— not rich in money, but rich in books.
Although I cannot recall exactly what I chose on the menu nor did I take any photos of it, I do know that my solo dining experience was welcomed, and the food was honestly delicious.
Now many years later I glance at the menu on my computer. It includes items such as pumpkin and ginger soup with orange juice, vegetable consommé with yeast dumplings, spaghetti with tempeh bacon and sauce of baked garlic, gértaix — cheese balls with cumin sticks, wasabi dressing, and balsamic reduction, Kimchi-potato pancake — traditional Czech potato pancake with kimchi and spring onion, and hot raspberry crumble with mascarpone-ricotta cream.
The menu reflects the diversity of the chefs at Lehka Hlava, and each dish has a goal to both electrify and soothe the senses. I still think about this restaurant now and then. It pops into my mind as “those carefree days.” It was such a relaxing atmosphere and left me with a sense of, well, clarity. I left Prague happy and with lucidity. I did not get lost that night with my paper map.

“I don’t have a girlfriend, but I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that.”
-Mitch
I decided on Prague next because Kevin had told me you can get wasted there for 5 bucks. That was enough for me. Kevin always knows the right move. Except for the time he jumped into the Chicago River, drunk as hell, to rescue a shoe. That was dumb. The Czech Republic had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
The only issue with Prague was the overnight, 14-hour train ride I needed to take to get there. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to go. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost the equivalent of 4 Euros/night (about $6 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be 3 hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is some deceptive bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand am/pm clocks?
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were torched. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was just me and a few other people who also couldn’t tell time.

April 4, 2006
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple mini baguettes and a bunch of bananas to supplement. I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, lying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling and nodding. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
I put my index finger up, the international sign for “wait a minute,” and went to the bar car to grab four cups. I took some Adderall too, knowing that it was no longer going to be a Tylenol PM type of night. Drugs allow you to execute hairpin turns like an F1 driver.
Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they stood and received their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all good and drunk, telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; four guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dad thoughts.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train and ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like city; the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of walking and smoking, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel.” They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was. Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. I wanted to thank them to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me in what I assumed was Czech for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics. Only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad. When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Nevercomment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in the middle of the night. It’s best to just listen.

When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. It looked like the Catacombs, minus the bones. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon because it was my grandfather’s name, and because I’ve never known a sane Simon. When I was a kid, I went to camp with a Simon who got expelled for torturing animals. And then there was the Simon I knew in Iowa whose party trick was chewing glass and swallowing it. Tons of deviant Simons are roaming the earth unchecked, and it worries me.
Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday.” (The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX). She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was more of a single-cheek, shy smirk, than an all-out smile. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows, and was dressed casually, in blue jeans and a V-neck sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I can usually spot a fellow speed freak, so I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a stumble until the bars opened so he could extend his bender another day.

April 5, 2006
When I came down to the common area the next morning, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. Again, I’m looking at you, London. I was impressed the way she carried herself in the kitchen, and by her motherly sensibilities. She took on the role of “hostel mom” naturally, making sure everyone had a homemade meal before embarking on the day. That really attracted me. (Freud would have another field day with me liking mom-types).
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. It’s so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class Americans wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happen in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were dating.
*
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: We are, Johnny… I’m the umpire so I have final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick.
“Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular in its’ simplicity. It reminded me of a hotel conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer.
When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We pulled up seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked the beers over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on out we were old friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid onto the table. I knew moonshine when I saw it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could see straight. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others cackled. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech music and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling. Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching like Dave used to. Every time we got close, he’d scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: (sarcastically) Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar, where we drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: Running from my feelings? Trying to become my own man? I’m not totally sure anymore. Since my dad died last year, I just can’t stop speeding, that’s all I know.
Caroline: I understand.
Me: Do you?
Caroline: My younger brother died in a car crash last year.
Me: So, you’re doing the same thing?
Caroline: Yeah. I keep telling myself that running away from something means you’re running towards something else, but lately it hasn’t been working. So, I came here to forget myself altogether.
Me: How’s that working?
Caroline: It’s not really. Grief is just a cunt.
Me: Same and same.
Caroline: How about we run together and if that makes it any better?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I hear Bratislava is nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t watch it between now and tomorrow.

Which part of Himachal are you from?I am actually not from Himachal, but from Madhya Pradesh.But you’re a Thakur?Yes, MP as well has Thakurs.
This is how my first interaction with most people at Himachal Pradesh (the northern state that hosts my workplace IIT Mandi) begins, people with last name Thakur being omnipresent here. However, perhaps the most famous Thakur was from West Bengal (a state in the East of India), and interestingly, he is known more commonly as a Tagore in India. At Prague — the city of hundred spires — though, my stay was booked at Thakurova — the Thakur street — and so I knew I would be welcome at Czechia.
My trip to Boston (recall Tryst with America?) had made me acquaintance with Prof. Jan Vitek’s group at Northeastern University. I met him again during ECOOP 2019 (recall Romance at London?) — we knew we were working in similar areas — so he suggested I visit his laboratory at Czech Technical University, where I would hopefully be able to formalize a working relationship. And thus the seed to a trip to Prague — one of my most memorable trips ever — was sown.
In general I would have been worried about the cold weather at Prague in January. However, having settled after the London trip at Mandi, in one of the coldest states of India, I wasn’t much excited (read worried) about the weather. This, however, also translated to not being prepared for the trip at all. My first teaching semester at IIT Mandi ended in December, and it was only after that, that I started planning a trip — my longest abroad till date — to Prague in January. Two things I was more thoughtful about, though, were (i) The Visa; and (ii) The Trip to Delhi — you will get to know a very suspenseful story about both in Rendezvous with Athena. TLDR: The Visa was smooth, I travelled to Delhi a day before this time, and hence obtained a comfortable flight hopping for an hour at Sharjah (the place I knew from childhood for Cricket matches).
Prague is known to be a beautiful city, and a very welcoming one for tourists. I was supposed to stay 12 nights at a hostel-cum-hotel (wrongly known as a dorm) named Masaryk Colej. The second word indicates its association with the college CVUT (Czech Technical University, in English). Travel from the airport was quite comfortable: you buy an hourly ticket for public travel in Prague and can then take any bus, tram, or metro — very convenient for those who don’t understand the currency or the local addresses. So I took a bus and a tram (Pristi zastavka) and reached the hotel. First surprise: I was provided with a map to find my room! And indeed, the map was damn useful — you need to pass through a cobweb of rooms (smelling the varieties of food college guys keep cooking in there) to finally reach the corridor that forms the “hotel” part of the huge building. I needed the map on quite a few occasions (specially when I decided to wander around the building trying to get a glimpse of the food).
I used to walk daily to the university, take the lift to the 13th floor (tried the stairs one day!), and come back in the evening. Pretty standard. So what I would do next, is to mainly discuss the interesting trips — solo as well as group — along with the classical places I visited, the people I met, and the heart-warming experiences that I got in the extremely cold weather (subzero on almost all days). Not to forget the funny stories surrounding the food!
This was the first time I was visiting a place that’s famous for its exotic food — but almost all non-veg. The first day I located a Pizza outlet with vegetarian options, about 1.5 miles from my hotel. I had taken my warmest clothes, but God it was really difficult following Google Map as you need to take your gloves off (I got enlightened about touchscreen-enabled gloves much later). Being in Europe I knew I didn’t have to worry much about tips and the phrases for taking home versus dining-in as in the US (Europe and India have pretty much similar terminologies, owing to history). Breakfasts were taken care of by the hotel (with two kinds of cupcakes, orange juice, toast, and cheese forming the 365-day menu). Lunches (and some dinner outings on weekdays): I knew I would have enough expertise from the lab in sailing through the university canteen. However, things became adventurous when I decided to try the hotel restaurant for a dinner:
Me: “Which all options in the menu are vegetarian?”She: [After the previous sentence being looped over 20 times]: “Yes, please sit; we will bring you vegetarian.”
On table I get something that looks very muttonish. After making some noise the chef came out of the kitchen; he understood some English and told I could get a replacement without paying again.
Me: “Which dish will you get for me?”He: “Vegetarian.”
Finally I got some cauliflower (in its purest vegetarian, read raw, form) and some fried (read oil-soaked) potatoes. I ate about 30% from my plate, then boiled MTR Poha (puffed rice) carried from home in the hot water obtained from the geyser-that-actually-worked-only-in-the-morning, and knew this was the end of trying out my luck at the hotel (apart from breakfast). On the remaining days I mostly sticked to the long menu of a Chinese restaurant next door (147 dishes, 3 vegetarian), an occasional Pizza from the chilly-walk place, and my MTR Pohas cooked with the morning-only geyser.
However, one night we had a fine dinner at an Indian restaurant (where I again found that Indians have a much stronger digestive system, think spices); I tried some tasty soups with two new friends on a beautiful evening; and on the last day finally tried the national dish (which happens to be vegetarian) — Fried cheese:
As indicated before, Prague is perhaps the city with the most convenient public transport: You can just install an app and charge it with your card for a day (not expensive at all), get a barcode that is your ticket, and travel as you want in any tram, bus, metro, or train. Moreover, the city is very-well covered — you perhaps don’t need to walk more than a few hundred meters anywhere — you will have nicely maintained, well-timed, clean-and-safe public transport available at the blink of an eye. I had listed down a large number of places to visit, and divided them into two days: Day 1 and Day 2, for the Saturday and the Sunday.
If you followed me in America, you know that the first thing on my list in a city that has a zoo, has to be a zoo. So Saturday began with visiting one of the best places hosting animals in the world: The Prague Zoo. Unlike the Zoo at Washington DC, at Prague you are welcomed with the star cast quite near to the entrance:
I spent nearly 3 hours at the zoo, walking about 8 kilometers inside, and ended with a team of as-tall-as-can-get Giraffes, and as-cute-as-can-get Penguins:
The next stop was The Old Town across Charles bridge (challenge: find the river in the lab-view above). Old Town has several attractions from the times Czechia was part of the Soviet Union, with several churches and castles at every turn. While the Prague Castle reminds one of Hogwarts, the Astronomical Clock attracts a huge crowd every hour for witnessing one of the many scientific marvels associated with the same (read more on Wikipedia):
Charles Bridge is a heritage on its own, with so many activities and picture-spots around that you can spend hours walking across and yet find something every time you cross! A beautiful view of the colorful city follows:
I finished traversing the Old Town by filling my bag at a shop full of candies (and forgetting the bag mid-way during my return journey)!
Having explored the crowded places the previous day, I decided to spend a solo Sunday climbing hills and exploring castles — both being rare opportunities in a vibrant city. The day was cold and hazy, but I walked and walked like crazy.
Vysehrad is an old castle in a bit far-off location, and should be traveled in broad day-light, is what I was told. Though the far-off part was true, I found the place full of people craving for silent time amidst the hustle and bustle of the cheerful city. You could sit there for hours with a book in hand, appreciating the rare greenery in the coldest of months.
The last I went was The Petrin Hill — reminiscent of the hikes I do around Mandi. I went up via a crowded rope-way and came down exploring solitary paths watching the city of hundred spires; as you descend, you realize every climb has its end, but the walk downhill doesn’t necessarily take you down.
If you ever visit Prague, do roam around the colorful streets, but take a moment walking up/down the Petrin Hill, sitting on that bench I couldn’t, and wondering “what to eat next” :-)
I returned back via Warsaw; the trip was prepended with a day’s stay with an about-to-be-engaged friend at New Delhi, and appended with a trip to Kolkata — a city where you drive ahead with both the legs on breaks (for preserving its classical past) — to attend the engagement of the same (more about my old-and-gold friends some time later!).
The series had promised an article every few weeks: it started swiftly, but has been going on rather slow. For me, the year 2020 has been full of remembering (read missing) the travels from 2019, and avid readers are in for many more write-ups. For now, an assurance is to have a few more articles than those promised in the intro A Traveling Year, one of them being exclusively on the rather long airport stays and flight journeys (of course with feedback on the food) I have had in the travel-rich year! So keep reading, and stay on…

I’m leaving the hotel bright and early and as I’m about to pack up I detected the quintessential bible that ever hotel ought to have (not!!!), only that here they had a rather unusual version of it.
I then stopped at a local bakery where I had the weakest coffee ever. I think I just don’t know how to (or rather what to) order. This actually begs the question: How much of a language is it courtesy to learn when visiting a country where one doesn’t speak the language? I understand zero Czech and here in the countryside the folks don’t tend to speak English. Maybe I should’ve tried German? After all, the city of Litoměřice — where I spent the night — was once part of the “Province of German Bohemia” and the town actually still has a German name: Leitmeritz. Well, I didn’t end up learning any Czech here at this bakery and instead made myself understandable with pointing at various items in the display case.
After breakfast, I hit the road. As I was passing the train station I saw a cool structure: a bike tower. I guess it’s for the folks commuting by train to work? This part of the country is certainly set up for cycling, with the Elbe-Labe Cycling Path probably contributing considerably to the local community. Later, I saw another cycle-friendly piece of infrastructure: a solar-powered charging station for e-bike.
Today’s first section of the route continued taking me along the river Elbe. As it was still rather early in the day, I saw a lot of fisherman sitting by the river and waiting for fish to latch on. There were so many of them and all of them men. I was wondering: How come women don’t do fishing? Seems like a relaxing activity. Maybe because they need to do the housework and tend to the kids while the men are frolicking their hobby?
On a similarly gender-related note, I noticed the below cycling path signs. Maybe someone would like to write a thesis on stereotypes in (modern) street signage? Questions that come to mind: Who still wears a hat like this? Do men really have the time to walk their daughters to school? Aren’t they too busy fishing? Discuss.
What I noticed since entering Czechia is that the Elbe here has several dams and so instead of a river, it often looks more like a lake. At one point today, I crossed one of these dams/locks and there were quite a few things to see.
Just like yesterday, I had the option to do a shortcut and arrive in Prague much faster: As rivers tend to meander, you can choose to go a straighter route. I decided to not be straight and instead follow the river path, which added a good 30km. I did this, because one of the highlights along the route was the river mouth where the Vltava (Moldau) and merges into the Labe (Elbe).
By the time I hit Mělník, I have to admit that I was starting to get tired. The next opportunity for food was not for another 25km and I was getting hungry. I stopped at a little convenience store to buy some fruits and water and that tied me over. The wind picked up and at some point I was cycling underneath a big dark cloud, which at eventually unloaded in a swift shower. I quickly found shelter underneath a tree, with view of a lovely castle.
Eventually, I arrived in an industrial-looking town and at the big roundabout I had a fundamental decision to make: Where should I buy my lunch from? The Lidl or the Tesco? Or, in other words: Supporting a German or British corporation? You can ask me next time you see me, which team I voted for. In any case, my fancy lunch consisted of two slices of pepperoni pizza and a sweet roll…all eaten at the back of the large supermarket building next to some vagabonds.
Then came the exciting part of the day and it literally elevated my heart rate: at some point my bike app showed me to cut through some forest area instead of following the river. Upon investigation, I saw that the stretch along the river was deemed “dangerous” by some cyclists. But the reckless person I am, I decided to choose the perilous option. Well, let’s just say this: I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, unless you have a mountain bike and like the thrill of cycling dangerously close to a cliff. To calm my nerves, I was humming the melody of Smetana’s Die Moldau, which was only fitting as I was cycling along its shores…
Since I’d sweated so much during this last stretch and since my destination for the day was in relatively close proximity, I decided to sit down at one of the very popular riverside kiosks for a glass of refreshing beer. What a great decision!
Eventually I arrived at the campsite and luckily they still had a space for me. The campground is just outside Prague city center and conveniently located next to a tram stop. After I’d set up camp, I took said mode of transport instead of my bike and ventured into the city.
Honestly, I was quite knackered and knew it wouldn’t be a night of partying. But, I wanted to enjoy a good meal and so I consulted Yelp and followed the recommendations for a restaurant called Vinohradský Parlament. It’s a beautiful restaurant and the waiter was fantastic. He recommended a hearty meal for me as I was telling him that I’d just cycled 100km and was rather famished. Their specialty are Czech dumplings (knedlíky) and this pillowy soft delicacy was perfect to soak up the juices that came with my beef roulade. For dessert, I had another kind of dumpling: this one stuffed with fresh blueberries! Yummy!
Afterwards, I was so tired that — after a brief wander around the city — I got back on the tram to my tent.

On the night of 20–21 August 1968, Soviet troops appeared in Czechoslovakia and on the streets of Prague to quell the growing movement of liberalisation, a movement known as the ‘Prague Spring’. Here, we summarize the events of the Prague Spring, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and its aftermath.
Socialism with a Human Face
On 5 January 1968, amongst growing discontent of economic failure, the Czechoslovakian communist party appointed Alexander Dubcek as its new chairman. Dubcek promised reform, democratisation and, using Nikita Khrushchev‘s phrase, ‘socialism with a human face’. He eased press censorship, allowed greater artistic and cultural freedom, pardoned victims of political purges, eased travel restrictions, promised to guarantee civil rights and liberties and permitted a degree of democratic reform.
But while urging democratic communism, Dubcek remained loyal to Moscow and at no point was he advocating the dismissal of his or the country’s socialist principles. The Soviet leadership, under Leonid Brezhnev (pictured), saw it otherwise, becoming increasingly concerned with what they considered Dubcek’s treachery and Czechoslovakia’s counterrevolution.
Evidence of the transformation was immediately apparent — young men grew their hair, women wore mini skirts, anti-state newspapers appeared, films and plays long since banned by the regime reappeared, including the work of dissident playright, Vaclav Havel.
In July 1968, Brezhnev, fearing Czechoslovakian independence, met with Dubcek and demanded that he re-imposed strict communist control over his people and ordered Dubcek to reign in his ‘counter-revolutionary’ methods. Dubcek promised to compromise but over the coming weeks, it came clear to Moscow that nothing was being done. Brezhnev applied greater pressure, often ringing Dubcek and bellowing at him down the telephone.
Soviet Invasion
Meeting on 15 August, the politburo decided that enough was enough. Dubcek’s failure to bring Czechoslovakia back in line angered the Soviet Union, and on 20 August 1968, Brezhnev, with support from other Warsaw Pact leaders, ordered in the tanks. The politburo arranged it so that loyal members of the Czechoslovakian government requested Soviet help in dealing with the counterrevolutionary threat. The politburo did not want to appear asoccupiers but merely responding to pleas for help.
Half a million Soviet troops (including token numbers from Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and Poland) and 2,000 tanks moved in quickly, taking control of Prague’s airport and vital points of communication before making a forceful presence on the streets of the capital. Dubcek told his people not to resist. But if the Soviet soldier expected a warm welcome by the good people of Czechoslovakia, as Moscow had told them, they were soon disabused of the idea as Czechoslovakian youths threw stones at their tanks. But faced with such a show of strength, unarmed resistance, limited as it was, soon crumbled. Eleven Soviet soldiers and 72 civilians were killed.
‘You have let us all down’
Dubcek (pictured), rendered powerless, was, along with his immediate colleagues, arrested at gun point, hit with a rifle butt and bundled unceremoniously into an aeroplane and taken to Moscow. In Moscow, Brezhnev, with tears in his eyes, shouted at Dubcek, ‘I trusted you,’ he said, ‘you have let us all down.’
Dubcek and colleagues were forced into signing declarations of renewed loyalty to Moscow. He was returned to office in Prague, his work carefully censured. Within the year, however, he was removed from power and exiled to a minor post, first as ambassador to Turkey, then further still as a forestry inspector in Bratislava. He was replaced by Gustav Husak, a man more loyal to Moscow and devoted to the socialist cause. Czechoslovakia’s brief flirtation with reform and democracy, its Prague Spring, was over.
Husak immediately reversed Dubcek’s reforms, rid the party of its more liberal members, and imposed greater authoritarian control over the country, a process referred to as ‘normalization’. (Husak was to remain in power until the collapse of Czechoslovakia in December 1989.)
Brezhnev Doctrine
Brezhnev, in a speech in November 1968, reiterated the right of the Warsaw Pact to intervene if any Soviet satellite compromised the hegemony of the Eastern bloc by looking West. Known as the ‘Brezhnev Doctrine’, it ushered in another period of suppression, and the straitjacking of the arts and ideological strictness.
The writers and artists that led the cultural revolution of the Prague Spring had their works banned. Members of a dissident group, Charter 77, including Vaclav Havel, were imprisoned. A fan of The Beatles, Havel said he was not so much a Leninist as a Lennonist.
The Soviet invasion prompted, within the Soviet Union, the first open demonstration in its history — on 25 August 1968, several Russians demonstrated on Moscow’s Red Square, shouting ‘Shame on invaders!’ and ‘Long live the free and independent Czechoslovakia!’ The demo lasted but a few minutes but it was a start.
In Czechoslovakia also, there were minor protests against the re-imposition of authoritarian rule, most notably on 16 January 1969 when a student, Jan Palach, set himself on fire in Prague’s Wenceslas Square. Palach was to die of his injuries three days later.

Prague seemed like the wisest choice for my next destination, given they were still on the Koruna (information I acquired from the ladies in Paris). They had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
I didn’t know much about Prague, other than that my friend, Kevin, told me I needed to go because “you can get wasted there for 5 bucks.” That was enough for me. Kevin always knows what he’s talking about. The only problem was the overnight, 14-hour train ride. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to romp. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost 8 Euros/night (about $10 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be two and a half hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand clocks? What the fuck are we doing here? Come on.
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were burned and shit on. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was me and a few other people, who I assume also couldn’t tell time.
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple more baguettes and a bunch of bananas (I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them), to supplement the Adderall I was going to take once the ride began. There’s nothing like Adderall when you need to kill 14 hours. Shit, you could stare at a clock for the entire time and still enjoy it. At least that’s how the drug made me feel.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, laying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
“I’ll be right back,” I told them.
I went to the bar cart and asked for four cups. Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they receive their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all loose as geese. We took turns telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed. Words, as usual, were unnecessary.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; 4 guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dark thoughts. Anything to avoid thinking about my dad.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train. Or maybe it was the second transfer I screwed up; I can’t remember. Either way, I ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like I was in Prague, the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of smoking and walking around, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel”. They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was? Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis in it and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. Without their kindness, I would have had to spend another night on a train station floor. I wanted to thank them, to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me, in what I assumed was Czech, for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics (only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad). When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Never comment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in a foreign country at two in the morning. It’s best to just listen and agree, then form your opinions later.
When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon. It was my grandfather’s name, and he was a miserable, racist old bastard. One time he told me he didn’t want my Indian friend, Naveen, over at the house because he, “wreaked of curry.” I used to pray for him to die. And when he did, I helped myself to his collection of Member’s Only jackets.
Irish Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: “How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.”
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday”. The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX.
She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was beautiful, but she didn’t flash it often. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. I can always spot a fellow speed freak. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a walk until the bars opened. For better or worse, I was now a part of a crew.
I slept like a drunken baby until noon the next day. When I came down to the common area, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. I was impressed, even turned on. She was motherly as well, a quality that inherently attracts me. I appreciated the way she made sure everyone was fed, before eating herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Hostel mom. All hostels had one, but like in life, many of them stink.
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. Its so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class American people wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had the whole two floor almost all to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happens in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were on a date.
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: Johnny… The umpire has the final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way there. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick. “Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular. Some might not have liked it, but I sure did. It reminded me of a Day’s Inn conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar, that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer. When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We up pulled seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked them over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on we were all best friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid, onto the table. I know moonshine when I see it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could stand. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others laughed. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech radio music, and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling.
Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that, and we stumbled home.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching. Every time we got close, he would scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar. We drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day, at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So, why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: I’m running.
Caroline: From what?
Me: Myself. Since my dad died, I feel like I can’t stop. If I do, I’ll have time to think. And I don’t want to think.
Caroline. I understand.
Me: Why are you here?
Caroline: Same reason, really. My younger brother died last year. When I’m home in Perth, I can’t get him out of my mind. He died in a car accident, along with our dogs.
Me: That’s terrible.
Caroline: How about we run together?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I heard Bratislava was nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t. Tomorrow we can take a bus. It’s a short ride.
By the time I got up the next morning, Simon had already weaseled his way into our plans. During breakfast, Caroline gave me a look as if to apologize. I couldn’t be upset though; Simon was a persistent one, I would have given in too.
Simon: Let me get some more of that speed. That was good shit.
Me: Goddamn you, Simon.
I gave him the 10mg pill, which he took immediately, in front of everyone.
Simon: Hey Johnny, we’re going to get pissed today, aren’t we?
Me: You just watch yourself, Ok? And please, don’t open any more beers with your mouth. It makes me sick.
It was only a 2-hour ride from Prague to Bratislava, but that didn’t deter Simon from bringing along a whole case of beer. He bought it though, and carried it, so I didn’t complain. Plus, it was nice to get some reciprocation after getting him high with my good Amsterdam weed for the past two days. The beer was the only luggage he took. I didn’t ask if he had more clothes, or any belongings at all, but I was curious. Best not to ask questions you don’t want the answers to.
He was 2 beers deep before we even boarded. With each one, he’d covertly pop the cap off then put it back on, before pretending to open it with his teeth, giving me a childish look in the process. At that point I’d stopped caring, but he wouldn’t let it go. He was an instigator that way. I’ve never understood why some people show affection by teasing. You can only pull off teasing if you’re funny and have tact. Otherwise, you just sound like an annoying asshole. Timing is everything.
Caroline and I sat next to each other, while Simon sat behind us. He smelled like he hadn’t showered in a week, and he probably hadn’t. When the metal chains on his leather jacket clanged against the poor old woman sitting beside him, she clutched her bag and turned towards the window. I felt terrible for her, having to sit next to a drunken stink bomb like that for 2 hours. He was disgusting.
Speaking of disgusting… I was always embarrassed when my dad and I went out in public together. He was impossible not to stare at because of how fat and unkempt he was. And I was his son, so I got stares too. Food is the worst drug in that way. Most addictions aren’t noticeable to the naked eye, but with food, there’s no way to hide it, unless you purge. My mom always told me that everyone is too caught up in their own lives to notice other people’s insecurities, but I never believed her. I knew they were looking, wondering how a child like me could come from a man like that. I could feel their indictments of him as a father; I could feel their pity. I felt it all. Those feelings have never left me, even long after his death. I can still feel those eyeballs on me.
It was a peaceful first hour. Caroline and I read from our books while knocking knees. The unspoken intimacy was lovely. She was on her second read of a Virginia Woolf book I can’t remember the name of, just like I was on my second read of my Hunter Thompson book. We both sipped our beers and enjoyed the nice cross breeze wisping through the bus. The sun was out, and we were in just the right place at just the right time.
With only about 15 minutes left in the ride, I reached back to grab another beer from the box on Simon’s lap. That’s when I saw the flashing lights behind us. It was a police van, and it was rapidly approaching. When it got closer it became clear that we were the ones being pulled over.
Me: Uh, what the fuck is going on?”
Simon: It’s usually just standard shite. Don’t worry.
Me: Usually?!
Several police officers boarded the bus, all of whom were holding automatic rifles and looking very serious. I swear, in Europe everyone with even a modicum of authority gets a machine gun. They went around checking passports. When they got to me, I was terrified. My bag and pockets were filled with weed, hash, and a bunch of loose Adderall pills. Also, I was American. Being an American in Europe is almost as bad as being black in America. Boy, being black in Europe must be double awful.
I handed the cop my passport, and instead of handing it back, he put it in his pocket and escorted me off the bus. I was the only one singled out. Everyone else just sat comfortably, drinking their beers. The jig was finally up, and my worst nightmare was coming true. “If this is what happens in the movie Hostel, I’m going to kill Caroline for not warning me,” I thought to myself.
He asked me a bunch of questions that I obviously didn’t understand, while repeatedly checking my passport and shaking his head from side to side. It was like I was being questioned by a squirrel. I had no clue what he wanted from me or how I could appease him. I tried to look like an upstanding gentleman by buttoning up my cardigan and straightening my posture, but it didn’t seem to be working. He saw right through me.
I could see Simon in the window of the bus. He was giving me the international sign for throat-slashing. I wasn’t sure if he was implying that I should kill myself to avoid Slovakian prison, or if he was telling me I should find a way to slit the officer’s throat and escape. Probably the latter, knowing him. Caroline too had come to the window. I could see the concern on her face. If she was scared, I knew I was in trouble.
They had me out on the side of the road for ten agonizing minutes while they talked on their radios. The bus driver came out at one point to ask what the holdup was, and they swiftly sent him back on the bus. Now, everyone was concerned. I got Caroline’s attention through the window.
Me: Caroline, grab a pen… My name is Sam Rosenberg, NOT John McEnroe. My mom’s name is Audrey. She lives in Northbrook, Illinois. Please tell her —
Then, it all ended, just like that. No bag check, no pat down, no nothing. They just sent me on my not so merry way, with my passport. The bus driver gave me a snide look, like I’d messed up his schedule, but I didn’t care. I’d dodged another bullet. Simon opened a beer with his teeth and handed it to me.
Simon: This deserves a celebration.
Our hostel wasn’t the most fashionable, but it was cheap, and right downtown. The room fit 8 people. It was the three of us and 5 Italian guys who were all clearly friends. When we got to the room, they were eating spaghetti with their shirts off. It was wildly apropos. When they offered us each a bowl, Caroline and I politely declined. Simon, on the other hand, scarfed one down in less than a minute.
Simon: You call this pasta? It’s shite, mate. Sorry to tell you.
They didn’t understand.
Italian Guy: Si, pasta. Prego, prego.
Me: Prego?
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Caroline: (understanding the double entendre) Not the brand, Sam.
Simon: Ahem, his name is Johnny.
Caroline: It means “you’re welcome.”
Me: Ah, grazie.
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Right down the street from our hostel was a bar called The Dubliner. It looked exactly like you’d expect it to look. There’s no need to even describe it. Irish bars are perfect that way, you always get what you expect, regardless of the country you’re in. The food and liquor are the same, as is the décor. They are, if nothing else, reliable. And reliability is everything.
Caroline and I sat at a table together, drinking Guinness, while Simon roamed around the bar swilling Jameson and accosting random strangers. “I’m here with John McEnroe!” he’d tell anyone who’d listen. He was blacked out. 12 beers in 2 hours will do that to you.
Simon got punched in the face and thrown out within an hour. I didn’t see it but apparently, he spit in some guy’s face after being called a cunt. Then thee guy decked him with a single punch. As someone who used the word so often, I’d expect Simon to be less sensitive to being called one himself. Caroline and I were tossed too because we came with him. He tried fighting every single person on the way out, but Caroline and I just stood there and watched. There was no way I was fighting on his behalf. The last time I did that was in 4th grade when a friend got jumped for using a racial slur. I have regretted it ever since and still think of the guy as a racist piece of shit.
When the hullabaloo concluded, Simon’s face was bloodied, but he still wanted to drink.
Me: You need to go back to the hostel. They won’t let you into a bar with blood all over your face and shirt. That’s surely a universal rule.
Simon: Fuck that. When someone in Dublin gets punched in the face, the bar buys them drinks.
Me: We are not in Dublin.
Caroline: Sam and I are going to eat. You can’t come. You need to rest.
To my amazement, Simon heeded her advice and stumbled back to the hostel to crash. I felt sorry for the Italians because I knew he’d finish their spaghetti and/or try to fight them. At least it was five against one, and Simon could hardly stand, so I wasn’t too worried about them.
Caroline and I set out to find the nicest restaurant we could. We’d both been skimping on money for weeks and finally wanted to splurge now that we were amongst good company. We walked around for half an hour holding hands, chatting about food. Caroline told me she used to cook for her late brother, “Damby,” as she called him (because she couldn’t say “Danny” when she was little). She’d make him minced meat pies on Sundays after church. They were his favorite, and he’d eat them inside-out, saving the crust for last (I do the same). The recipe came from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother before her.
I told her about my Bubbie, and the fried latkes she’d make for me after school. I always thought the jelly would cool them down faster, but it really just cooled the exterior, lulling me into a burnt mouth. I never learned my lesson. We traded food story after food story, our faces lit up, until we had none left.
Food is the easiest way to make bonds, Bourdain taught me that, and I’ve always found it to be true. We all eat.
Downtown Bratislava was way more beautiful than I’d expected. The streets were cobblestone, but the buildings were modern; a dichotomy that somehow worked. It perfectly combined the old world with the new. And the place oozed romanticism. It was like a poem come to life. Everything Disneyland claims to be, Bratislava actually was. If you’re proposing to someone, I suggest doing it there. You will no doubt get a “yes.”
We found a white-tablecloth, French restaurant to dine in. They didn’t seem to care about our casual attire even though the place was fancy, which impressed me. Everyone who can afford a meal should be accommodated, regardless of their attire. Miss me with that classist shit. Before ordering we decided we’d share so we could try more dishes. We got escargot to start. Always start with escargot if they have it. Then we had an omelet, followed by a quiche. For our main courses we shared duck confit and beef bourguignon. Everything was insanely good, like eyes rolling back and moaning good. The price didn’t matter, though they were on the Krona too, so it only came out to what amounted to $40 USD.
We were enveloped in each other that night. The vibes were electric. We flirted and teased, properly, on the walk back. We were about to enter the hostel, when Caroline grabbed my arm.
Caroline: Do you have a girlfriend?
Me: No. Do you have a boyfriend?
Caroline: No.
I knew an opportunity when I saw one, so I leaned in and gave her a kiss.
Caroline: (Pulling away) Just kidding, I do.
Me: What?!
Caroline: Haha, you should see your face.
Me: Why did you do that?
Caroline: To fuck with you.
Me: I don’t appreciate that.
Caroline: (mockingly) I’m Sam, and I don’t appreciate jokes even though I was a comedian. Shut up and kiss me again, you sensitive man you.
I kissed her again, this time pulling her close.
Me: Whoa, that was awesome. Let’s do that more.
I usually say some very awkward shit during and after moments of passion. It’s like the side effect I get from a boner is Tourette’s. I’ve been known to say “thank you” after I cum. It’s not something I’m proud of.
Caroline: I have an idea… How about we go somewhere else, without Simon, and pretend to be a couple? Like, just for a few days. We can go our separate ways after that.
Me: I dig that. But how are we going to get rid of Simon?
Caroline: Leave that up to me.
We made out for a few more minutes before going upstairs. Simon was still passed out, and the Italian guys weren’t back yet, so we laid in my bunk and dry humped quietly for a little while. Part of me couldn’t believe I was hooking up with such an awesome chick, but the other part wished it was Meghan. I kept my mouth shut, as to not ruin our moment, but I felt guilty, like I was using her. Before going to bed, I wrote in my journal:
Why are you like this? Who are you trying to spare in this situation? You’re not even dating Meghan, and Caroline REALLY likes you. You don’t have to be in love with her to have some fun. I mean, you just had sex with a prostitute, how is this worse than that? Ignore your silly morals for once and take a chance. Put yourself out there. Meghan would want you to.
It was easier to ditch Simon than we’d expected because I’m pretty sure he had a concussion. I tried to wake him up a few times, because I knew you weren’t supposed to sleep in that situation, but he kept telling me to fuck off. Caroline finally had enough.
Caroline: Simon, Sam and I are leaving. We will say a prayer for you. Drink water and don’t look directly into bright lights for a few days.
Simon: You cunts. You’re going to leave me here, like this? Sam, I need more speed.
Me: No. And it’s Mr. McEnroe to you.
Caroline pulled me out of the room by my arm before we could hear any more of his pleading. I was insulted by everything Simon did, but that demand infuriated me. I wanted to go back in there and smother him with a pillow. I guess that’s what I get for always seeing the best in people, and for sharing my drugs. Friends like these, eh dude?
Caroline and I went right to the train stop after buying some candy for the trip. She loved the sour stuff. The sourer, the better. In my experience, sweet people like sour candy, and sour people like sweet candy. I’ve ran the numbers, trust me. We didn’t know where to go, so we looked at a map on the wall.
Me: So where to ma’am?
Caroline: Why don’t you just close your eyes and point?
Without waiting for my response, she got behind me and covered my eyes. Then, she spun me around a few times, before placing me back in front of the map. I pointed to a spot.
Caroline: I hear Vienna is nice.

Well, they say! Home is where our heart is. I left a small part of my heart at the golden hour over the Charles Bridge.
With the busy life we all have, traveling is the place where you destress. Life with a toddler is never easy. I started to rethink the concept of traveling after my child was born.
Sigh! With the doubts and rethinking, we finally started planning our travel to open our summer in Europe. Springs are really special in Europe. That is when you still can’t find many tourists in the beautiful cities.
Luckily we started this whole trip with the right planning. We thought to make a fun road trip through the Autobahn. We live in the beautiful city of Utrecht province, and all our planning was around this.
Riding through the autobahn and landscapes of Germany, we were entertained well and our heart was calm. After a long journey and our halts through cute stops in Germany, we finally reached Prague at nearly midnight.
Tiring ourselves through sitting, we just wanted to rest our heads on the pillow, but our little one wanted to swim. Through a lot of convincing, we had a good night’s sleep. My subconscious mind made me feel for a while, we were still driving in the car, but my tired eyes were not able to focus on thoughts and we slept.
Our next day started with a nice morning view of the city of Prague through the large side windows of our hotel room.
Pro tip: Try to find a hotel where, your little one can enjoy amenities and activities like swimming, playroom, or lawn. This keeps them happy through the day and grownups can have a stroll.
After a great breakfast and swim, we finally started exploring Prague.
Our first stop was at the Prague castle complex, where we walked and witnessed the glorious monuments of St. Vitus Cathedral, a former royal palace, and other museums. The collection of views of the cities was breathtaking. One could also visit Golden Lane in the same complex. Never forget to click a picture here, just a great way to summarise your castle tour.
Pro tip: Check for tickets at any information center in Prague city. There is only a collective ticket available for all the important monuments.
A modern bold building by Architect Vlado Milunić along with Frank Gehry. Originally it was named Ginger and Fred building after the dancers. The bold piece of art is in the middle of the busy street, otherwise on your way to the famous walking route of old Prague city and the famous bridges.
Walking down the 15th-century Golden Lane took us back to those days. This preserved street is just worth experiencing, as most of the fort is reconstructed to adapt to current days.
This was a cute short ride, which our little one enjoyed. The funicular is been in operation since 1891. During the season( Between Apr-May season) you can enjoy cherry blossoms and other beautiful trees on this hill. The hill also has an interesting observatory. But it is a good experience on a sunny day to walk down the hill with your little one
Pro tip: You can have public transport 24-hour tickets at the information center or on any tram/ bus itself. I would suggest watching the YouTube channel HONEST GUIDE. He spoke about everything a tourist needs in Prague to walk like a confident local
Our final destination…..🥁🥁🥁
We started from our nearest metro station and walked through the beautiful old town of Prague. Our important pit stop was to witness the oldest astronomical clock in the world which is dated back to 1410, at the old town square. What is it? one may ask. If it interests you further, Astronomical clock.
Taking our imagination of walking through the 18th century, we reached the arch of Charles Bridge. Magnificent as it is, it took us to an old world that is built over the Vltava River. The 30 Baroque statues welcomed us to witness the glory of history.
We were lucky enough to reach the bridge in the golden hour. That is when I fell in love with Prague. Romantic Prague! We witnessed a rainbow which made it the perfect end to our romantic walk. We witnessed the sun going down dancing into colorful narration.
Further, when the sun went down. The view into the castle and of the city was spectacular.
I hope you enjoyed my little narration and it helped you to plan your future trip to Prague or made you remember your best evening.
Thank you for reading!

Most people know Prague for its cheap beer and beautiful bridges, but did you know that the city has a blossoming art gallery scene, too?
Prague truly has something for everyone. Are you a fan of historical art? What about contemporary art? The city has it all — if you know where to look. But even if you don’t, don’t worry. That’s what this guide is for, after all!
Here’s a list of some of the best must-see galleries in Prague you can’t miss.
Fun fact: Prague’s National Gallery is one of the largest art museums in Central Europe. It has several buildings across the city. Honestly, if you want to see all of it, you might want to extend your trip by a couple of days! That’s how much art there is for you to admire.
Whether you’re interested in the old masters, Czech modernism, or international contemporary exhibitions, this gallery needs to be on your travel itinerary.
It’s a must-see for anyone who’s looking for a deep dive into Czech and European art.
I’ll admit — this one is a personal favorite of mine. There’s no better way to spend the afternoon in Prague than visiting DOX and seeing whatever exhibition they currently have on. They never miss!
DOX Centre for Contemporary Art is Prague’s leading modern art space. Here, you can expect thought-provoking exhibitions, modern architecture, and a permanent rooftop airship installation with some cozy beanbags inside.
It’s located in the Holešovice district, which is full of artistic cafés, beautiful plant stores, and small independent shops that you can get lost in. Perfect for an artsy day out!
This Prague art gallery is a must-see for contemporary art lovers.
Kampa Museum is all about modern European art. They especially spotlight Czech and Central European artists. Here, you can see the works of František Kupka and Otto Gutfreund, as well as other rotating exhibits.
This beautiful gallery also has an exciting location — you can find it on Kampa Island by the Vltava River. That’s right — it’s on an actual island. In the middle of mainland Europe!
If you’re looking for a unique setting with stunning views, this is the one for you.
MeetFactory is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. This contemporary gallery and artist residency was founded by David Černý, a famous Czech artist who also designed the famous Rotating Head of Franz Kafka.
MeetFactory is all about avant-garde exhibitions, live performances, and experimental installations. It’s perfect for edgier travelers who want to see something different.
If you’re interested in experiencing Prague’s alternative art scene, you really shouldn’t miss this one!
Schwarzenberg Palace is technically part of the National Gallery, but it definitely deserves its own spot on this list. It’s a beautiful place, which makes sense. After all, it’s actually a Baroque palace that was only later turned into an art gallery. Its highlights include Czech Baroque and Renaissance paintings and sculptures.
For its historical setting showcasing classic masterpieces, of course. Also, it’s near Prague Castle, another popular tourist destination — why not do a little 2-in-1?
Leica Art Gallery in Prague is a must-visit spot for photography lovers. It specializes in fine art photography by both Czech and international photographers. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, add this one to your itinerary. And don’t forget to check out the Leica camera store, too!
This one is a must for photography enthusiasts.
Last but not least, we have the Rudolfinum Gallery, which is a historic concert hall with a contemporary art gallery. It’s located by the Vltava River, near the Old Town, meaning that just walking there will take your breath away.
The Rudolfinum Gallery offers exhibitions of modern and contemporary art, despite how old and majestic it may look from the outside.
This gallery combines fine art with one of Prague’s most beautiful buildings. It also has a fun name. The Rudolfinum. Try not to think about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer while putting that name into Google Maps. I dare you.
The Rudolfinum is a gorgeous building, but it’s not the only one. Prague is a beautiful city with many views worth taking in. This is why river cruises are so popular here. If you want to see more of the city but don’t have a ton of time to walk everywhere, a cruise is the perfect solution.
You can try this Panoramic Vltava River Cruise by Get Your Guide, which will take you around Prague’s most famous landmarks, including Kampa Island, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and more.
Disclaimer: The above link is an affiliate link. If you choose to go on the cruise, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. No pressure, though!
In case it wasn’t obvious, Prague’s art scene is super diverse. Whether you’re a modern art enthusiast or a lover of the classics, you won’t be disappointed by checking out these gorgeous galleries. So, don’t forget to add them to your travel plans.
Which of these Prague art galleries will you visit first? Let me know in the comments!

My final destination in my post-graduation European trip was Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. There are many things to do in this city and I particularly like the variety in food, especially in meats. Duck, rabbit, deer, geese, and wild boar meat are quite common in restaurants throughout the city. From high-end restaurants to more casual dining places, Czech food offers a lot of variety. The Prague nightlife is also great, and I would sometimes have less time in the day to go sightseeing because I would return to my hotel late at night to catch up on sleep after an eventful evening.
One of the first places I visited in Prague was Prague Castle. The castle’s history dates back to 870, when it was first used as a church and a fort. The fort later became a medieval castle, and served as the residence of the Kings of Bohemia, the Holy Roman Emperors, the Presidents of Czechoslovakia, and currently it is the official office of the President of the Czech Republic.
Visiting Prague Castle was quite sentimental for me because I visited the castle when I was 15 and had fond memories of that visit. It was great to see it again and I had a sense of nostalgia walking around. Occasionally I would recognize something I remember from six years ago. Since the castle stands high upon a hill, I particularly enjoyed the great views of Prague while walking around the castle walls. Because of how large the castle…

This magical city of Prague! No other place can leave such a living memory. No other city looks at its visitors with such wonderful eyes. Prague is the city that can make you fall in love with it!
In this article, we are going to give you 5 most popular tourist tips for curious travelers. Slowly carrying out all the points and enjoying your trip, you will get the most complete impression of this wonderful city and its traditions.
Let’s start our unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague!
1. Walk along the Charles Bridge
Prague’s oldest bridge is built of sandstone blocks, flanked at each end by fortified towers (Lesser Town Bridge Towers, Old Town Bridge Tower). From 1683 to 1928, thirty statues of saints were carved to decorate the bridge, the most famous of which is the statue of St John of Nepomuk.
From the bridge, you will have amazing views over many Prague’s medieval towers, churches, and palaces. The view towards Lesser Town, dominated by the Prague Castle complex, is very picturesque.
The best time to visit Charles Bridge is early in the morning or at night when it is not crowded. You can climb two towers standing on both ends of the Bridge for a magnificent view of Prague and the bridge from above.
You can get to the Charles Bridge when taking the tram number 12, 20, 22 or 23, getting off at station Malostranse Namesti.
The Charles Bridge over the Vltava River is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Prague. Its towers and sculptures are worth to be seen!
2. Admire the architecture of Old Town Square and watch a unique Astronomical Clock performance
Wander through the Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí), where the true heart of Prague beats!
The elegant tower of the Old Town Hall with the world famous Astronomical Clock, the monumental Church of St. Nicholas and countless colorful houses of many styles give this place a unique atmosphere, which will mesmerize you if you decide to take a look at its charm.
Not avoiding a crowd of tourists, watch a performance on an Astronomical Clock at the Old Town Hall, called “The Apostle Parade”. Its main function was to depict the movement of the Sun and the Moon; showing the time was merely a secondary element. The Apostle figures became part of the clock in the middle of the 16th century.
Very much has been written about the performance itself, but nothing will convey that atmosphere of mystery and admiration that reigns over the square during this performance. For a greater impression during the presentation, be sure to remember that the clock was built in the 15th century and has not undergone any tangible changes since that time.
The Apostle parade can be seen on the Prague Astronomical Clock every hour on the hour from 9 a.m. till 11 p.m. However, it is better to watch it in the morning, when there are relatively few people on the square. To take the most advantageous place, come to the clock 15 minutes beforehand.
While walking along the historical center, try famous Czech trdelnik, a kind of spit cake, made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick and topped with sugar and walnuts. Here you can eat a fried sausage and drink Czech beer.
All this must be done by sitting on a free bench and enjoying the surrounding pictures. In winter, the beer can be replaced with hot mulled wine or grog.
3. Enjoy a classic performance in Prague National Theatre
The National Theatre in Prague belongs to the most important Czech cultural institutions with a rich artistic tradition. Today the National Theatre consists of three artistic ensembles — opera, ballet, and drama. Operas are sung mostly in Italian and are accompanied by both Czech and English subtitles.
Visit Giuseppe Verdi´s La Traviata and Aida, Camille Saint-Saens´ Samson and Dalila, or very popular Georges Bizet´s Carmen. If you want to see something by Czech authors, there is Bedrich Smetana´s Hubicka (The Kiss), Tajemstvi (The Secret), and famous Rusalka.
Another scene of the National Theater is the Estates Theater. On this stage, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart´s La Clemenza di Tito, Don Giovanni, La Nozze di Figaro, and The Magic Flute are staged.
If you prefer the Ballet, you can visit Adolphe Charles Adam´s Giselle or project Solo Pro tri (Solo for three).
Both of the buildings are very nice, performances are well prepared, done by the best Czech and world dancers and singers, prepared by great directors and choreographers. So if you like Opera or Ballet, it is worth to visit the National Theatre, as it can be a great cultural experience, and a way how to spend a pleasant evening in Prague.
Do you want to visit the smallest street in Prague and go inside these tiny houses?
4. Golden Lane or Zlatá ulička!
On the eastern side of the Prague Castle, not far from St. George’s Basilica, there is an unusual street called Zlatá ulička. It is considered a symbol of Prague, its historical heritage.
Colored facades of tiny houses emerge on the cobblestone pavement. Sixteen old buildings have survived here. Zlatá ulička itself is a kind of museum. In nine of them, there are mini-museums dedicated to the former inhabitants of the street. The rest are souvenir shops.
There is a legend that alchemists lived on this street, receiving elixirs of eternal youth, gold, and a philosopher’s stone for the Emperor.
In the house № 22 lived Franz Kafka; he worked here on the collection “The Village Doctor”. Now there is a bookshop in this building.
In the house № 14, marked with a sign depicting a cat, an owl, and a crystal ball, a fortune teller had her salon. Here is also a small house under № 27, once inhabited by a local healer. The house is filled with drugs and herbs, as befits a medieval pharmacy. A jeweler’s workshop can be viewed in the house № 15.
Try to find a house near the last lantern and ghosts of alchemists, prisoners of the White Tower and other former residents!
If you haven’t visited this magical street yet or missed it while being in Prague, I think now you are looking forward to making this destination your point number one.
Zlatá ulička is open every day 9:00–17:00. After 18:00 admission is free. But keep in mind that most souvenir shops are closed by this time.
How to get there? Go subway line A or tram 5, 12, 18, 20, 22 to the stop Malostranská.
5. Finally, climb the Petřín Hill and watch Prague from the Observation Tower
There are many parks and gardens in Prague, but we strongly recommend you to visit Petřín Hill as it offers a stunning view of the city’s red brick roofs.
Built as a mini version of Paris’s Eiffel Tower, the Petrin Observation Tower is 60m high. Climb 300 steps to reach the top of the tower, and the view over Prague is magnificent.
In the spring, hundreds of apples and cherries blossom there, filling the air with a heady aroma. Have a pleasant stroll around the rose garden.
Other attractions include an observatory, a museum, a telescope, a hall of mirrors, a church, and many nice cafes.
By the way, next to the Petřín Hill, there is the Kinský Garden (Zahrada Kinských). It is rather easy to go from one park to another, just find an arch in the wall that separates them. By the way, in the Kinský Garden, you can find the Transcarpathian ancient church.
Once you have enjoyed the views of Prague, we recommend you to have dinner in Nebozizek Restaurant near Petřín Hill. You can reach it on foot or by funicular.
To reach the Observation Tower at the top of Petřín Hill, take the Funicular Railway. It departs from Ujezd street in the Lesser Town (Malá Strana), near Ujezd tram stop.
I think now you must be ready for an amazing trip to Prague. We hope our recommendations for your unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague will be helpful and you will enjoy it!
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

My wife told me this yesterday:
“I was talking to an acquaintance, and she asked if I’d ever been to Prague? I said, ‘No, but my husband’s been twice and loved it.’ I haven’t been to Prague, right?”
“Well actually, you have. You and the girls and I went with my students on that trip from Berlin to Prague. We went to the Cathedral across the river (the Vlatava) and crossed the Charles bridge on the way back. Don’t you remember how cold it was that day? The wind was killing us and our guide took the most crowded route at the busiest time of the day. And one of my students was sick and gave me her cold, remember?”
“Oh, now it’s coming back to me.”
Don’t worry. My wife’s mind is full of tasks and Buddhist philosophy, and special guides to help her family and friends, not to mention all the people she serves as their trusted therapist and whatever issues they might have. She hasn’t fogotten all the trips she’s made in our lives, but because of this slip, she asked me and her sister to help her remember all the places she has been to. We’ve done so, and it’s truly an impressive list, even if I don’t want to remember, or want her to remember, that fated trip to Hawaii she took not long after our trip to Prague.

The night the avant-garde German theater group performed at the Roxy Klub in Prague between the sets I was DJing, I knew it would get weird.
When the troupe lit an explosive, and it went off in the center of the dance floor, it caused several chunks of the plaster ceiling to rain down on the heads of the audience. After my ears stopped ringing, I cued up a song and spun some Groove Collective. Dancers filled the dance floor, gyrating around the hole left in the old cement floor by the performance artists’ dynamite.
It was another Saturday night at the Roxy in 1995.
I moved to the Czech Republic in January and was enrolled as a student at Karlova Univerzita in the mass communications department. Rather than go to class, I’d hang out with my professor, Cyril, who discovered that I was a musician and that I loved literature. He introduced me to the gang at Yazzyk Magazine.
Yazzyk was a periodical specializing in publishing East European authors and poets translated into English. It was run by a Canadian named Douglas and a Mexican-American named Tony. They hired me to be in charge of…

Athens, Vienna, & Prague
March 3rd & March 10th, 2025
Apologies, it’s been some time since my last words!
For the past two weeks, I have either been prepping for travel or have actually been moving, traveling to different countries!
March 3rd
Beginning with the long week of March 3rd, the week started off quite well, with lots on my mind, trying to prep for an absence of almost three weeks total. My flight leaving Portsmouth was on Thursday, March 6th, so I knew for the days leading up to it, I had lots to do, from getting schoolwork done before leaving, to cleaning my room and emptying my fridge, to also doing laundry and packing (which wasn’t too difficult as I’m only allowed one backpack for my budget flight ticket — which I realized after finishing my trip, I quite literally was able to do the infamous saying of “backpacking through Europe”!).
So after the somewhat stressful couple of days leading up to the trip was over, I finally was able to focus on the fun of the planning my friend Celeste and I had spent much time doing! Our first flight was to Athens, where we would stay for four nights. The flight was truthfully not the best, even though it was only four hours, it felt as if it took ages to land, thanks to the kid behind me kicking my seat, but nevertheless, we were landing in Athens, Greece, so what is there to complain about!
After figuring out how to get from the airport to the city center, we finally arrived in our (super) cozy hotel room! You’ll see why the room is so cozy in the pictures below, the bed frame was the length of the wall, haha! It was a funny encounter and experience, but it truly made our trip that much funnier and more of a memorable time 😁.
After settling into our room, it was quite late at night so we grabbed some quick food and then went to bed for our first night in Athens!
The next couple of days in Athens consisted of absolutely dreamy beautiful weather, with amazing food smells on every corner and glowing skin from the refreshing glistening Mediterranean sun. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Athens and wish I had more time to spend in the beautiful city, but I told myself it’s okay and that I would certainly make a return sometime in the future, hopefully sooner rather than later!
Some highlights of the trip were seeing the famous Ancient Greek ruins, such as the Acropolis and Parthenon, as well as visiting the waterfront, watching the sun set on the beautiful Mediterranean waters. Celeste and I were also able to meet one of our friends from Portsmouth in Athens to celebrate her birthday! We spent the day strolling throughout the beautiful city, eating delicious Greek cuisine and ending the night in a gorgeous rooftop bar with truly spectacular views of the Acropolis! Some things are better shown through pictures, so I’ll let the following pictures do the rest of explaining for our activities in Athens!
There was one other highlight of the trip that I can’t not mention, and that is Celeste and I’s encounter of a protest on a random street in Athens. So, quick story time:
It all started when Celeste and I wanted to watch the sunset on a beach along the coast of the city. The city center of Athens is actually quite far by foot to the coasts of the city, so we decided to take a bus to get us to the beach in a much easier and timely manner. Little did we know though that our innocent selves, waiting at the bus stop for a ride to the beach, would become witnesses to a quite significant protest in the city. It was a random Saturday in March on a random street in Athens in the middle of the afternoon when Celeste and I were waiting at the bus stop, watching numerous cars and buses pass by us, when all of a sudden the traffic passing by, stopped. All of a sudden, came a line of protestors holding a banner and chanting, and they entered the wide road and overtook the street. It began with quite a peaceful protest, simply walking together, united as one to fight for the cause they believed in, but within a matter of seconds, the protests escalated to another level. After long stretches of calm and peaceful protestors passed by, following just behind them was another group of protestors, but they were noticeably a different group of protestors. These young-adult looking individuals dressed in all black, covering their faces with black masks to hide their identities, came in strong after the peaceful protestors, making loud banging noises from the sledgehammers they had brought to damage public properties such as dumpsters, glass bus stops, and ATM stations. They further began to drag numerous dumpsters to the middle of the road and started fires in each dumpster… This all happened in a matter of seconds, right in front of us. Celarly, Celeste and I were quite shocked at what was happening, an experience that will truly be unforgettable for the rest of our lives. To make the experience even more memorable, out of natural instinct, we had our phones out and were taking pictures and videos of what was unfolding in front of us, but one of the young-adults in black noticed this and came up to my friend Celeste. She had been recording one of his comrades breaking an ATM with his sledgehammer, and immediately was telling her to delete the video. It was quite a heated yet calm interaction, as the boy seemed he just wanted to make sure there was no footage of them and their acts that could circulate throughout social media, is my presumption. So, after that quite stunning experience of a young man in black coming up to us and demanding us to delete a video, we realized that this definitely could escalate to a more dangerous situation. But, as I had mentioned, everything happened within a matter of seconds because shortly after that encounter, came a whole line of police troops dressed in army gear with gas masks and blockade shields, passing by us and heading towards the whole crowd of protestors. At that point, most of the protestors had made their way down the streets, so Celeste and I were luckily quite far from the protestors when we heard a loud popping noise and smoke erupt into the air from the presumed tear gas that the army had deployed at the protestors. We presumed tear gas because after the protest had settled, some protestors were pouring baby powder on their faces and eyes.
Ultimately, this once-in-a-lifetime experience was quite shocking and felt as if we were in a movie scene, casually waiting for a bus to take us to the beach, but ending in a deserted road, filled with dumpsters scattered across the streets with fire burning inside them, and papers flying in the winds from the protestors’ flyers thrown as they were chanting and walking down the streets of Athens. On the bright side though, we were completely safe, and truthfully I never felt a serious fear for my well-being, which is surprising, considering I tend to have quite an over-thinker paranoid mind. Also, after much troubleshooting of trying to find another bus and route to take us to the beach, we were able to end the day by watching the sun fall down onto the Mediterranean waters, a truly beautiful image that will also be a sight to remember!
March 10th
Moving onto our next journey, on March 10th, Celeste and I left our friend in Athens and met up with another one of our friends from Portsmouth in Vienna! We luckily found flight times that arrived in Vienna within an hour of each other so we were able to meet and reunite in the airport! From there, we figured out how to get to our accommodation, which was a nice and spacious apartment that was actually quite affordable after splitting the cost!
It was all our first time in Vienna so we were all super excited to explore the beautiful city, which began with the hunt for late-night food… food is always priority! 😄 After finding some delicious food, we walked back to our place and went to bed, ready to venture into the city, and also meet one of my friends studying in Vienna the following day!
The weather treated us quite well I’d say during our time there, which apparently, nice blue skies and wind-less spring temperature is not the regular weather in Vienna, so I guess we got lucky! Our two-day trip in Vienna essentially consisted of us three girls walking around, looking at famous landmarks while talking and sharing memorable moments, stopping at cafés and grabbing dinners to further enjoy ourselves and our time traveling together. It was truly an enjoyable time with my two friends, and I was fortunate enough to also meet up with another friend of mine who is currently living in Vienna for her studies! I met her during my working position at UNO as a Student Ambassador, so I was quite excited to meet back up with her, and in Vienna of all places!
After a few fun days of taste-testing Vienna’s most famous treats and venturing the streets of the beautiful city, a city I could definitely see myself coming back to, we packed our bags and got ready for our next journey to Prague!
Two days after Vienna, on March 13th, we took a train from Vienna to Prague which was quite short and enjoyable, and we got an interesting seating booth for the train, something I’ve never experienced before! In Prague, we had a similar agenda to Vienna, simply walking and exploring the city, enjoying our time together while also seeing the beautiful Historic European architecture of the city. In Prague, I was again fortunate to meet up with another friend who is currently studying in Brno, Czechia, a city not too far from Prague! She is a fellow student from UNO who is also on an exchange program, and we actually met through a previous study abroad experience at UNO a couple years ago! So, we got in touch and were able to meet in Prague for the day and explore the city together!
Prague was the farthest East country I’ve travelled to in Europe, and it was quite enjoyable up until an unfortunate circumstance occurred on our last day in Prague… but, we’ll address that later!
Overall, Prague as a city is quite enjoyable and has many beautiful sights to see, with some different, but tasty traditional meals. Unfortunately during our time there, it was quite rainy and cloudy and cold, but that didn’t stop our ventures and fun experiences in the city, including a river cruise with a lunch buffet! It was the first cruise with meal experience I’ve ever had, so it was quite enjoyable, sitting comfortably in the warmth of the boat while also seeing the city and eating delicious foods from the buffet (which I’d say we definitely got our money’s worth 😋). We also were determined to try a famous trending traditional dessert in Prague, one which I forgot the name of but will insert a picture of it below! It’s a delicious cone made of sugary bread filled with strawberries and melted chocolate (and sometimes ice cream), and it was quite enjoyable and definitely recommended for dessert lovers!
Now, onto the unfortunate circumstance…
It was our last day in Prague when we decided to try a famous café that ChatGPT recommended us to try. For the time we had spent in Prague, we used walking as our main form of transportation, as many things conveniently were located near each other. But, because it was our last day and we had been tired of walking around for many days prior, we decided to try out the public transit to rest our legs but also test out how to use their transportation system, as we needed to use the metro the following day to arrive at the airport from the city center. So, we walked to the tram stop that would take us to the café, where we looked for a ticket booth to buy a tram ticket, but there were none to be found. So, we assumed we would need to simply purchase a ticket on-board the tram, as some public transit systems have a tap-to-pay machine installed in the trams/buses. So, when the tram had arrived, we got on and saw a machine where the ticket could be bought. The tram was full of people, to the point that shoulders were touching for anyone nearby each other, and the only machine to buy the ticket was down near the exit door of the tram. So, we had planned to walk towards the back of the tram to the ticket machine, but the tram took off and we had lost balance for a bit, so we resettled and balanced ourselves, and shortly after this, a man in casual dark clothes approached us. He said “ticket check”, “I need to see your tickets”. We told the man, wearing no uniform but holding a ring badge to show his identity as a ticket inspector, that we had just got on the train and we needed to make our way down the train to purchase our tickets. He had quite a heavy accent and we were not completely sure if he understood what we had been telling him, but he kept repeating the question of needing to see our tickets, in which we kept responding that we had just arrived on the tram to buy them. He quickly became defensive and said that we are not allowed to ride the trams for free, stating in Czechia, people are not allowed to use public transit for free. He then asked us for our passports, implying that he knew we were not from the country, which attributes to my suspected belief that we were targeted for this “scheme” because we were quite obviously tourists. So, after he had taken our passports and “inspected” them, he told us that we had to follow him and leave the tram. He was holding onto all three of our passports at this point and was making his way towards the exit of the tram. So, I asked if we could get our passports back at least and he insisted that later he would give them back but we needed to follow him to exit the tram. From the time this man approached us and began assertively accusing us of trying to ride the tram for free, my suspicions of this man being a scammer was at the forefront of my mind. At that moment when he had taken our passports and was walking towards the exit of the tram, I was quite nervous and rushed to thinking that at any moment, this man could run and steal our passports (a fear of mine especially because this happened to my mom’s friend the last time she was in Prague). So, at that moment, I was a bit on edge about what could be the end result of this interaction with a man who claimed to be a ticket inspector. Luckily though, I kept my trails right behind him to ensure if anything were to happen, he wouldn’t be too far from me. We eventually all got off the tram and the man had told us yet again, that we were not allowed to ride the tram for free. We further continued to defend ourselves and describe our situation, as he truly had approached us after about a minute of stepping onto the tram. When we were talking to him about our situation, another man walked over in a similar non-uniform look, with the same ring badge, where he was consulted on what to do in this situation. This man, who was supposedly another ticket inspector, told us the same thing, that we weren’t allowed to be on the tram for free and because we didn’t pay for a ticket, we would be fined. This same man further asked what passports we held, and he saw an Italian and American passport, in which he made a quite abrasive and quite honestly offensive remark to the fact that we were Americans, which is yet another reason why I felt we were targeted. Ultimately though, these two men were saying that we had to pay the fine, and there was no way to get ourselves out of it, no matter how many times we had explained the circumstances we were in. They showed no leniency whatsoever and were constantly assertive in the fact that, because we hadn’t purchased a less than 2 Euro tram ticket at the time he had approached us, that we would be fined nearly 45 Euros each. He had further threatened that if we didn’t want to pay him now, ministry transport officers would be called and we would have to go to the ministry office of transport, and pay an even higher fine of almost 70 Euros. At this time, I had still had the idea that we could be confronted by scammers, so before agreeing to anything, I Googled the public transit fine laws in Prague to ensure that what he was saying, was valid. After looking at the ministry’s website and some articles, the man’s words had aligned with what the written laws stated, but, in my eyes, it still didn’t necessarily legitimize him as an authentic ticket inspector. The Google search I made also warned that some scammers may be at play, impersonating to be authentic ticket inspectors, so it warned that their badges should be inspected to authenticate their legitimacy. So, I had asked to see their badge, which I had already seen when the man first approached us, as he showed us his badge ring. I looked at the badge, but felt quite unknowledgeable, as I didn’t know how to tell if the badge was legitimate or not, so there wasn’t much I could do at that point. After this attempt, for a moment, we had collectively considered letting them call the ministry transit officers to come and prove their authenticity as ticket inspectors. But, they warned us, as the law stated, if we called the ministry transit officers, we would have to pay a higher fine than if we just agreed to pay these ticket inspectors there on the spot, which is one aspect of the city’s transit laws that I personally believe is truthfully, incredibly illogical and unfair. Ultimately, after being quite spooked and frazzled from the situation we found ourselves in, we decided to just pay the men the nearly 45 Euros they had asked for. After paying and leaving these men, we walked a couple steps away from the stop we were forced to be at, and had debriefed on what just happened. We were all quite emotional, feeling angry, scared, sad, nervous, and a bit skeptical about what had just happened. So, we did what any young lady would do in a frazzling situation such as this one, and all got on the phone with our mothers and described with all our emotions, the situation that just occurred. Ultimately though, our valuable Mothers’ advices were to not let this situation impact the rest of our day and time in Prague, and that at least we were safe and nothing terrible like our passports being stolen, happened. This was true, but for the rest of the day, our moods were all collectively quite down and we had felt quite irritated at the situation that had happened. In fact, we had been so scarred and angered from the situation, that the next day, we just booked an Uber to take us to the airport, and luckily this easier, stress-less, and more secure option wasn’t too much more expensive.
So, to come to a close on our experience and perceptions on Prague, our time there was truly quite nice and enjoyable up until the moment that we had arguably been targeted by the supposed ministry ticket inspectors of the city. So, as of now, I have mixed emotions and thoughts on Prague, and am not completely sure if it’s a city I feel I could return to again, which is quite unfortunate.
Ultimately though, to end the blog on a brighter note, after our upsetting last experience in Prague, we had a new journey to look forward to. On March 15th, we took the flight back “home” to London Gatwick, where we spent a couple hours in the airport eating and resting to gain energy for our next flight to Dublin, which was on the same day, and the next journey to be discussed!
So, reflecting on the past two-weeks spent abroad, there were many fun, new, and exciting experiences and memories, but it was also naturally a bit tiring, but as mentioned, the traveling did not stop there… who needs rest?!
So, until the next post and journey,
See you then!
From,
Kyla

Skeletons appear to crawl out of front yards. Some wave at me, and others seem to be enjoying themselves on porch swings as though they’re still dressed in muscle, organs, and skin and are filled with oxygen and life. Pumpkins line steps, some already carved, their faces misshapen and sagging from the heat in this part of the country, smiles now frowns melting onto the pavement.
Haunted houses are available throughout the city, replicating horrors we can also view on television and movie screens. These experiences provide people with the psychological opportunity to feel the relief of being able to survive or walk away from something that is not actually dangerous.
Sometimes, we walk through cities on “ghost tours” to hear stories about hauntings, what happened long ago to spur these legends, and to decide whether any spirits are restless. Maybe we go because we want to learn; perhaps we want to understand. Maybe we want to know the unknowable between life and death.
Executions of every variety were town spectator shows hundreds of years ago in Prague, and the heads of decapitated noblemen were suspended from the towers at both ends of the Charles Bridge. Macabre scenes like this…

After — back in May 2000 — I secured my monthly Metro pass, moved into my crash-pad, and got all of the visa, residence, and working permit paperwork half-way done, the real problem started: Where to get a coffee that actually deserves its name? Plus, what café or coffeehouse in good old Praha 1 (roughly) can you sit in comfortably and read, write, watch people, and/or chat? Back then, Prague didn’t have much that compared favorably to the coffeehouses in Vienna[1], or even some Starbucks outlet.
Things have seriously changed since then. It started around 2002 with a series of CoffeeHeaven outlets, a Polish coffee and sandwich chain that modeled itself after Starbucks but which had to sell years back all its outlets to London-based Costa Coffee. These days it seems that Costa Coffee has at least one shop on every downtown block. I still have my CoffeeHeaven bonus card, and Costa Coffee honor it, and I feel very smug every time I use it.
Around 2007–8, Starbucks finally invaded Prague with a couple of strategically located outlets and has since added a number of outlets, mostly in downtown. Google Starbucks in Prague. You can have your first SBUX fix at the airport. There are outlets for example at Václavské nám. 40 (corner Štěpánská), Jungmannova 34, Spálená 74/18 (near metro station Národní třída), and a couple of them near Old Town Square and so on. Can’t really miss them. The offerings are standard, as is the coffee and the food-stuff they offer. I have come to appreciate them because many of them are spacious (e.g., second level at Václavské nám. or the yuuuge Jungmannova outlet), they have free and reasonably good wifi (and no one cares whether you sit there for hours and hammer away), and the staff tends to be friendly and know what they are doing. Unfortunately that is often not true for many of the Costa Coffee places which can be claustrophobic, are run by staff that occasionally seems in over its head, and just seem less well-trained and efficient than their SBUX counterparts. That said, the Costa Coffee outlet in the Václavské nám. (“Rokoko”) pasáž remains one of my fav meeting places, increasingly though due to its centrality and short walking distance from my Praha workplace rather than the foodstuff or coffee they offer.
There are, of course, scores of nice stand-alone places (or minor chains such as mamacoffee, about which more in a sec) where you can have a good kava and read, write, chat comfortably, and/or dream. In short, places that fulfil the Rubinstein criterion, i.e., a place “where you can … think!” (I note parenthetically that for Ariel — who drinks strongly watered down instant coffee — it is all about the ambiance, while for me it is about both the environs and the quality of the coffee!)
In the neighborhood where I live (Prague 10, Vršovice), there were — before the pandemic — about a dozen cafes (no less than three within 20 meters of the Ruská tram stop) of which many were quite nice. Unfortunately, half of them have shut down. If you happen to be in my hood, do try this one which happens to pass the Rubinstein test with flying colors. As does this one, just a hundred meters down the road.
But this write-up is about cafes and coffee houses in Praha 1. So there. Talking about places that don’t exist any longer but that nurtured my coffee addiction while living in Prague: a shout-out to now defunct Ebel Coffee House, Kawa Kawa Kawa, and the Tonkin café!
Prague’s is still not quite comparable to the coffee culture that exists in Sydney or Melbourne but getting a good coffee in Prague is no longer the very real problem it was back in May 2000. Tripadvisor, under Restaurants in Prague, subsection Coffee & Tea, currently lists 367 places.
Below are the results of my recent, and very diligent, research in matters kava in Prague 1 (downtown). Suggestions for places I missed, or even dissenting opinions, are always welcome. Send to aortmann@gmail.com, or comment below if you like.
I take responsibility for all errors in judgement.
My current favorites follow presently (places I don’t much like have their own section at the end); note that none of my thirteen recommendations has made it to the top ten in the Tripadvisor ranking of best 10 cafés in Praha 1 (City Center). I am sure that those in the Tripadvisor top ten fail the Rubinstein test (Coffee Places where you can … think!)
Divadelini kavarna, attached to STUDIO DVA DIVADLO, Wenceslas Square 56, nestled away in a pasaz (Fenix palace/Palac Fenix)
Located in a pasaz off Vaclavske namesti but hidden enough to normally not being discovered by tourists, this has been one of my favorites for years.
You can sit inside and outside (in the pasaz that is), they offer coffee and wine and some fine food stuff such as omelettes, pancakes, hommos and avocado sandwiches, cheesecake with raspberry sauce, chocolate curd cake, etc.
A great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee, or a glass of wine for that matter. Note the pictures on the wall — portraits of less or more famous Czech actors. Don’t be surprised if you see one of these folks at the table next to you. That’s because this is the place where the actors go, after the show and before, and before and after practices at the attached divadlo, too.
The restaurant/kavarna is open from 9:00 am to 23:00 on weekdays and at 11:00 on weekends or holidays; breakfast is served until 11 only. So no omelettes on the weekend. Shucks because their omelettes are to die for.
They do have free wifi.
I can’t find them on Tripadvisor or Facebook.
Warning: There’s a bunch of divadelini kavarnas out there, so make sure you go to right one.
Monkey Coffee House Opletalova 922/8 Praha 1 (and also Pod Harfou 995/23)
A somewhat Spartan coffee house although they also have wine on offer. They (and I’m talking about the Opletalova site which opened early in 2023) have some sweet stuff (brownies, banana bread, impressive croissants) but various kinds of excellent coffees (including hand brews) and it’s a great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee.
The Opletalova site opens at 8 am and closes at 6 pm, all week including weekends (as of now) when they currently start at 10 am.
They do have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook although most of the pictures there are for the Pod Harfou site for now. They are on Instagram, too. My Tripadvisor review is here.
Bonus: Across the street from them is a place that offers a well-stocked assortment of Italian food imports, from coffee capsules, to chocolate, to grappa, and vino. Also, a few meters to the right there’s a cafe with lots of fabulous cakes etc. and next to that is a bakery with incredibly good bread.
Cafe Academia Vaclavske Namesti 792/34
This is in the middle of the city and Tourist Central. But you won’t know because the cafe is clearly frequented mostly by locals, last but not least (older) ladies reading in the books from the bookstore. ;-)
The cafe is nestled away on the second floor, in the back, of the Academia bookstore (which in fact is where you find the academic books). The coffee is surprisingly good. (Not quite of Monkey Coffee House quality but then what is ?!) They also have some sweet and tempting stuff (and even a cheese or ham&cheese toast, with salad) and a few house wines, in case you want to ease into winetime. ;-)
The bookstore of which the cafe is a part of is large and one of the better ones in Prague. (They have a sizable section of English language books downstairs.)
While the cafe is quite nice — real flowers and comfy chairs and all, with service that has some upside potential— , there is also balcony overlooking Václavské náměstí on the other side of the second floor. Great view!
They are open from 9–19:30 on weekdays and 10–18:30/17:30 on weekends.
They do not have free wifi but my eduroam connected automatically and just fine. (There is also free wifi in much of downtown Prague, so you should be able to log in from pretty much everywhere.)
You can find the Academia cafe on Tripadvisor and Facebook. They are on Instagram, too.
Spell Jindřišská 939/20, nestled away in a yard, entrance next to the (awful) Green Tomato restaurant, and attached to a hair studio
You can sit inside and outside, they offer coffee (not bad, but not of Monkey Coffee House quality) and some sweet stuff including a bowl with tvarok and fruit that is excellent. They have wine, too.
Another great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee, or a glass of wine or two.
They are open from 7:00 am to 20:00 on weekdays and open at 8:00 and 10:00 on weekends when they close earlier (14:00 and 18:00 it seems).
They do have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook and also Instagram.
The Barrister café and winebar (Kavárna | Vinárna) Štěpánská 629/59 (across the street from the Alcron Hotel, a few metres down the street, literally a stone’s throw away from Wenceslas Square)
A wide and stylish space, where you can sit and read and write. And have conversations. And where you can segue from coffee time to wine time without having to change the location. What’s not to like?
The coffee is good, as are the wine offerings. They do have some sweets, and a couple of other food offerings. Their menu is here. For downtown Prague the prices are reasonable.
The service is friendly and professional, mostly.
Open every weekday 8:00 to 22:00 and during the vikend from 9:00 to 22:00 and 13:00, respectively.
They have free wifi.
You can find them on Instagram here and on Facebook here (mostly in Czech though). The do have a (claimed) Tripadvisor page but there are no reviews yet as of 26 June 2025. Give it a try!
Sicily café Senovážné nám. 994/2 Praha 1
It is both a kavarna and restaurant. You can find their offerings here (in Czech and English); lots of nice stuff (lots of veg(etari)an options).
It’s a good place to work, shoot the breeze, or have conversations although it does get quite crowded around lunch time, so if you like to work there, it is best to go there in off-peak hours.
They open at 8:30 on weekdays and 9:30 on the weekend and close at 22:00 (except Sunday when they close at 21:00).
Breakfast weekdays until 12:00 and weekends all day.
They have free wifi although “sometimes it don’t work” as a waitress (who clearly could not care less) informed me on a recent outing.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook. My 2016 Tripadvisor review is here.
Mama café Vodičkova 10 Praha 1 (about 5 minutes leisurely walk from Václavské náměstí, follow the tram tracks)
It’s part of a chain that has other branches in Prahe 2, 3, 4, and Praha 7. There is apparently another related café in Praha 1 (Café NEZISK at Pohořelec 2). A trust-worthy informant tells me that the Vinohrady (also Praha 2) site is even better than the Vodičkova site.
The Vodičkova site is both a kavarna and restaurant that has daily menus of brekkie (scrambled eggs, curd pancakes, granola), various hummus related dishes (e.g., hummus with pita, hummus bowl, mezze plate), and sandwiches (e.g with egg spread or green pea spread); lots of veg(etari)an options. You can substitute the pita with veggie sticks if you so desire. Plus plenty of sweet stuff (cakes!) of tempting quality. You can find their offerings here (in Czech and English and several other languages). The food is really quite good and relatively inexpensive. Say, simple scrambled eggs are 165 koruns and come with a lovely serving of coleslaw, or some other salad du jour. The espresso is on the bitter side for my taste; the latte, even if strong, is on the weak side.
It’s a great place to work though, shoot the breeze, or have conversations although it does get quite crowded quickly (e.g., on a recent Saturday morning at 10 a.m. all seats were occupied), so if you like to work there, it is best to go there in off-peak hours.
They open at 8:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on the weekend and close at 22:00 (except weekends when they close at 20:00). Service tends to be exceptionally nice.
They do have free wifi (and it works best on the upper floor which is also much more spacious than the ground floor.)
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook.
Prague Bakeshop Kozi 1
This place existed when I moved to Prague in 2000. It was under different ownership then and has been a bit modernized but it is basically the same configuration and many of the same goodies and the same coffee cups etc.
It’s not a place where you could work; too crowded especially during peak hours. (Beware of pocket thiefs then in particular.) The saving grace are the wooden benches outside. In fact, that’s where you find me many Saturday and Sunday mornings. That’s because it’s the best place in downtown Prague to get a good coffee at 7 a.m. every day of the week. (Yes, that includes Saturdays and Sundays.) Plus, the area in which the Prague Bakeshop is located (very very close to Old Town Square), is absolutely peaceful and gorgeous that early in the morning. (Well, mostly, if you can ignore the drunkards, and shady characters, that spill out of the bars across the street. Most of them are fun to watch.)
A great way to start the day. In fact, I can’t think of a much better way to start it. Try their croissants, dorty (cakes), kolaces (tarts, tortes, pies), sandwiches, or quiches. Or their coffee (which for my taste is on the weak side but drinkable).
Open every day 7–21.
They now have (free) wifi. Took them a long time to get there! (Pro-tip: It sometimes does not work but outside you can log into the free wifi of the James Dean club across the street.)
You can study their menu here, in both Czech and English.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook. My 2018 Tripadvisor review is here.
Head Shot Coffee Palackého 720/5, located in the Franciscan Gardens, in the corner furthest away from the entrances
A fairly small space with a lovely outside, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It’s not the kind of place that a tourist would easily find; it seems indeed frequented by locals mostly.
HSC offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of deliciously looking cakes etc. A few sandwiches and hummus, too.
Open every week day from 8:00 to 19:30. Saturdays and Sunday they are currently open from 10:00 to 18:00.
They have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor, and Facebook and Instagram.
Café Truhlárna Františkánská zahrada, Jungmannovo nám. 751/19 (when you enter the Gardens from Jungmanova namesti, 50 meters to the left)
A fairly small space with a lovely outside, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It’s not the kind of place that a tourist would easily find but they do occasionally, although the Truhlarna folks advertise themselves and their wares on a blackboard outside in Czech only; it seems frequented by locals mostly.
The cafe offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of deliciously looking cakes etc. A few sandwiches, too. Very friendly staff.
Open every day except Sunday from 8:30 to 20:00 except for Saturday and Sunday when they start at 10:00.
They have free wifi and their network is called zahrahda; password is posted at the counter.
You can find them on Tripadvisor, and Facebook and Instagram.
Goodlok café Jungmannovo namEsti 18 (next to the entrance to Francescan Gardens, near the SBUX on Jungmannovo namEsti)
A wide open space, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. Although I suspect, it being in Tourist Central neighborhood, the staff would not look at you too kindly if you sit there for hours at a time. Or for that matter, potential visitors.
Goodlok offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of fruit juices and kombuchas. They also have omelettes (very good indeed, I had), kimchi-toasts, and other offerings. Food is served until 15:00 Personnel is friendly.
Open every weekday 8:00 to 18:00; not open on weekends it seems.
They have free wifi.
You can study their menu here, in Czech.
You can find them on Tripadvisor (two sites! here and here, few reviews but raves all the same), and Instagram.
Kavarna Adria formally, Národní 40, but adjacent to Jungmannovo namEsti (on the second floor of the massive Palác Adria building)
This is an amazing space (including a very large terrasse), where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It is still to some extent Tourist Central neighborhood (last but not least since the place is written up in many a tourist guide), alas … my experiences have been mostly good. But then I rarely get anything complicated. Mostly caffe lattes (strong) or double espressos, occasionally the cheese omelette, very occasionally a poppy seed cake, etc. I should mention that the dozen or so cakes Adria has on offer are superb and if you are sweet-tooth, you definitely want to try a couple at least.
Service runs the gamut and I am not surprised to see service on Tripadvisor rated a dismal 3.5. With some reporting pretty bad experiences.
Open weekdays 8:00 to 23:00, and weekends from 9:00 to 22:00.
They have free wifi.
You can study their (lunch) menu here, in Czech and English.
Coffee Cube Black Jungmannovo nám. 6/767 (Thanks, Michael!)
Fantova kavarna Wilsonova 300/8
Tynska Literarni Kavarna Tynska 630/6
Kavarna Kampus Hybernská Hybernská 4 (Thanks, Sebastian!)
Super Tramp Coffee Opatovická 160 (Thanks, Elisaveta!)
Liliová (Choco Café) Liliová 250/4 (Thanks, Adela!)
So these are my favorite places right now, most of them not well-known but I am confident you will not be disappointed. There are many more well-known cafes and coffeehouses in Prague such as Café Louvre (not bad actually but failing the Rubinstein test), Café Slavia, Café Savoy (all on the tram 22 line, within a kilometer), Cerna Madona/Grand Café Orient, BISTRO, Café Boulevard (currently an astonishing 1.5 on Tripadvisor! Avoid!), etc.
[1] As Lenka Reinerova — may she rest in peace — put it, “Where, so I ask myself often when I wander through my Prague, have all the coffeehouses gone; those coffeehouses where, over a cup of good black coffee, you could spend much of the day discussing, making plans, hearing the latest gossip, watching — or getting to know — interesting people, making friends, or even falling in love.” (Das Traumcafé einer Pragerin [my café in the sky, 1996; my translation.)

“The streets of Prague were a fantasia scarcely touched by the twenty-first century — or the twentieth or nineteenth, for that matter. It was a city of alchemists and dreamers, its medieval cobbles once trod by golems, mystics, invading armies.” — Laini Taylor
The first sttlement of what is now Prague has been traced to the second half of the 9th century. The oldest building was Vyšehrad (“castle”), set on a commanding right bank hill. It was followed by what was to become Hradčany, set on an equally commanding left bank site a little downstream.
The name Prague, also known as Praha in Czech, is believed to originate from an old Slavic word, práh, which means “threshold” or “ford”. This refers to Prague’s location at a crossing point of the Vltava River and possibly to the city’s low-lying areas as a “threshold” to the Prague Castle. Another theory suggests the name comes from the verb “pražit” meaning “to roast” or “to burn,” possibly referring to the practice of removing forest cover by fire.
I think there’s a few cities in the world that have a genuine amount of magic in them, and Prague is definitely one of them. Once known as the nucleus of the Bohemian state Prague exudes it’s rich and complex history through every brick and spire.. I’ll give you an overview of how we spent our two days in this magical city and hopefully it can help with your own trip planning to this incredible destination.
After arriving in the Czech airport it’s very simple to take public transport in the form of a bus to Old Town Square which is like Disney World for history lovers.
The square’s center is home to a statue of religious reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in Konstanz for his beliefs. There are also memorials to the “martyrs” (including Jan Jesenius and Maxmillian Hostalek) who were beheaded on that spot during the Old Town Square execution by Hasburgs after the Battle of White Mountain. Ironically, greater than 70% of the Czech Republic identifies as religiously unaffiliatd with atheism being the most prominent non-religious affiliation.
Since this was the last leg of our honeymoon my husband splurged on the suite looking over the Old Town Square and a direct view of the incredible Astronomical Clock.
Straight out of the Golden Compass the Astronomical Clock (or Prague Orloj) is an icon of the Czech Republic. The clock mechanic, has 3 main cmponents: (1) the astronomical dial, representing the position of the sun and moon; (2) statues of various Catholic saints standing on either side of the clock; (3) “The Walk of the Apostles,” an hourly show of moving apostle figures and other sculptures, notably a figure of a skeleton that represents Death, striking the time, and a calender dial with medallions representing the months.
According to legend, the city will suffer if the clock is neglected and its operation placed in jeopardy.
Prague is known as the “City of a Hundred Spires” (or sometimes “City of 500 Spires”) because of the numerous turrets, towers, and spires that dot the city’s skyline. These spires, found on churches, castles, townhouses, and other historical structures, are a defining feature of Prague’s architectural landscape. The name was popularized by a 19th-century mathematician who counted the spires, and while the exact number has varied over time, the city’s skyline remains iconic for its spires.
We spent our first day just soaking in the amazing sites and history of the city. The city is very walkable and at every turn you can see architecture from a plethora of centuries all coming together to make a uniquely distinct Prague.
You can’t miss the Powder Tower, which is a dramatic 65 meter tall gothic tower built as one of the 13 gates to the city. This monumental entrance was taken by the Czech kings entering into Old Town during their coronation processions. It’s name comes from its former rol as a gunpowder store. A viewing gallery is located at a height of 44 meters providing a dazzling view of Prague.
No trip to Prague is complete without a walk (or 3…or 5) across the Charles Bridge. This bridge is guardd by thirty statues and sculptures of saints representing the great personalities of European and global history, each f whom somehow moved the world and changed it for the better. The spirituality of the saints gives Charles Bridge a mystical aura, a sort of open-air temple enclosed by the bridge towers. The bridge is particularly spectacular at night when the light of the gas lamps sculpts the architectural stone.
To make a wish, you can rub the figure of Jan Nepomuk which has been worn to a fine polish from centuries of previous wishes. For your second wish you will need to head towards the middle of the bridge. Yes you heard that right — this is a BOGO wish bridge situation. On the parapet of the bridge is a bronze statue of a saint with 5 stars around his head. To make a wish, put the finger of your right hand on the 5 stars. In this case, the left hand should be on the legs of Nepomuk. Then you need to step on the gold nail with your right foot. All three of these conditions must be completed for the second wish to come true.
Additionally around the city you can find a plethora of unique shops and markets. I particularly loved all the jewelery and glass stores. Prague, and by extension the Czech Republic, is famous for its glass, particularly Bohemian glass and crystal, due to a long tradition of craftsmanship, high quality, and unique designs.
One of my favorite things about Prague was the people. The hospitality in Italy and so much of Europe is gracious and a little over the top, but being in Prague I felt there was a certain down to earth and straightforward nature that was succinct but polite all at the same time. Being Ukrainian, I felt straight at home.
The food in Prague was absolutely incredible. One of our favorite restaurants was called Mincovna which was the former location of the Prague Mint. Every dish we tried there was incredible but I particularly loved the rabit and dumplings.
Of course, no discussion about Prague would be thorough without commenting on its rich beer culture. Pilsner Urquell is located adjacent to Prague and Straropramen, a major brewery, is a popular tourist destination with a visitor center and tours. The brewery’s history dates back to 1869, and it offers a diverse range of beers, including their flagship Staropramen brand. Prague also has smaller, independent breweries and brewpubs, some of which are listed in other search results.
I’m not a big beer fan but I really enjoyed the beer in Prague. In the Czech Republic, you’ll often encounter beers poured with a significant head of foam, which is considered an important part of the beer’s experience. This style, sometimes referred to as “mlíko,” is intentionally designed to have a thick, creamy head. This foam serves to keep the beer cold, fresh, and even adds a layer of sweetness that balances the beer’s bitterness
I highly recommend getting a good tour of the city since trying all of Pragues tasty treats is easiest with a well equipped guide (and who doesn’t like good company?).
Our food tour guide took us to see a plethora of Prague food classics included open faced sandwiches, which was a personal favorite as a I grew up eating them in my Ukranian family.
My personal favorites on the tour were the enormous (and I mean ENORMOUS) pork hok and pork schnitzel.
Our food tour guide not only covered the food of the city but also it’s history and culture. One particular story I enjoyed was of a Czech christmas food tradition, particularly in Prague, involving a carp. According to her it’s tradition to buy a live carp, bring them home, and keep them in the bathtub until Christmas Eve, sometimes naming them and treating them like pets. The carp is then cooked, often fried and served with potato salad, and is a key part of the Christmas Eve meal.
In my opinion the best evening sweet treat in Prague is the Trdelník. This is a kind of spit cake and variant of Kürtőskalács. It is made from dough that is wrapped around a stick, then baked and topped with sugar and walnut mix and filled with ice cream. Aka — pure ice cream heaven.
In Part 2 of this 2 day trip I’ll cover our second day in Prague which consisted of a bike tour, trip to the modern art museum, and the most incredible library tour. Hope this helped in your own travel plans!

History is impossible to remove from the minds of inhabitants, especially an entire nation’s past. It reminds them of everything they, or those before them, fought for and eventually lost. The hardship and torment can be seen in the very architecture, and if walls could talk, they’d surely cry out. Regular buildings no longer hold their innocence as every physical object takes on a new negative connotation.
Countries like Germany have dealt with this positively, owning up to the war crimes their ancestors committed. The Czech Republic, however, has not.
The capital city of Prague is a metropolis that, despite its newfound cultural optimism, has been beaten down by tyranny and existed under the boot of powers much larger than their own.
Yet, there is a previously unknown demographic of travelers that would be ecstatic to uncover the darker sides of the nation’s history. These individuals travel the world, specifically visiting the strangest and most infamous tourist attractions offered ‒ and sometimes restricted ‒ on the map. Visiting historical sites closely connected to death or tragedy is known as “Dark Tourism.”
Dark tourists get engrossed in the past in the oddest ways possible, whether on a stroll through the highly irradiated city of Chernobyl or a drive past the assassination spot of President John F. Kennedy. When death and tragedy strike, you can be sure, a dark tourist will be there a few hundred years later, Geiger Counter and a digital camera in-hand.
Despite being highly criticized as yet another way to desecrate or exploit a historical area and the dead associated with it, the popularity of Dark Tourism has risen in the last decade.
With the popularization of shows like the Netflix Original “Dark Tourist,” hosted by a New Zealander journalist, David Farrier, a whole new generation of dark tourists have emerged. Those who have seen Farrier’s excursions have witnessed an exponential amount of dark, thrilling, and outright controversial historical sites and experiences.
This is not your family’s average summer trip up to Mount Rushmore. In the show, Farrier meets Pablo Escobar’s charismatic enforcer, Popeye, in Columbia, and is guided through Escobar’s former apartment by the drug lord’s sister-in-law. David then witnesses an exorcism in Mexico and participates in a faux illegal border crossing. That’s just the first episode. Viewers see the danger and the controversy as appealing elements to this strange take on the typical family vacation.
The popularity of dark tourism has brought light to areas otherwise forgotten by society. Along with the extension of tourism, there is a necessity to address these events as something that has indeed happened and impossible to be neglected further. Cue the Czech Republic.
Under the site of what was once a 14,200-ton statue of the international icon of tyranny, Joseph Stalin, lives Prague’s newest and most innovative dark tourism hotspot. Organized by “Post Bellum,” an organization preserving Czech historical memory, this new exhibit opened to touch all recent modern cases of threatened life in the Czech Republic.
The exhibit offers a truly immersive look into Czech oppression of the 20th century. A dark, narrow-gated hallway with the only intruding sunlight from the doorway behind, leads visitors’ way to the viewing room. As the gate stops further down, ominous spotlights greet you.
From there you are thrown straight into a memorable experience filled with artificial gunfire, neon lighting, and even a secret police interrogation similar to those done to political prisoners in the early 1950s. A projector lights up the floor with planes bombing the terrain. The room paints a grim moving picture of Czech Jews being herded into concentration camps, like unsuspecting cattle to the slaughter.
You are then transported into the crypt of St. Cyril and St. Methodius Cathedral, where the paratroopers sent to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, high-ranking German Nazi official, are killed by overwhelming German forces. The room begins flooding and gunfire ricochets off the cement walls. Though only a simulation, the threat of danger seems real.
Dark tourists will immediately be intrigued by the immersive experience of reliving central Europe’s most gruesome moments. However, the purpose of this exhibit is not to purely glorify violence.
The experience is meaningfully disorientating, revealing a fraction of what the country has had to go through to shape itself into how we know it today. It is no coincidence that this exhibit correlates with the 100th anniversary of Czechoslovakia’s establishment, as it was designed to illustrate the long process of cultural identity.
There is a separate portion of the exhibit with an enclosed screening room where you can hear actual testimonials by those who lived in the eras of outright oppression. Jewish concentration camp survivors, former Communist party members, and victims of the vast oppression have all been recorded to give an oral first-person report of what transpired. This puts a face to the chaos and gives you an opportunity to sympathize.
Prague has limited museums covering this era, and none of them offer this intense look into almost a century of oppression and hardship. Presenting this narrative using particular lighting and audio arrangements convey the point well, simultaneously attracting dark tourists. That is what may just normalize the nation’s dark history: a darker form of tourism.

Prof. Jürgen Kocka spoke in Prague on Germany’s complex remembrance culture, addressing Nazi crimes, Germans as victims, expulsion, and the rise of populism. His reflections offer timely lessons for democracy.
On May 13, 2025, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic hosted one of the most distinguished German historians of our time, Prof. Jürgen Kocka. In a packed lecture hall at Národní 3, Prague, an audience of scholars, students, and interested citizens listened to his lecture: “Memory, Conflict and Research. Dealing with a Difficult Past.” This event was organized by the Collegium Carolinum, the German Historical Institute Warsaw, and the Leibniz Institute for History and Culture of Eastern Europe.
Prof. Kocka, born 1941 in Hejnice (Haindorf), northern Bohemia, expelled as a child, is uniquely positioned to reflect on the interwoven German and Central European histories. His academic journey led him to Bielefeld, Berlin, UCLA, and his research has shaped the international discourse on modern and social history.
The lecture offered a sweeping analysis of how Germany has dealt with its difficult 20th-century past, the Nazi dictatorship, its crimes, and the legacy of flight and expulsion in the aftermath of World War II. Kocka clearly distinguished between the Federal Republic and the GDR in their contrasting approaches to the Nazi past. While the West pursued a painful, slow, and self-critical confrontation, the East projected the Nazi past as a capitalist aberration, distancing its socialist present from any guilt.
“Commemoration becomes more abstract, less concrete, more institutionalized, more routinized”
Prof. Kocka observed, highlighting the challenges faced by younger generations in maintaining a vivid connection to the past. The second part of his lecture focused on Germans as victims -specifically, the millions who suffered flight and expulsion. Kocka underlined how difficult and politically charged this topic remained for decades, as many expellee organizations mixed legitimate memory with territorial claims. Only after 1990, with the definitive recognition of Germany’s eastern borders, could reconciliation with the neighbor countries and a more open remembrance culture develop.
Kocka gave special mention to the growing role of museums and local remembrance initiatives, such as the Isergebirgsmuseum in Bavaria, that now foster dialogue across former national divides.
However, his most thought-provoking section addressed recent shifts. In recent years, Germany has faced the rise of right-wing populism, symbolized by the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
“AfD speakers have demanded a 180-degree reversal of the course of our historical culture.”
Kocka warned, that AfD tries to play down the importance of the Nazi dictatorship and describe it as a minimal and excusable aberration, as a piece of foolishness.
At this point, I would like to add my personal comment. While I fully understand Prof. Kocka’s analytical caution, I believe the rise of the AfD also reflects deeper dissatisfaction in parts of society. In both East and West Germany, many people feel that the traditional parties have lost touch with the everyday concerns of their voters. The growing appeal of populists is not only about historical memory, but also about social frustration.
There is a Czech proverb that captures this dynamic very well:
“Kdo seje vítr, sklízí bouři”
“He who sows the wind shall reap the storm.”
Germany, a country that has had bitter experience with the consequences of political radicalization, should not forget that social alienation can undermine even the strongest democratic values.
This makes it all the more important for academic voices and civil society to remain vigilant, proactive, and open to dialogue across political and social divides. Only by understanding the roots of discontent can democratic institutions regain trust and legitimacy. In this sense, I am convinced that contributions like the one from Prof. Kocka are more important than ever.
As a researcher in the field of heritage language and collective memory, I see interesting parallels. Just as the third generation often loses the linguistic link to its ancestors , as my research on heritage language in the Riesengebirge shows , there seems to be a fading awareness of the historical foundations of Germany’s democratic consensus. This makes active remembrance work, both local and transnational, indispensable.
“Historians are better in describing and explaining the past than in predicting the future.”
Prof. Kocka concluded, offering a thoughtful reflection on the continuing challenges ahead. I would like to thank Prof. Kocka, the organizers, and the many participants who made this event in Prague a memorable intellectual exchange. It was a valuable contribution to a highly relevant, ongoing debate.

The mix of design, business and IT was very welcome. I learned most from talks outside my own area of expertise. That’s also what attracts me in interaction design: talking with clients and users, and learning new things from different subjects. I talked with everybody in the conference, from the speakers to the guy making the tea. The conference had a very open and relaxed atmosphere and there were several cool things besides the talks such as: 3d printing, Google Glass, and even a professional masseur. Another neat idea was the discomfort zone, where people were allowed to debate freely and play devils advocate without consequences. Also great were the after-conference parties and events. Sadly, the design workshop on Thursday didn’t happen due to lack of attendees.
The quality of the talks was very good overall. But it seemed that every design or business presentation has lists of “ideas”, “key takeaways”, “guidelines” or “insights’. A lot of them seemed trivial or made up on the spot (“listen to your users”, really?). It would have been better for most talks to stick to one message! Now, I’ll break that rule straight away and present some take-aways :)
Marli Mesbov gave a great presentation on the importance of story telling. Stories work better than short tag lines, which is probably related to Key Take Away 1 (no take-aways).
Stories work for conversion and for your clients to positively remember you. Do you remember the fairytale of the boy who cried wolf? Don’t you think that carries the message better than “don’t alarm us for nothing”? The average attention span went down from 12 seconds in 2000 to a mere 8 seconds in 2012, so better make your story captivating!
Besides working on your site, stories also work great for doing design. It’s an old saying, but still good advice: instead of designing for users, design for a story.
Lastly, a story can be used to instruct a client on how to use the website. Instead of delivering a 100 page styleguide which people don’t read, you can make a short story, a trailer or just a word (“dictionary”, “phonebook”), which ‘explains’ the site to the client.
It was great to hear some self-conscious critique on terms we use within the field. Our terms are confusing and their meaning differs per person and company: UX, service design and even interaction design (but less). Some people include visual design in there, programming, marketing… All very confusing! And what to think of terms like ‘expert’ or ‘guru’? Instead, it’s better to describe what you do and how it benefits the client or project.
Bad user experience costs money, which is what we tell our clients also But it was great to see some examples, such as Expedia losing 12 million dollar because of a form field or Best Buy losing 300 million dollar by requiring an unnecessary login. This holds especially for mobile use: a lot of apps are used only once or thrown away within a month. Avi Itzkovitch had some nice examples how to overcome such bad experience by making more use of context. For instance by adapting the interface based on location, time of day or usage pattern.
I wish it could be a wholehearted yes! I had a lot of fun, met great people and learned a lot, but… Some things nagged a bit, like the cancelled design workshop, the open doors in some design talks and the endless lists of recommendations. Another thing is the overlap in the program: breaks were different for each track making it difficult to switch. That might be why designers mostly went to the design track and programmers to the development tracks, making the mingling a lot less. On top of that, all speakers were “safe choices”, nobody went really overboard or crazy with some thought-provoking talk. Still, it was fun and I learned useful things, so, I guess it’s four out of five stars. For a visual impression, see the Facebook photostream
Webexpo puts the talks online (very slowly), so which ones should you see?

After a 5-hour train trip from Vienna, we arrived in Prague to find they don’t accept euro! I think if you want to be in the EU, one of the stipulations should be you must adopt the euro as your official currency. (enough of me on my soapbox!)
So still trying to work out the money conversions, we hired two taxis to take us to our hotel. They did quote us 800 Czech crowns for each car, but our brains were too tired to work out we were being ripped off! 32 euro was the approximate conversion for each cab!
We found out later, 260 Czech crowns was what each should have been! The next day, I found out that everyone gets ripped off by the taxi drivers in Prague, so I didn’t feel so bad. It’s just that they are the first taste you have of a new city, and we didn’t feel like spending another cent here!
So we decided to stay put in our lovely apartment and play Bananagrams. We started on the verandah but soon became chilled to the bone (even with drinking the red wine from the minibar) so moved inside. Our determination not to spend another cent was soon diminished by our hunger and Keeley and Kiryn headed out to find us some dinner — which they did, extremely successfully. Pizza and calzone — a new taste sensation! And VERY cheap!

I’ve been to Prague several times, for both professional and personal reasons. My last visit was just last week. Over the years, I’ve seen how overtourism has taken its toll on the city—especially with crowds of loud, drunken young tourists. But this time, for some reason, the streets were much quieter, with only a few visitors around. For the first time, I felt like I could truly see the city.

A few days before Christmas, I received the Winter Holidays Edition of the Prague for Expats Newsletter. It began by saying:
“we hope you are enjoying snowy Prague, as it really is the best time for long walks through the city and its surroundings”
I was a little taken aback by this, and my initial reaction was to question whether the author had ever visited Prague in the snow. Actually, TBH, that was my second reaction. My first wasn’t suitable for a family-oriented blog! Like many cities, Prague, in the snow, is far from being a good place for long walks. It’s not even a good place for short walks, especially in the city centre or “historic Prague” as it’s called in the guidebooks. For several days that week before Christmas, I felt more locked down than during the official lockdowns during the pandemic. During the pandemic, we were just discouraged from going out, but the snow is a different matter, and like many locals, I dread snowfall in the deep midwinter. The cold I can handle, which is good because it can get mighty chilly! But, not the snow…
Sure, from the comfort of a room with a view, Prague is absolutely stunning under a shroud of pristine white snow. The hills surrounding the city take on a bleakness in the pale grey light, but the scenery becomes stunning when the skies turn blue. Be forewarned. Once you step outside, walking around Prague becomes a nightmare. In her 2011 song, “50 Words for Snow”, Kate Bush got really close to the mark with “anklebreaker”.
The problem is Prague's pavements combined with the huge footfall of thousands of tourists. It takes very little time for the white snow to turn into an ashy dirty wet sludge which on Prague’s mosaic pavements becomes a skating rink even before the wet sludge starts to refreeze. When it’s cold enough (as it was last week), the sludge quickly turns into invisible sheets of ice which are treacherous to both body and ego. Let’s face it; no one likes to look like a clown when they’re walking down a street full of people; it’s embarrassing enough when you can’t be seen!
But the problems don’t just come from under your feet. You’re constantly at risk of an attack from above as snow begins to melt on the rooftops, there’s a threat of baby avalanches, icicles spearing you and huge dollops of icy meltwater, which almost always seem to land on your glasses (or bald patches).
Prague city authorities are quick to get the gritting wagons and carts out, but this compounds the problem. Even after ten days, some of the more heavily gritted pavements are still covered in pin-sharp little stones which get stuck in the soles of your shoes and need to be picked out with that penknife attachment you never use for getting stones out of horse's shoes!
I have yet to find a single pair of shoes that can deal with Prague pavements regardless of the weather. Some are great in the summer; some work well in the rain, but none work well in any snow conditions — not even proper mountain boots! I had a pair of ECCO Gore-tex shoes which were the best all-rounders, but sadly, these have been decimated by five years of constant usage walking around the city.
So, don’t be fooled by the tour guides, the glossy guidebooks and the slick videos showcasing our beautiful city under a fresh fall of snow. Call up an Uber to take you to Petrin Hill, up to Prague Castle, or over to Vitkov Hill, walk a few hundred yards, and marvel at the panoramas. Then get back in your taxi and get comfy in the hotel bar until the thaw has completed.
Unless, of course, you really want to put the Czech health system to the test or find out how good your insurance is!

The first light of dawn slips through the curtains of our hotel room. I glance over at my girlfriend, already awake, her eyes tracing the soft glow filtering in. Neither of us know why we’re up so early. It’s not jet lag or the faint hum of the city outside. So maybe, it’s the anticipation of wanting to see a side of Prague that most visitors miss.
We step outside into the cool morning air. The cobblestones feel damp beneath our feet. Street lamps cast soft halos in the mist, and somewhere in the distance, a bird begins to sing. The city feels quiet, almost like it’s waiting for something to happen.
We turn the corner together and spot the Old Town Hall. Its underground played a pivotal role in the Prague Uprising against Nazism. Attached to it is the Astronomical Clock, a medieval wonder that shows the positions of the Sun, Moon, Earth, and Zodiac constellations.
Humanity has tried to measure time for millennia. From the Maya in Mesoamerica to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in the UK…

Going to Prague? Get ready for your Czech vacation with these tips.
Some of these things are common around Europe; some are specific to Prague. I’ve lived in Prague for over a year. Since I’ve only lived in Prague, I’ll just say you should know these for the Czech Republic, and I won’t speak for elsewhere.
Prague is separated into sections by numbers, which will often be referred to in addresses or directions. If you’re a visitor, you’ll most likely spend your time around Prague 1 and Prague 2, which host quintessential Prague sightseeing.
Most buildings addresses in the Czech Republic have two numbers. For example, my former apartment’s building number was 535/2. The building in this picture would have the number 800/50. Both these numbers will appear on placards outside each building, though sometimes only one number will be listed on an address. Knowing this may make navigating a little less confusing.
Going back to the example of my old apartment, the full address was Kubova 535/2. The street name, Kubova, is listed before the numbers, as is the norm with Czech address conventions. In the US, a street may be something like 123 Smith St. In the Czech Republic, that would look something like Smith 123/1.
Public transport is the best and cheapest way to get around Prague. While Prague is a very walkable city, knowing how to navigate its public transport is crucial. Let’s make sure you know how to do it.
To legally use public transport in the Czech Republic, you need to both buy and validate your ticket near the start of your journey. Purchase will always happen before entry. Validation will happen before entry for metro, and on entry for buses and trams. If you don’t understand, don’t worry. Everything is explained below.
First thing to know: all public transport tickets are the same for Prague’s metros, buses, and trams. You don’t need to buy separate tickets for each.
To purchase tickets, look for a ticket machine. Most ticket machines will look like this:
This older style of machine accepts:
They also have a newer style that looks like this, or a variation of this, but are much rarer:
This newer style of machine accepts:
To buy a ticket, hit the button next to the ticket you want, put your payment method in, and the ticket will subsequently be printed for you.
These ticket machines can be found in all metro stations and the airport. Frustratingly, most bus stops and tram stops don’t have them. If you can’t find a machine near a stop, look for the nearest tobacco shop, as they always carry tickets.
Tickets are separated by lengths of time and zones. For a regular tourist, as long as you’re staying within the main parts of Prague (which is almost everyone), you don’t need to worry about zone. Only pick a ticket based on how long you plan to spend traveling that day.
The most common ticket lengths are:
You can also text to purchase a ticket if you have a valid Czech phone number through O2, T-mobile, or Vodafone (local Czech carriers). If you want to use this method but don’t have a Prague phone plan, you can pick up a SIM card at almost any Czech corner store or phone carrier store. Note: please don’t buy a phone ticket until you need it as these tickets can’t be saved for later — they don’t require validation and are active immediately after confirmation of purchase.
Once you’ve successfully purchased your ticket, you’ll also have to validate the ticket.
To understand the difference between purchase and validation, first you have to recognize that Czech tickets are time-based, meaning you can buy a ticket that lasts for a specific amount of time, say 90 minutes. The purchase of the ticket gives you the right to ride for 90 minutes, during any 90-minutes. Validation indicates the start/end time of that 90-minute window.
Validation machines look like this:
To validate, insert the ticket into the slot indicated by the arrow on the validator. Push the ticket in until you feel a punch on the ticket. The punch will display the starting time and date for the validity of your ticket. You are authorized to ride from the time that you purchase + the duration of the ticket you bought.
Validators are found in the metro station, near the area where you enter the station. You must validate your ticket upon entry to the station; you cannot validate a ticket after you’ve boarded a train. Validators for trams and buses, however, are found inside the vehicles themselves. You can only validate tram and bus tickets after entry.
If you purchased your ticket via phone, you do not need to validate it. The timing for the phone ticket starts when you receive confirmation for your purchase. Because of this, make sure not to buy a phone ticket before you need it!
You have the right to ride the transport for the duration your ticket indicates starting from the time you validate. If you’ve already validated your paper ticket and are going to ride another leg of public transport while it’s still valid, you do not need to validate again (how many times did I just said valid?). You can also switch public transport types during this time, which means you can walk off the metro and onto a tram. As long as your ticket is valid, you don’t have to do anything during this switch.
Remember: a Czech public transport ticket is not valid unless it’s validated!
Please note you must buy a separate ticket for a large piece of luggage. To do this on a coin machine, press the discount ticket button (a separate button on the machine) before pressing the time duration you want. On the newer machines, discounted tickets should be an option you navigate to on the touch menu. This discounted ticket legally lets you carry the luggage on public transport.
These discounted fares can also be used on tickets for seniors, between 65–70 years old, and children aged 6–15. Riders older than 70 and riders younger than 6 do not have to pay fare.
A detailed breakdown of fares and costs can be found here.
In my research for this article, I stumbled across a Prague multi-day tourist pass that pre-pays for public transport and attractions. I haven’t used it, so I can’t vouch for its value, but I wanted to throw it out there as an FYI. More info here.
Fare is enforced inconsistently and randomly. If you’re entering the metro station or if you’re actively riding the tram or bus, you may be approached by a fare enforcer. These are uniformed transport employees (though sometimes they dress like a normal person to go undercover) who ask to see your public transport ticket. They will show a badge to identify themselves in all cases.
If your fare is valid, they will let you go. If it’s not, you will be charged 800 crowns (~$40). Fare will rarely be checked, but the fine is hefty if you get caught without it.
If you are caught without fare, you will get a written notice and will immediately pay the entirety of the fine.
In the US, public transport doors will usually open automatically at every stop or at the discretion of an operator. This is not the case in Europe. Many times, riders have to physically press a button to open public transport doors. If a train, tram, or bus has come to a complete stop and the doors aren’t opening, look for a button on or near the door to let yourself on.
If you’re using escalators to get on/off public transport, or literally anywhere else in Prague, always always always stand on the right side and make sure you’re not blocking the left side. Right is for standing, left is for walking. People will be sour if you don’t follow this norm and block the path.
Totally! And it’s actually pretty cheap. I’ve used it more times than I like to admit. Regardless, you can definitely use Uber here, but you’ll look like a tourist. There’s also an Uber competitor called Taxify that’s worth checking out if you’re into ridesharing.
Czechs can’t stand the sound of sniffling. People will get annoyed with you for sniffling in public. Instead, Czechs almost always carry around travel-sized tissue packets and constantly blow their noses. This brings me to my next point…
Literally everywhere. Sitting right next to you on the train? They’ll blow their noses. In conversation? They’ll blow their noses. While eating? They’ll blow their noses. Americans consider this pretty gross. It took me a while to get used to the constant nose blowing and seeming obliviousness to American norms around this. Now that I’m used to it, it makes hanging out with people while you’re suffering with a cold a lot more manageable, albeit still unsightly.
This one’s a little bit of a stereotype, but Czechs love wearing socks and sandals. I will admit that anecdotally, I’ve seen way more sock + sandal combinations here than anywhere else, and I studied engineering. Luckily, looks like it’s fashionable now?
You’ll see these all over Prague. Czechs love putting them on their backpacks and baby strollers. They’re *everywhere*.
You’ll also see these all over Prague. I have no idea why.
Czechs have a habit of staring intensely into each other’s eyes while toasting over drinks. It’s very disconcerting.
Americans think Europeans’ habit of a kiss on each cheek in greeting is invasive. Europeans, in turn, think pressing bodies against each other (aka hugging) in greeting is weird. Get used to lightly kissing people if you want to move here.
When Czechs enter or exit elevators or waiting rooms, they say hello and goodbye, respectively. For example, if you get called into the doctor’s office after sitting in the waiting room, you’re supposed to say a soft goodbye to the room. When you get on an elevator, you say hello to the other riders. It’s a really weird thing from an American standpoint, but here I’m pretty sure I come off very cold because I usually forget to do this.
Czechs do not wear shoes in their homes. Nearly every home or apartment will have an entryway in the beginning where you’re expected to take your shoes off. If you want to keep them on in the home for any reason, make sure to ask the host for permission first.
The Czech Republic’s national language is, well, Czech. It’s part of the Slavic language family and is similar to other languages you’re probably not super familiar with, like Polish and Slovak. To get a sense of what Czech sounds like, here’s a video of Let It Go in Czech.
In Prague, absolutely not. I know people who live here that have decided not to learn Czech; it’s that easy to get around with English. You’ll also find a lot of people who speak Russian and German. The options are (figuratively) endless.
If you leave Prague and head out to the countryside, though, be prepared to have a lot more trouble with the language barrier.
Hello: dobry denYes: anoNo: neThank you: dekuji (pronounced dee-yeh-koo-yee)Please: prosim
The Czech word for “yes” is ano, which often gets shortened to no. So in the Czech Republic, if someone says no, they might really mean yes. Be prepared to be confused.
Fakt jo in Czech, pronounced facked yo, sounds a lot like, well… you get it. In Czech it’s a phrase for “really?” So don’t worry, you’re not hearing Czechs yell expletives at each other, just asking for clarification. If you want to know when they’re swearing at each other, the word you’re listening for is prdel (pronounced pruh-dell).
As a courtesy, a lot of places will have menus in English. Those English menus, however, are often riddled with mistranslations. I’ve seen dishes that were supposed to be vegetarian come out with meat on them because the translation was wrong (something about mixing up the word peppers with peppered sausage). Below is an image of my personal favorite.
In English, if you want to offer someone a drink, you say “Would you like some tea?” In the Czech language, the same phrase is structured as “Wouldn’t you like some tea?”
When Czechs speak English, it’s common for them to say “don’t you want” instead of “do you want,” because that’s how it’s said in their native tongue. Knowing this fosters understanding, because getting asked a question the Czech way sounds imposing and rude to Americans. For me, it took a sec to recover from my doctor asking me “Didn’t you gain some weight?”
Though not formally an English-speaking city, Prague has lots of signs in English. They do write things slightly differently than we would, so here’s some phrases you should know:
Czechs use a denomination called a crown. At the time of this writing, 1 US dollar = ~20 crowns.
When given a number in crowns, the easiest way to roughly convert in your head is to move the decimal point to the left by one place, then divide by 2.
So if your bill is 350 crowns, moving the decimal place to the left by one place gives you 35, divide by 2 gives you 17.5. So 350 crowns = ~$17.50.
In the US, dates are written as MM/DD/YYYY. In other parts of the world, it’s normal to write DD/MM/YYYY. So if you see 08/12/2018, that’s December 8th in Europe, not August 12th. You’ve been warned.
In the US, we use periods to separate whole numbers from fractions of numbers. $5.10 means “five dollars and one-tenth of a dollar.” In Europe, they’d write the same number as 5,10 crowns.
For a larger number, we’d write something like $1,000.34. In Prague, they’ll use spaces instead of commas and commas instead of periods. So the same number on your bill at a restaurant may look like 1 000,34 crowns (that’s about $50).
Weirdly enough, they’ll sometimes write “cents” on a bill or transaction, even though the smallest monetary denomination Prague has is a 1 crown coin.
Get ready to think hard every time you have to use numbers.
In casual conversations, Czechs stick to the same time scale Americans do — saying a time between 1 and 12.
In more formal communications, however, times are often communicated using military time. If you make a dinner reservation, you can call and ask for seating at 20:00. A concert may start at 19:00. Your doctor appointment is at 13:45. Czechs do not use AM and PM. Get used to reading and understanding these numbers.
Americans count on their hands starting with the pointer finger as 1. Europeans use their thumbs as 1. This means that counting to 2 on your fingers looks like a peace sign in the US, but like a finger ‘L’ for Europeans.
Americans use quotation marks that look like “this.” Czechs use ones that look like „this.”
American phone numbers have 10 digits — like (012) 345–6789. Czech phones numbers have 9– for ex. 123 456 789. As a note, the Czech country code is +420, so your entire phone number may be +420 123 456 789.
Czechs and Americans have different keyboard layouts for typing. The biggest change is that Czechs and Americans switch the places of the y and z keys on their keyboards. If you use a public computer, be prepared for immense frustration. Muscle memory is real, folks.
Czech apartment buildings don’t leave building hallway lights on, as is common in the US. They also don’t typically use automatic sensors. Instead, Czech hallways are often lined with timed light switches that you press when you enter the building. They will also be placed on every floor in the building so you can hit them as you leave your apartment. After a few nights of blindly stumbling around dark stairwells, identifying the light switch is a godsend.
On a personal note, I was too afraid to touch these when I moved here, thinking they were someone’s doorbell or that I would flood the apartments with light. Learn from my mistakes — it’s okay to press them.
Similar to the light switches, some main building doors have physical buttons that you need to press to exit. If you find yourself stupidly shoving a stubborn door, take a step back and check for an exit switch next to it.
While smoke detectors are required in basically every building in the US, they are rarely required or enforced in Czech buildings. My apartment, for example, had no smoke alarms equipped. Know this beforehand as it can be scary if you’re expecting them and they’re not there.
In the Czech Republic, you don’t have to tip, but people usually do a little (This is not true if the receipt or server indicates service is not included. In that case, see my next paragraph). The typical rule is that you loosely round up. For example, if your meal was 136 crowns, round up to 150 when you pay. If you had really great service, a tip of up to 10% is standard. Paying just for the food is fine, however, as service is built into the price.
Though not common, some places will not include service in the bill. If this happens, the receipt will indicate it. This usually only occurs in tourist areas. At that point, paying 10% would be typical.
If you tip in cash, which is always preferred, it’s standard to give the tip to the service provider directly. Leaving the tip on the table is not common practice here.
If you tip by card, you have to tell them the amount before they swipe your card. You never specify a tip on a receipt. You will always pay meal and tip together in one transaction.
If you indicate you want to pay by card, the servers will bring out a card terminal to you. You’ll then pay by card at your table.
Alternatively, they may ask you to walk with them to a register where you pay. They will never take your card and walk off. As another quirk, when ready to pay, patrons will sometimes pre-emptively walk up to the cash registers, even in a sit-down place, and wait for a host or waiter to check them out. This is faster and expected, not rude or out of place.
Further, credit card technology is different in Europe. While chip payments are the new, gold standard in the US, Europe is one step ahead with contactless payments being the norm. These are payments powered by near-field communication chips, like the stuff used in Apple or Android pay on your phone. To pay with Czech bank cards, just tap your card near a terminal and your payment will be accepted. Since you probably don’t have a Czech bank card, all this means for you is that the waiters will often fumble around with a chip payment, not have a pen on them for signing a receipt, and will ask you if your card is contactless (it’s probably not). Hopefully knowing this will lend you some patience, help you not answer “huh?” to the contactless question, and make you wonder why American banks are so behind.
Of note also is that Europeans pay almost exclusively with debit cards; credit cards are not nearly as common, though establishments will still accept them.
If you pay in cash, waiters will usually also start and finish the transaction at your table. They’ll bring a large wallet filled with bills, at which point they’ll take your cash and give change at the table.
Europe does not always cater kindly to separate checks. In the Czech Republic, often they will ask what you had and do the math right in front of you on paper to separate a bill before asking each party to pay their portion. Splitting individual items is rarely possible. The wait staff may get salty if you try to ask for complicated bill splittings.
In the US, reservations are typically only made for fancy restaurants, crowded restaurants, for large parties, or for special occasions. If you show up without a reservation, you put your name on a list and wait until you get seated.
The Czech Republic is different. In the Czech Republic, even casual restaurants take reservations. Any place, casual or not, will almost certainly be full on Fridays or Saturdays, just like the US, but Czech restaurants won’t have a wait out the door. If you don’t have a reservation and they’re full, they’ll turn you away. Even seemingly empty restaurants will sometimes tell you they’re full, as a whole bunch of reservations are about to show up and the place is consistently booked throughout the evening.
If you want to have a place to eat, especially a good one, call ahead and make a reservation.
It’s common for Czech restaurants to have shared coat stands, like a coat rack or closet. When I dine with my European friends, they’ll often look for the coat rack and hang up their belongings next to strangers’ things. This is uncommon in the US where we just throw our coats behind our chairs. I tend not to participate as I’m slightly skeptical of leaving my belongings unattended and because I will forget my coat literally every time I eat.
To non-Americans, American service staff seem disingenuous, disconcertingly friendly, and over-attentive. This is because American staff aren’t paid a living wage and depend on tips for their salary. This crazy attentive service is necessary for wait staff to dream of maintaining a standard salary and is expected by American restaurant-goers.
In Europe, the pace of restaurants is slower. Waiters are paid a working wage and aren’t dependent on tips, however much they’re appreciated. If you want a waiter’s attention, you often have to catch their eye and wave them over, as they won’t be visiting at a regular pace. When you’re done with your meal, you again have to gesture for them; they won’t be looking to swing by as soon as you’re finished. To Americans, this wait service can seem apathetic and rude.
European waiters on the whole don’t have the sticky-sweet American demeanor, but Czechs take that to a whole new level. Czech wait staff are, on a good day, uninterested. On a bad day they are downright hostile.
Personally, the disengaged and often rude service staff in the Czech Republic are one of the reasons I don’t want to stay here long-term. I miss American friendliness, however shallow, like crazy.
If you’d like a take-out box after your meal, you will be charged a small fee for the box and bag.
If you pay with an American card, you’ll be prompted during purchase on if you’d like to pay in crowns or USD. The guidance I’ve heard is that you’ll usually get a better exchange rate if you pay in the local currency. I suggest that.
Don’t let this stock image fool you. On the whole, Czech food is very bland, with a heavy emphasis on carbs and meat. There are almost no fruits or vegetables in Czech specialties. Just a lot of meat, a lot of gravy, and a lot of bread.
Dumplings are everywhere in the Czech Republic, which I was super excited about when I moved here. Turns out, dumplings here aren’t like Asian dumplings or even Polish dumplings. They’re not steamed or fried, and they don’t have any filling. They’re basically just cylinders of white bread. #disappointed
Czechs love their pate (pronounced pah-tay), which is a raw, minced-beef dish, usually served as an appetizer. You’ll see this all over the place. I may have tried it once but honestly it puts me off a little, so I can’t speak much to its taste. I have had the salmon pate, however, and that was pretty good (in my head I convinced myself it was sushi).
Not specifically Czech but found everywhere. It’s chunks of beef and pork smothered in dark gravy.
They turn their goulash dish into a soup as well! Found on menus everywhere.
A mixture of a light broth, potatoes, onions, and… garlic.
Do you like mozzarella sticks? Then you’ll love the Czech main course of fried cheese. Hold the marina sauce, though. Czechs usually serve this with some variation of tartar sauce.
This dish has nothing to do with birds, but is yet another pork dish with dumplings and gravy.
Maybe because they’re so close to Germany, Czechs have pickled cabbage all over the menu. They have two kinds: a sweeter red variety and a more sour white cabbage.
Czechs’ own version of Cola! It can come in a variety of odd flavors too, for example, melon.
Yet another meat + gravy +dumplings dish. This one, however, comes with a twist. They serve it with a citrus slice on top (usually lemon or orange), and cover that citrus slice with cranberries and whipped cream. They also sometimes bake cranberries into the dumplings on this dish as well. I’m not a believer in combining sweet with meat dishes, so I find this dreadful. Worth a shot if you’re looking for a true Czech meal though.
Two quintessential beers to try in the Czech Republic. I’m not a beer person, so please take my advice here with a grain of salt.
Czechs love eating duck, so be prepared to see it on menus galore.
Czech open-faced sandwiches that come with a variety of toppings.
Not historically Czech but delicious nonetheless. This is a pastry, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. Dough is coated in a mixture of cinnamon, sugar, vanilla, and a bunch of other flavors, then slow roasted to perfection. You can also choose the filling of your choice — chocolate, nutella, vanilla custard, ice cream — and enjoy!
Lemonade is on Czech menus galore. That said, it’s not American lemonade. American lemonade is water, sugar, and lemon flavoring. Czech lemonade is carbonated water, and a light flavoring that needs to be specified and isn’t necessarily lemon. Think of it more like a light, flavored soda. Czech lemonades will often come in a long list of flavors. Some common ones are raspberry, cucumber, and ginger. Some places may even have lemonade on the menu but not lemon-flavored lemonade. Watch out!
I don’t know if this is a Czech thing or if I’ve just had bad luck, but the few times I’ve ordered milkshakes in the Czech Republic, they’ve been the temperature and consistency of chocolate milk. I don’t know if Czechs believe in putting ice cream in milkshakes. Beware.
If you decide to visit a McDonald’s here, note that there is no ranch dressing, and most of your beloved favorite sauces aren’t there, either. The sauce menu will be different, and so will the main courses. Some standards, like fries and nuggets, remain, but the Czech menu also includes localized items like a fried camembert sandwich (camembert is a popular cheese in the Czech Republic). European McDonald’s also tend to have a much richer dessert section, including pastries, like croissants. Visiting McDonald's in different parts of the world is a treat to see how the menu is localized. Czech McDonald’s official site and menu are here.
You often see this on the menu. This is just a European word for arugula.
In America, pepperoni is a thinly-sliced sausage. In Italy and other places in Europe, pepperoni pizza means a pizza covered in bell peppers. In the Czech Republic specifically, pepperoni can sometimes mean either one. If you’re going to order pepperoni pizza, be careful to clarify which one you’re getting. If, at a place you’re visiting, pepperoni means a pizza covered in bell peppers and you want the American pepperoni pizza, look for one that has salami.
If you see pancakes written on a menu, they actually mean what Americans think of as crepes. If you want real, IHOP-style pancakes, look for American pancakes, though they are not very common in Prague.
There’s a European law that what’s written on the menu is what you pay. This means that the written price already includes tax and tip, so there will be no surprises when you pay your bill.
Beer is literally cheaper than water in the Czech Republic, which is part of the reasons tourists love it here. Remember that water is almost never free in the Czech Republic.
While smoking hasn’t been common in US restaurants in decades, Czechs can still smoke while seated outside. Smoking inside of Czech restaurants was only abolished in the last few years, and some Czechs think even that is too strict.
Americans love ice water more than Europeans, but Czechs in particular don’t like any sort of cold drink. I’ve seen Cokes served warm, and waiters will almost never serve ice by default. As a non-beer drinker I’m not sure how the beer is served, but honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if it was warm.
For whatever reason, Czechs call potato wedges American potatoes.
In Europe, eating fries with ketchup is replaced by the default of eating fries with mayonnaise. Don’t ask me.
In the US, you either get a coke in a bottle (rare at a restaurant), or coke in a glass, but never both. In Prague, they always serve glass-bottle sodas alongside a glass. This is true for any soda and even water, which is almost never free and always comes in bottles.
This name means two different candies in the Czech Republic vs the US!
If you haven’t traveled abroad before, you should know that outlets look different in different parts of the world. You’ll need an international adapter for whatever country you’re going to, to make your plugs compatible with the other country’s wall outlets. If you’re traveling with friends, bring extras, because a lot of people don’t know this. Skyscanner has a great list of which adapters work in each country. Note that these most basic ones don’t convert anything electrically, they just make the outlet shapes physically compatible.
If you’re going to use anything that requires a lot of power from the wall, you’ll also need a converter, which converts European power output to something needier American electronics can handle. You’ll need this for things like hair dryers and hair straighteners.
This article is a handy guide for when to use adapters vs converters vs transformers (transformers are covered in an upcoming article, on what to know for moving to Prague).
For reference, Prague outlets look like this:
For any more information, the gold standard is the YouTube channel Honest Guide, an effort run by two local Czechs who go into detail about everything you need to know about Prague. This includes trustworthy places to exchange money, what Czech food is like, major attractions: everything. Czech 👏🏻 them 👏🏻 out 👏🏻.
Good luck with your Prague trip planning and enjoy your time in the beautiful Czech Republic!

My Guide in the Czech Republic (main part Prague)
In this article, I am going to answer the FAQ about Prague and give you some tips about the city.
I have been living in the city for 4 years and whenever I go for a walk in the old town, I feel like it is my first time visiting the city. That’s why I decided to work as a tour guide for a while. I don’t do it anymore, except private tours from time to time.
So, let Is go through the things that you want to know before coming to the Magical City.
*I will recommend videos to watch or website(s) to visit in each section, some of the videos may don’t have accurate information such as exchange rate but the information is useful no matter when you come to Prague ;)
The Czech Republic is not in the eurozone, the official currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech crown (Kč/ in English CZK). 1 euro is around 25CZK. You will find a link to the Czech National Bank and to a website with the best exchange point in Prague in the end of this section.
Coins: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 CZK * All the coins are useful (not the case with euros — 1cent, 2cent, 5cent) Banknotes: 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 CZK
*You should avoid the 2000 and 5000 banknotes for small purchases.
Although CZK is the official currency in the Czech Republic, you still can pay by Euro almost everywhere specially in Prague. However, you will not get the best exchange rate except in the international chains (supermarkets, coffee chains, fast-food chains, …).
Czech National Bank
How to exchange money by (Honest Guide)
Prague without cash by (Honest Guide)
Public transport is efficient in Prague in a way that you don’t need a rental car or taxis. Actually, it is cheaper and faster xD. There are 3 lines of Metro, 10s of tramways, and 100s of buses.
The tickets for a single trip are for 30 minutes (for 24czk) or 90 minutes (for 32czk). The daily ticket (24h) is for 110czk and if you are here for 3 days (72h) your ticket costs 310czk.
*If you are willing to stay more than 5 days, I recommend buying a monthly ticket for 570czk
For more details check these videos:
How to buy a ticket (Honest Guide)
Travelling around the city (Honest Guide)
Prague Public Transport at Night (Honest Guide)
How to get from Prague’s airport to the city center (Honest Guide)
GOING TO PRAGUE BY TRAIN OR BUS (Honest Guide)
To find transport connection, check out this website (they have also mobile app) www.idos.cz
To rent bikes use Rekola, but you will need a credit card to use the app.
You can use Uber and yeah it is possible to pay by cash or taxi companies like Tick Tack, Nejlevnější Taxi or MODRÝ ANDĚL (if you went out with your car and end up drinking beers with your friends, they can give you a ride for you and your car xD at night).
*Ride for the airport to the city center should cost you around 500czk (20 euro), be careful from scams.
You have many options such as Hotels, Hostels, Airbnb, apartments, etc. I am going to describe the different areas by character so that it helps you choosing the right place.
Old town : you won’t need transportation since everything is close to you. However, a lot of going on around and there is a big possibility that you won’t have a calm night.
Lesser town (malá strana) : It is near the castle, Charles Bridge and many beautiful parks. You will need transportation and there are almost no supermarkets nearby (most of the prices are for tourists).
New Town : A great neighborhood, restaurants and cafés are excellent in the area. Most of your neighbors are tourists, those who hurry up are called the locals. You will need transportation and fortunately there are two metro stations in the area and many tramways pass by that zone.
The rest of the areas are cheaper, calmer (exception: Žižkov) and most of the residents are locals, so you won’t be scammed.
During my work as a tour guide, I met tens of people who planned their stay in Prague just one day or two days and double of that period in Budapest (sometimes more time for Bratislava than Prague :D). I think you know what I am going to say by now. Minimum days to spend in Prague should be 3 or 4 days. If you want to enjoy the city and yourself, one week to 10 days.
Plan A — 3 days:
You should not enter every monument/museum in your way. Consider taking transportation so that you won’t be tired by the end of the day.
Plan B — royal stay:
Life is good, you have enough time to visit the main monuments, party, enjoy the traditional Czech cuisine and save energy for the next city/country.
Plan Z — Underestimated city / just 1 night or even less
You can start by Prague Castle (don’t spend more than 60 -90 minutes in that area)than follow the Royal way (Coronation route). Next stop will be Charles Bridge that will lead you to the old Town Square. You should be tired by now from walking, so reward yourself by a hot coffee in Skautský Institut or another place (avoid the coffees in the square if you don’t want to be scammed) .
You should have enough time to enjoy a traditional dish. Later on, go to Wenceslas Square.
*This can be done the other way around (from Wenceslas Square to the Castle, but I recommend the first direction because Prague Castle in on the top of the Hill).
COOLEST DISTRICT in PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
1000czk without accommodation is fair enough. I will tell you why :
Transport: 110czk for 24h
Food: 600czk (150–200 per meal)
Coffee&cake: 150czk (coffee for 50czk, cake for 100czk)
The rest can be used for entrance to museum (sometimes it will cost you 250 czk, but generally around 150czk or less)
The list is so long, you should make your priorities. If you like museums, Prague offers museum for any kind of thing (Torture, toys, chocolate, Lego, Apple Inc.,). You love outdoors?.. well Prague offers that too, but if you can’t stand cold weather, you should visit the City during Spring or Summer Season.
The must visit list that I recommend is the following:
Charles Bridge, Prague Castle, Old Town Square, Prague Zoo, Wenceslas square, National museum, etc.
However, those are the typical ones, there are other monuments and places to visit. Check out the following videos:
PRAGUE CASTLE (Honest Guide)
10 BEST INSTAGRAM SPOTS IN PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
MUST SEE HIDDEN GEM IN THE HEART OF PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
SECRET PLACES IN PRAGUE (Honest Guide)
The traditional Czech cuisine is so authentic. The food is heavy, tasty and not healthy :D Main ingredients are meat (mainly pork), potatoes, cabbage and flour. So, don’t expect salads or vegetarian food.
The best thing that you will enjoy, in the Czech Republic, are snacks and cakes.
I recommend reading this article:
https://www.tasteofprague.com/pragueblog/traditional-czech-food-in-prague-what-to-have-and-where-to-have-it
Here is also a playlist of videos from Honest Guide that I recommend to watch (included vegetarian restaurants):
Restaurants in Prague (Honest Guide)
Safety:
The City is safe and secure, but be careful in the crowded areas. There are no ghettos or not recommended areas. The Czech Republic is one of the safest countries in the world 😊.
Halal food:
There are some restaurants that offer halal food. Most of them are near to the city center. Here is a list of the restaurants, I will try to cover all the areas in Prague:
Mangal Restaurant is located in the Wenceslas square. Address: Václavské náměstí 64, Praha
Barakat is near the mosque of the center. Address: Opletalova 28, Praha
Istanbul Kebab is also near the mosque of the center, less than 100 meters from Barakat. Address: Politických vězňů, 17, Praha
Jordan Restaurant in the lesser town (mala strana). So, if you are hungry and you still near the castle this should be your destination. Address: Malostranské náměstí 36/22, Praha
Safír is a good Lebanese restaurant. You can find it in different malls (OC Nový Smíchov, Arkády Pankrác, OC DBK — Budějovická , OC Chodov) * OC stands for Commercial Center. Here is their website http://www.isafir.cz , but it is not updated.
*if you are so into halal things, you should go 100% vegan in this country or buy expensive food from bio supermarkets/restaurants.
Different products use pork gelatin or other extracted products from pork. These products can be yogurt, sweet bakery (even croissant), etc.
If you want to have bolognaise or burger with mashed beef meat, make sure that is not mixed with pork (in non halal places).
Mosques:
Mosque of the center: Opletalova 930/28, 110 00 Praha 1 (be advised, it is located inside a building)
Mosque Alfirdaus : Na Košince 502/1, 180 00 Praha 8-Libeň
Mosque of Černý Most: Blatská 1491, 198 00 Praha 9
Other tips:
Keep in mind that the Czech Republic is in the CENTER of Europe and not in the East. Also avoid saying Czechia, no one like it.

Prague is a beautiful city. The river flows through the heart of it with the Disney-looking castle perched atop a hillside in the background. Its baroque and romanesque architecture give it an air of elegance that is incredibly unique.
The Old Town Square is the main area boasting beautiful buildings and the famous Orloj, an astronomical clock that sings at the top of every hour. It was teeming with tourists, so we didn’t stay too long in that area. And, unfortunately similar to Amsterdam, many of the streets were overflowing with trash and graffitied walls, which degraded the beauty of the city. In addition, overwhelming crowds and poor weather influenced our perception of Prague. It was obscenely hot the first few days, which gave us limited time to prance about before the sun scorched down on us and we had to take refuge inside shady cafes. But, the last few days cooled off and it even started raining out of the blue so we had to take cover again.
Despite an abundance of tourists and hot weather, we found that the best way to enjoy ourselves was by venturing out of the main town squares and finding solace along the side streets. Wandering along Old Town’s cobblestone streets was a great way to spend our time because we felt like this was more of an ideal way to experience this archetypal European city. I also had a chance to discover a specialty of Czech desserts: the trdelník chimney. It’s a funnel-cake filled with soft-serve ice cream and smells like a cinnamon roll. You can often find bakers on the streets baking the dough on a rotating spit then rolling it in cinnamon and sugar before filling it up with soft-serve. It was delicious confection for any sweet-tooth to enjoy!
In Vrtba garden, I got to see a photoshoot with a fashion model walking throughout the grounds. And I followed in her footsteps popping some poses myself.
We also got a great view walking up the steps of the Italian-style gardens and seeing the city beyond them. But, the best sights (and sounds) were yet to come…
The walk to Prague Castle was one of our favorite parts of the city. First, we started the walk from the Powder Tower, then up and over Charles Bridge. Charles Bridge is an attraction all by itself. Built in the 14th century, it’s lined with: sculptures of religious images and prolific Czech figures, street performers, artists and peddlers. It provides some of the most scenic views of the city over the Vltava River.
After crossing the bridge, we wound through cobblestone lanes and then climbed 200+ steps up to the castle entrance. Though the hike up to the castle is a bit of a workout, it’s worth it to get a spectacular view of Prague. In particular, the view at the top from the Starbucks (yep, you read that correctly; they pick the best locations!) situated in an outdoor patio setting overlooking the city was incomparable.
Once we arrived at Prague Castle, there’s no shortage of things to do. The compound includes a pretty expansive collection of eclectic buildings with museums, cafes, and archways connected by the internal castle roads. It’s a self-sufficient city unto itself similar to Windsor Castle. And, after the trek uphill we found a nice little offshoot area next to a cafe where we could sit, listen to a fountain, and cool off.
One of the best things we did was attend an organ concert in St. Vitus Cathedral, in the heart of the castle complex. St. Vitus is a 14th century Gothic church housing the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors. It’s also the home to a great organ that’s about 3 stories tall! We got to hear the prodigious instrument in all of its glory at a special evening concert. The booming sound of the pipes reverberated through the gothic arches making the church come alive! I can only imagine how awesome it must have been to the Bohemians back in the day when this baby was first installed. The event was unbelievably special, and I savored the moment listening to the sweet tempo and the rich tones of the organ. It has inspired me to start tickling the ivories once again!

A personal tour guide of Prague and Czech Republic

Prague is a hot destination for the movie production. And not only the city itself, but all Czech Republic. Especially in the last decades there are more and more foreign producers exploring the beauties of our country.
One of the main reasons why we are so popular are lower prices and tax incentives. Only in Prague you can find Barrandov movie studios, the largest film studio in the country and one of the largest in Europe, nicknamed “European Hollywood.” And, the most important, is the architecture. It offers the new and old, romantic and scary places. You do not need to travel anywhere else to find Venice, Paris or Vienna on the same street! :-)
Many, many movies were filmed in Prague and here I’m bringing you a few of them, in this limited space. It might be also a nice idea what to watch them prior coming to Prague ;-)
Mission: Impossible 1 (1996) and 4: Ghost Protocol (2011)
Nothing is impossible for Tom Cruise. To run across the Charles Bridge just within a few seconds or stealing from the Russians atPrague Castle. Large parts of these movies were shot not only in the historical centre (Old Town Square, National Museum, Wenceslas Square, Kampa Island, Municipal House…) but also in wider Prague areas — Vyšehrad Castle or Strahov Stadium.
Btw, Mission: Impossible 1 was the very first foreign movie made in Prague after the fall of communist regime.
Amadeus (1984)
Probably the best and the most known movie ever made in Prague is Amadeus. Filmed in 1984, so when we still had communistic regime, by Czech director Miloš Forman (who had to leave the country because of the same regime). The plot of the movie is set in Vienna, telling the story of two rival composers — Mozart and Salieri. It won eight Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director. That’s pretty good, isn’t it?
The best filming location to visit is the Estates Theatre, where the real Mozart premiered his opera Don Giovanni. Among others, try to stop in Wallenstein Garden, Strahov Monastery, St. Giles church or Colloredo — Mansfred Palace.
Casino Royale (2006)
Agent 007 had to make it to Prague one day, no doubt about it. Some of the place where he is walking, running and shooting were filmed in Strahov Monastery, National Museum or Prague Airport that was supposed to be… well, Miami Airport :)
Actually, most of the movie was shot in other towns, such as Loket and Karlovy Vary. Especially in Karlovy Vary, the movie makers decided to use again famous Grandhotel Pupp — that you might know from another movie, The Last Holiday with Queen Latifah and Gérard Depardieu.
Operation: Daybreak (1975) or Anthropoid (2016)
One of the most important moments in the history of WW2 is the arrival of the Butcher of Prague and his eventual assassination in 1942 by two Czechoslovakian paratroopers. There are several Czech movies dedicated to this operation. Speaking about those made in English language, you must watch Operation: Daybreak and the new Anthropoid movie, both filmed also on the authentic locations. They display the bravery of Czechs and how terrible price we had to pay.
To find out more about what really happened in 1942, join my Memorial Tour.
Child 44 (2015)
Movie based on a book that tells the story of the Russian military police (Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman) investigating a series of a child murders during the Stalin era in Russia. Movie makers decided to come to Prague especially because of the underground stations (dated back to communistic time) but also for the interiors. One of them is the National Museum. However, the director Ridley Scott did not like the facade of the National Museum and asked to repaint it. He was quite confused when the city did not allow him to do it. :)
Btw, did you know that for the filming, producers had to stop the operation of Prague’s underground? That happened for the first time in our history. You can imagine how locals were happy about it :)
Les Misérables (1998)
Probably the best version of Victor Hugo’s story and made in Prague! The cast is perfect, starring Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman or Geoffrey Rush and the setting even more splendid. For many travellers Prague really look like a small Paris and if not, it is easy to make by using film effects. That’s how the movie makers replaced St.Vitus Cathedral for Notre Dame de Paris in one scene, but in the other one you can see our Cathedral back again :)
Yentl (1984)
Barbra Streisand and the song “Papa, Can You Hear Me?”, who would not know it? It comes from the movie called Yentl that tells a story of a Jewish girl disguises herself as a boy to enter religious training. It won also one Oscar, Golden Globe and the nomination for Grammy Awards.
xXx (2002)
An extreme sports athlete, Vin Diesel, is recruited by the government on a special mission. The movie itself is nothing special, but the scene on Vltava river is pretty amazing. Also several sights from historical centre appear in the movies, such as Týn Church, Old Town Square, Municipal House or Charles Bridge.
And the winner for the Best Shot in Prague is…
The Best Offer (2013)
The story of an elderly man working in auctions, the collector or the painting, was mostly filmed in Italy. However, at the final of the movies, the main character (Geoffrey Rush) decides to come to Prague. He enters the room of the hotel, opens the window and the first thing he sees is the famous Astronomical Clock. What an amazing shot! Only afew seconds, but it makes you feel you need to come to this city. Watch and decide. :)
Btw, the restaurant mentioned in the movie. Night&Day, does not actually exist :)
Looking for more?
…and many more :)
Here you can see some photos from the streets of Prague, directly from the set. And try to guess what movies it is from :)

I’ve lived in Prague for 25 years, and I get asked pretty frequently about good things to do, so I figured I’d put it into a list.
In terms of events calendars, I’d check the Expats.cz (www.expats.cz) calendar, the Prague TV (www.prague.tv) calendar, and the Czech Tourism site (which is good, but kinda basic — http://www.czechtourism.com/home/).
Here’s something you might not know: Vietnamese culture is strong in Prague. Vietnamese are the third-largest ethnic minority in the Czech Republic (behind Slovaks and Ukrainians), and there are a number of places to get great Vietnamese food, including the sprawling SAPA marketplace (Anthony Bourdain visited there when he came to Prague a couple of years ago). SAPA is like a huge swap meet. It’s kind of hard to get to, but a really unexpected thing to find in Prague. (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/wKypyCh5AW32)
Barring that, I’d recommend visiting Banh Mi Makers on Dlouhá třida in the Old Town for a great Banh Mi sandwich. In fact, the building that houses Banh Mi Makers is a gourmet shopping center that also hosts one of the must-visit restaurants in town, the stand-up Naše Maso butcher shop Map: https://goo.gl/maps/XacKM4neyct. If you have enough lead time, I highly recommend reserving their ‘Noc s řezníkem (Night With A Butcher)’ an absolutely massive six-course
Just down Dlouhá, you have Lokal, which is a retro-style pub that serves some of the freshest Pilsner Urquell outside of Pilsen. And next door you have the Roxy and NoD spaces, which are great for catching a DJ gig or maybe a performance (check the website at www.roxy.cz).
In terms of vegetarian fare, I like the Maitrea restaurant near the Old Town Square, and Radost FX Cafe, and I highly recommend the Eska restaurant in the up and coming Karlin neighborhood. It just got a Michelin Bib Gourmand, and while it isn’t a strictly vegan restaurant, it’s a place that focuses on bread and things made with yeast or fermentation. It’s excellent.
One place that’s kinda touristy but still excellent is the rooftop bar at the Hotel U Prince, just off the Old Town Square. Walk into the hotel, all the way to the back, and you’ll find a glass elevator. Take that to the top and walk up some stairs, and you’ll be rewarded with one of the most spectacular views of the city you could ever imagine. And it’s even heated in the winter. https://www.terasauprince.com/terrace
The Maurer Grand Restaurant list (and app) has a ton of great restaurant recommendations too. http://www.grandrestaurant.cz/home/?lng=en
Prague has some great design shops if you know where to look. I especially like Tuzeks (http://tuzeks.eu/), which is a play on words on the old Communist hard-currency shops. Tuzeks sells retro Czech design (the lamps and chairs are great). https://goo.gl/maps/L7u5hKYkTG62
In the last couple of years we’ve seen a lot of design stores open up, and one of my favorites is the Chemistry Design Store (https://www.facebook.com/thechemistrydesignstore/), which has a lot of funky prints, glasswork, and some of the coolest turntables I’ve ever seen (made by 440 Audio — http://www.440audio.eu/). I also love the Modernista store in several locations, including the House of the Black Madonna. They specialize in faithful reproductions of Czech art deco, cubist and modernist pieces, and they’re gorgeous. http://www.modernista.cz/?lang=en
The Museum of Decorative Arts is also off the beaten path and is excellent, and has a wonderful museum shop, also run by Modernista (https://goo.gl/maps/1WdovwAG1Ro). Bonus: The windows, especially the ones in the stairways, overlook the Jewish Cemetery. I’m of two minds on whether the cemetery itself is worth going to. It’s usually mobbed, and it’s pretty pricey to get in. But the synagogues are beautiful. I’d instead recommend the small Jewish cemetery under the Zizkov TV tower. While there, you can check out the bar up on top of the TV tower, as well as checking out the Palac Akropolis, still my favorite concert venue in town, with two separate DJ bars.
I also like the scruffy Žižkov neighborhood where the Akropolis is located, which, pound for pound, has the highest concentration of bars, restaurants and cafes in town. That and the more upscale Vinohrady neighborhood next to it are good.
Being an old fart, I don’t get out as much as I’d like to. But when I do, I like the Naplavka riverwalk (https://goo.gl/maps/66HK8PEoGEH2) and the Krymska street neighborhood (https://goo.gl/maps/3PfbNjZEM5r). Naplavka is not so great in the wintertime, but is the place to be in spring and summer. And Krymska is ground zero for Prague hipsters. Pretty great.
Clubwise, some of Prague’s must-visit places include the Palac Akropolis (www.akropolis.cz), Roxy, Rock Cafe, Radost FX, and definitely the Cross Club, which must be seen to be believed — Atlas Obscura has a nice writeup here: http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cross-club
I live close to the up-and-coming Letna neighborhood, which is anchored by the Bio Oko arthouse cinema and cafe (https://goo.gl/maps/rLkuMmDs9YF2). That neighborhood has the National Technical Museum, a must-see for geeks (https://goo.gl/maps/a9h6YqqUp6v) and Letna Park’s beer garden (https://goo.gl/maps/Dqvzyh8HNEs), which has one of the best views in town. In between are all kinds of great cafes and bars.
I’d strongly recommend getting a metro pass for the time you’re here. It’s cheap and so much less hassle. I’d also recommend (if you have mobile data) the Google Maps app, which also gives you timetables and nearest transit stops.
Prague taxis are a total ripoff, and I definitely do not recommend taking a taxi from the street. Use one of the services instead. I use Tick Tack Taxi (www.ticktack.cz), Taxi AAA (http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/), and Uber, which works well (although, like everywhere, surge pricing is something to watch for).
If you’re heading toward Vienna, I’d recommend either Český Krumlov or Mikulov. Český Krumlov is one of my favorite places on the planet and an amazing UNESCO World Heritage site — it’s an entire town from the 14th century flawlessly preserved. Just gorgeous. Mikulov, in southern Moravia, is in the wine region, and is also a really nice place to be, moreso in summertime. Plus, there’s a nice waterpark just outside of town (http://www.aqualand-moravia.cz/en)/.
If you’re heading north toward Berlin, I’d recommend taking a day to check out Bad Schandau, a spa town with a kickass thermal bath (http://www.toskanaworld.net/web/en/therme_bad_schandau/home.asp), and the Czech and Saxon Switzerland national park, famous for its sandstone formations, including a couple of natural bridges.

Discovering Beautiful Prague Hacks
Ahoj!
Now,if you have visited the beloved continent Europe ,you already know what a gem it is for travelers.It’s almost safe to say that it is every traveler's dream destination. Not only does it have over 40 countries to be explored (most without any visa restrictions)it offers a chance to experience rich history and cultures given most European countries have different languages.This said I put myself on a challenge to explore the world a little bit more,to experience other cultures and appreciate the diversity it brings through travel and what better time to do so whilst living in Europe.This brings me to why am writing this article,I fell in love with the beautiful city Prague ever since I embarked on a 4 day trip to celebrate my birthday. It left a lasting impression because of its beauty and rich history and would like to share some hacks and tips for first time travelers based on my experience there.
1 . Pick an accommodation location that minimizes traveling
Even though Prague is a fairly affordable city in terms of cost of living ,i’d recommend finding accommodation around the namesti republiky . Here you’ll find a vast amount of key monuments within its vicinity (Kotva Department Store, Municipal House, Powder Tower, Czech National Bank and Palladium shopping mall) . In addition all other key places e.g Prague castle,National Theater,Jewish Quarter are accessible by foot hence you save on the 32czk ticket that allows you 90 mins of travel using the buses/trams/metros. However should you choose an accommodation that requires you take the public transportation i’d highly recommend taking the 3 day pass ticket that costs 310 CZK.
This is not a sponsored article but am sharing the accommodation that I stayed and felt I really had value for money
emporio-prague-apartments.com
2. Be smart when it comes to currency conversion
If you are arriving from other country you should know that Czech doesn’t use Euros and instead uses Czech koruna(CZK). Hence prior to getting here I would recommend either have some loose cash around 5 euros to change at the airport exchange bureaus which give an awfully bad rate or pay your transportation by card. Please note the ticket machines only accept coins or card.Ticket cost from the airport to the Namesti republiky city center costs 32 CZK which is an equivalent of about 1.28 euros.
Recommended Exchange bureaus that had the most competitive rates eXchange, Kaprova 14/13, 110 00 Josefov, Czechia
Alfa Prague S.r.o., Na Příkopě 957, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
Another important thing to be mindful about is the cash withdrawals or payments when using cards because of the bank conversions. Locals have recommended that its better to pay in czk than your bank currency when using a card for payments.
3.Maximize your itinerary (Use the free maps shared either in hotels or airport!)
Am sure if you google what to do in Prague in x number of days you’ll find tonnes of information. Whilst this is nice as it gives you an idea of what is available I highly recommend that you pick up the free maps offered at the airports on your way out,they are really handy in giving you a visual of where the places you ought to visit are!! I got a really cool map at the airport that had listed all the key places to visit,metro line guide and Prague city tourism information. I found this to be truly useful as it enabled me make an optimized visit schedule since I could see the location of each place I wanted to visit and the proximity to other places.
4.Book a free tour prior to arriving
You’d be amazed at how much you learn about Czech through these free tours which at the end you give whatever amount you see best.
Fun fact : Did you know which music Neil Armstrong took to the moon? wait for it…Antonín Dvořák’s New World Symphony is the answer! :) .He was a famous Czech composer. I didn’t know this until i had this tour :p.
Link to the free tour that i used
freewalkingtourprague.eu
5.Eat,Explore,Reflect and Repeat
Travelling is fun but even better when we can use that chance to learn about a new culture and people. Explore the local foods and experiences ,you must agree having Italian cuisine in Prague is probably a not so good idea. Also take time to reflect and appreciate the precious moments and memories made in the new place.
My short recommended list of top foods and things to do
Hidden gem I stumbled upon :Restaurace U Dvou Velbloudů, Kožná 474, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
Hidden gem i stumbled upon :Naše maso, Dlouhá 727/39, 110 00 Staré Město, Czechia
There are two points at the Charles bridge that you can make a wish (Statue of St John Nepomuk and the statue in the picture below) :) i made my wish for …
If you are a lover for animals this is totally worth it !. For (250 CZK) as entrance fee, I got to see so many amazing animals and reconnect with mother nature through the trail walks.
Accessing the Prague castle courtyards and gardens is free. The golden lane is free to access after closing hours (please note that the houses aren’t accessible however). Whilst you have plenty to do I highly recommend buying one of the tickets to access some Prague castle structures.Depending on which circuit you choose you either pay 350 CZK or 250 CZK. I chose to go with the circuit B ticket that gave me access to the Old Royal Palace,Basilica of St.George,Golden Lane and the St.Vitus’s Cathedral. There is so much history in these places and for a moment at the golden lane I felt as if I traveled back in time.
There’s so much to share and this is definitely not exhaustive . However I shared my top hacks I believe are handy for first time travelers to Prague. Thank you for taking time to read this article and don’t forget to share your Prague stories.
Dekuji!!

We had explored many places before going to Prague because of our love to discover new places. Some of the places I list below are the places we had previously explored, and some of them we found by chance. PS: We tried to explore some concept places rather than the most popular places on this trip.
Cafefin is not a breakfast place where you can spend hours as we are used to. For example, you wake up so early, you’re in a hurry, you want to have a healthy and delicious breakfast. Then here is the right address! This busy and popular cafe is the first Vietnamese coffehouse in Prague. There are mini tables and the stools at the long bar that you can sit. The staff are incredibly friendly. The Vietnamese baguette category in the menu attracted our attention. Baguette varieties were not the kind we were used to, but I have to say that I liked it very much! The cafe is also known for its sweet chao rice and homemade yoghurt with black rice.
The weather was very cold in April. Therefore, when we were too cold, we would urgently sit in any café we found by chance. That’s also how we discovered Tricafe. :) Tricafe was such a pleasant place that we have wanted to stay for 2 hours. We felt like we were at home with old-looking wooden tables, armchair seats in our grandmothers’ house and rocking chairs. You could read books from their library or you could take a glance at drawings on the wall as a mini exhibition. By the way their coffee was pretty good.
Trdelnik has started to spread after Easter markets that were established in Czech Republic in 2002 and it has become one of the symbols of Prague. We have gone to Prague during Easter so we had the opportunity to experience it in the Easter markets. Trdelnik is made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick, then grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix. I’ve tried the Nutella version of it. You can find different versions of Trdelnik in various shapes and with different flavors. Especially in the summer, you can find Trdelnik with different kinds of ice cream in Prague.
Restaurant Bella Vista has the best view in the city. Its panoramic view stretches from the Petrin Tower all the way to Prague Castle Hillsides. It streches from the west to the north, it provides spectacular views of greenish copper cupolas, narrow cobblestone streets, bridges connecting both river banks and green gardens from red-roof tops of centuries-old houses. Actually, we had come here to visit the Strahov Monastery. After the visit to the monastery, this amazing view has made our day! We couldn’t leave there without drinking a green lager to the accompaniment of this view.
Kantyna is a restaurant where you can taste great meats in Prague. In the entrance part, you can choose the meats that you would like to eat in the butcher section or if you are in a hurry, you can prefer the meats that are already cooked. We chose to choose our meat from scratch and we started to wait at our table. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages are also available, but we wanted to try local beer with our meats. This was the first place we stopped by after we got off the plane. We were very lucky because this place was so close to the hostel. Since I got back from Prague, I’ve been telling everyone about this place. The meats were absolutely incredibly delicious.
Cafe Slavia was the place where Nazım Hikmet had written some poems in Prague. There is a portrait of Nazım Hikmet which is painted by one of the Czech artists. However, the place also inspired many important literary artists. Kafka also had been going to this cafe while writing his novels.
First of all, if you want to go this place, you have to make a reservation. That’s why we’ve waited too long to sit, but the friendly staff was really helpful. I really like their food presentation. They served a meat with a kind of bread that they called “knedliky” and cranberry marmalade. It was really delicious!
I’m a real John Lennon fan and that’s why I don’t recommend this place. We really wanted to have a drink at John Lennon Pub. However, we could not spend more than 10 minutes. Due to the fact that the waiters didn’t let us have a drink here. They said we could sit here if we ate something. If we only wanted to have a drink, we couldn’t sit even if there were available tables inside. There wasn’t anything there to connect with John Lennon except his photos. I would love to have waiters understand and embrace his spirit.
The Hemingway Bar is the most popular cocktail bar in Prague. This place deserves all highest points because of the friendly waitresses and the wide cocktail menu. The name of the cocktail in the photo is Snow Globe. I used to like to watch the snow globe when i was a kid. I felt the same feelings because of this cocktail. Watching the coconut particles brought me back to my childhood. If you travel to Prague, I’d say that you should go to Hemingway Bar.
Enjoy your trip!

My first trip to Prague was in 2015, and I have been living in Prague almost for a year now. Considering the touristic season is already here (it was more than 20 degrees whole week!), I thought I should better create a post answering questions that I get from friends about visiting Prague and share the places I visited for the last 3 years with you all.
This post is ideal if you are planning to visit Prague for a short amount of time (more than a day, less than a month) and want to visit the key places of the city according to my experience. The post is not giving clear transportation methods (how long it takes from A to B, which trams go there etc), and only intends to initiate a list of places that I find worth visiting at your first Prague trip.
Prague has a beautiful Old Town (Staré Mesto) and it is a perfect place to start your trip. There you can see the Prague Astronomical Clock (currently being renovated until August 2018) which is the oldest functioning astronomical clock in the world. You will find its place in old town by just joining the always-waiting tourist groups in front of the clock because every hour twelve apostles appear from small windows of the clock. This parade takes almost a minute and is definitely worth watching. If you want to read more about the figures and the apostles of the clock, read here.
After you walked around the Old Town, you can move to Charles Bridge (Karlův most) which is one of the bridges that crosses the Vltava River. The historical bridge hosts 30 sculptures and sculpture groups on its walls. Although it is the most crowded place in the daytime due to the heavy interest of tourists, you would not want to miss the view from the bridge and the daylight look on the sculptures. I recommend visiting the bridge again in the evening to experience the charming lit version of the bridge and the beautiful city under the evening lights one more time.
From the Charles Bridge you can connect to Kampa Island. There is a little channel called Čertovka (Devil’s Channel) with an old mill (not functioning anymore). Around the old mild there is a Vodník (can be translated as Water Demon) sitting and watching for the possible souls to store in porcelain bottles* :) At the same time, this happens to be my favourite part of Kampa Island. Also, there is a restaurant next to the mill, and it has a cute balcony and two tables outside, by looking to it I always think it can be good choice for a romantic dinner ❤
* In Czech folklore, it is believed that evil vodníci (plural of vodník) try to drown people when they happen to swim in their territory and store the souls of the drowned in porcelain bottles.
From the little channel bridge, you can walk to John Lennon Wall. In my opinion, currently it looks like more of a name+surname wall of the people who sprayed their names onto the wall, but it should be seen for the worthy cause of the wall, against wars, and inspired by John Lennon’s peaceful acts.
Kampa Park is very pretty in the spring, a must-see for visitors in summer. You can see bronze statues of three crawling babies*, by the Czech sculptor David Černý and have some photos with them like I did :) The sculptor is known as a controversial artist and you can find his installations at many different spots in Prague. For example, he is the artist behind the famous Head of Franz Kafka and Man Hanging Out; the man in the subject is Sigmund Freud who was born in Moravia, depicted as hanging by one hand not sure if to hold onto or let go.
* There is an ugly TV tower in Prague and some of the crawling babies added on it to make it a bit prettier. If you happen to visit TV tower area, you can see the crawling babies climbing to the tower :) The babies that climb to the tower are made from fiberglass, a bit lighter than their bronze siblings at Kampa Park :)
While you are at Kampa Island, you can visit Museum Kampa, one of the many modern art museums in Prague. I haven’t visited the museum myself but it is on my to-do list. You should find Kampa’s yellow penguins as they are pretty cute and don’t forget to check them again in the evening because they are also lit!
Another must-see place, and also very popular by all tourists, is Prague Castle (Pražský hrad). The castle complex is really big and considered the largest ancient castle in the world and St. Vitus Cathedral is situated within the complex. You can also get one of the best views of Prague from the walls surrounding the castle complex. I am known to take more photos whenever we visit the castle area with our guests who visit the castle for the first time :)
But what I like the most about the castle is the surrounding gardens. Awesomely designed gardens make spring/summer or for that matter any good weather trip worthwhile! Currently, as you can see at the first photo of the post, spring is very inviting, and the castle gardens are full of nice trees, flowers and awaking greens ❤ You can check all the gardens listed here: https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle-for-visitors/gardens
Talking about castles and nice weathers, I also recommend visiting Vyšehrad (means upper castle in Czech). From Vyšehrad, you can get an amazing river view one which you can’t get from Prague Castle. Probably by now, you already know that I can get very excited about city gardens, and as expected from me, I very much liked Vyšehrad gardens, too ❤
Prague is full of parks and gardens, and I am very grateful that I am living in a city that everybody can access the green areas easily! We (me and my husband) are living in Vinohrady (means vineyards in Czech) and the closest park to us is Grébovka. As declared in the name of Vinohrady, Grébovka also has one remaining vineyard from the many historical vineyards once covered all park area in the 14th century. The vineyard has a cute wooden gazebo restaurant & wine bar where they can also have weddings :) And my favourite part of the vineyard is that it also has a winery where you can get the wine of the same vineyard ❤
In my opinion, Grébovka is the most romantic park in Prague and we enjoy our evening walks (even more romantic, thanks to the authentic street lamps of Prague ❤) there. If you’re staying in the same area, I recommend checking this park as well, if you like daylight park visits more, picnic season is already open!
Up until now, I listed almost all the basic touristic must-see places in Prague. If your trip is 2–3 days long, you possibly have enough places to discover in the city. But if you are more like nature-lover type and prefer doing outdoor activities maybe you can also check the nature parks I enjoyed visiting.
Divoká Šárka (Wild Šárka) is a nature reserve and named after a female mythological warrior Šárka. There is a small canyon in the park, and it is pretty good for trekking. As a plus, you can also have a nice view after you climb the hill. It is a perfect place for enjoying nature in Prague without getting too far* from the city.
* From where we live, it takes about an hour to get there, but it totally worths the effort.
Stromovka is a very beautiful and large park. It was established in the 13th century as a game reserve and converted into a park later in 19th century. The park has a style of an English landscape garden, and there is a pond that I liked very much spending time around it.
Prokopské údolí (Prokop Valley) is an amazing place to see and from where we live it takes almost the same time as Šárka to go there. There are two small rivers, a beautiful lake, and a natural reserve area. There are playgrounds for children and benches to rest if you want to have a rest. When we first visited the area, I fell in love with nature there, and I want to visit as much as possible this year.
These are all my favourite outdoor spaces so far and let me know if you can suggest some more for me to visit this year!
Before we finalise the post, I want to mention two places I saw families with kids enjoying their time there, and you might want to add these places to your travel plan if you have children.
Disclaimer: We don’t have a child so that I don’t have a personal experience in any of the places that I recommend from a child-friendly view. I just thought it might give some ideas to the guests with kids.
Prague Zoo is a very good place to visit, even if you are not a child nor have a child :) But I highly recommend, if you have a child ❤ The admission price for a family of 4 (2 parents + 2 children) is 600 CZK (about 24 EUR — April 2018). I usually have mixed feelings about the zoos but this one does not feel like an animal prison, instead, the animals have a lot of space, they wander seemingly freely and inspire kids to learn about them in a natural looking and feeling setup. When I visited the zoo in 2015, I thought except polar animals all animals are doing fine, but the condition of polar animals did not seem enough to me to support them in Prague hot summer :(
I know, Prague Zoo was seriously damaged when the flood hit the city in 2002, and hope the animals will get better treatment after the flood’s effects completely reverted.
My second suggestion for families with kids would be visiting Mořský svět (Sea World) Aquarium. It was relatively small and boring for adults but kids were having a lot of fun there when we visited the aquarium in 2016. The ticket price for a family of four is 850 CZK (about 34 EUR — April 2018).
Overall, I think Prague is an enchanting city with its different styles of architecture from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era. Dark towers, colourful and unique style of historical buildings, doors, windows, bridges, and cobblestone streets (unpack those high heels now!) carries the memories of a long eventful history. Prague also offers a great deal of green within the city with parks and natural areas. I think everyone can find a reason to love Prague and bring good memories back to home, or maybe make it their new home ❤

Chronicalling trips, collecting tips + tricks to make travel come alive.

The first time I travelled to the Czech Republic was in the early 1990s. Communism was collapsing and, despite the obvious scars of decades of oppression, there was hope in the air. Modern and democratically leaning, Czechia (yes it’s really called that now) along with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia (or the Visegrad Group) showed promise in bridging the East-West divide. I’ve travelled back many times since, happily noting the transformation of Prague from a city behind the Iron Curtain to a modern, upbeat, western city that has retained cool elements of its communist past.
To me, no neighbourhood displays this better than Žižkov — a grittier, historically working-class quarter infused with hipster cafés, craft brew pubs, and cool retro designers. With its awesome blend of old and new Prague, Žižkov is not to be missed.
FRIDAY4PM Shake off the jet lag with a nice walk in Park Rajská Zahrada and stop by the beer garden for a quick refreshment before heading out to dinner.
6PM Nothing beats jet lag better than Czech comfort food and a well poured beer. Head to Hostinec U Vodoucha, a classic hospoda packed with locals, for an authentic experience. I suggest the Pork Knuckle (189 koruna) and a pint of Mordýř 12° (45 koruna). The richness of the pork combined with the pickled veggies and a good lager to wash it down can’t be beat.
9 PM After dinner walk back to Namesti Jiří z Podebrad to take in nighttime views of the church, Kostel Nejsvětějšího Srdce Páně, and then head underground to BeerGeek. A craft brew house that’s constantly rotating its great selection of draft beers, they also offer small bites including a HUGE selection of chicken wings (monkey wings) that pair perfectly with what’s on tap. The bar’s warm, fun atmosphere draws people in and it can get pretty crowded on a Friday night so if you’d rather climb back into bed, check out their selection of to-go beers.
SATURDAY9AM Rise and shine! Žižkov is home to Vitkov Hill, a national monument to Jan Žižka’s victory over the Crusaders in 1420. It’s also a great place to take a quick run or hike to wake up. If you climb to the top you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of Prague from the base of the massive equestrian statue of Jan Žižka.
11 AM Refreshed, and having taken in the stunning views of Prague head back down to My Coffee Story. A modern, neighbourhood coffee shop that serves great espresso and a nice selection of breakfast foods. Try the soft boiled eggs, Tri vejce ve skle, (135 koruna) or the homemade waffle with fresh fruit and mascarpone (110 koruna) to get your morning started off right.
1PM Žižkov is home to some great up-and-coming local designers. A few of my favorite shops include the über hip, cult, Czech bag brand, Playbag on Borivojova and Botas 66 on Krizkovskeho, which carries a wide range of runners, designed after Communist era Czech sport shoes, Botas or botasky. With new designs ranging from whimsical rainbow to classic brown leather this stop is sure to be a hit no matter what your style.
Let the Communist exploration continue with a visit to Bohemian Retro, a vintage shop specializing in items from pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. Despite the selection being a little more tired than I remember, it is still worth a quick stop. A more modern assortment of women’s wear can be found at SugarBat, which carries a wide variety of retro clothing that they describe as “pin-up, rockabilly and goth styles.” Nearby, on Mánesova, lingerie designer Zuzana Kubickova’s showroom and studio has a stunning selection of women’s intimates along some beautiful outerwear collections.
3PM Czechs love to grab coffee and a sweet afternoon snack. Stop by the newly opened Donut Shop and grab a coffee and brown-butter (56 koruna), or maple-bacon (54 koruna) doughnut to-go. Do as the locals do, and head back to the many benches at the square to enjoy your snack while you take in the sites and do a little people watching.
4PM Freshly refueled, or perhaps in need of another cup of coffee, saunter on over to Jirak Farmer’s Market. Described by Taste of Prague as “one of the best things to do in Prague,” this quaint market has the rare distinction of being on Wednesday to Saturday. The food and decorations change with the season, and the selection of fresh fruits, meats, coffee, wine and hot food items in fabulous. People rave about the crepes from Galetka, and the coffee from Kavovy Klub.
5PM End your shopping experience with a visit to NeverEnough. The local design shop sports an in-house bar, great music and friendly staff. Grab a cocktail or beer while perusing NeverEnough brandwear (my favourite) in addition to a more limited selection of shirts from several European designers.
8PM For upscale food in a relaxed environment, head to Riccardo Lucque’s La Bottega Gastronomica. The airy bistro has perfect window seats overlooking Mahlerovy Sady Park which makes for great people watching while enjoying the fine selection of delicious daily dishes, homemade pasta and divine wines.
SUNDAY10AM A visit to Prague wouldn’t be complete without a classic Czech breakfast of koláč from Antoninovo Pekarstvi. Be sure to try the makovy (poppy seed), and tvaroh (similar to cottage cheese), as well as the seasonal fruit selection. Apricot is always a favourite.
Noon The strange, somewhat ugly TV tower, with freaky climbing babies, built on an old Jewish cemetery defines Žižkov’s (and Prague’s) landscape. To catch a wonderful last bird’s eye view, take the elevator to the observatory (230 koruna) where you can watch films about Prague.
WHERE TO STAYAirBnB has a great selection of apartments for rent that are perfectly located to enjoy the most of Žižkov. Use this link to get a $40 credit!

musings from a solo trip around the world

I always thought eastern Europe would be cold and grey and Prague is no exception. But, as I walk past grungy stone walls under a slate sky, I notice the city’s canvas begin to fill with color. Each loud scarf or alleyway stencil builds anticipation toward my colorful destination, The Lennon Wall. However, as I weave through the side streets of this quiet, cobblestoned neighborhood in search of this mural homage to the late Beatle’s front-man, the wall is nowhere to be found! Just before I turn to my map for guidance, I spot a huddle of travelers staring at a simple message written across whitewashed facade in the distance. “Wall Is Over.”
All that remains from this crowdsourced feat of artistic expression were these big block letters. What a buzz kill! But then, as I look closer, I see a streak of fresh paint coloring the outline of an umbrella in the bottom right corner. Maybe this is a more apt portrait of Prague’s beauty. A place with a medieval core spared from world-war destruction, a towering castle beyond the reach of any mere mortal, and a body of citizens freed from communism just 15 years prior still teems with the rumblings of creative individuality. Just hours after the wall was painted over, as is customary practice every four years, the people have already begun to fill the space with life.
Prague is alive. The buildings’ imposing exteriors contain the thumping passion of proud Czechs. I could hear the city’s collective effervescence in the the fraternal “Čau!” as anyone enters or leaves a room or through the cracked window of an underground pub. The beer is cheap, tasty, and omnipresent. More signs for Pilsner Urquell (the local water) fill the streets than stoplights. With early sunsets, bars that never close, and pints that range from $1–1.50 USD, it is no wonder Prague’s happening nightlife is no secret to the world. One simply needs to step outside to hear packs of fashionable young people that make the streets feel like the hallways of the United Nations. To walk the streets is to share a drink with both the buildings and their inhabitants — each additional round bringing you closer to the city’s pulsing soul.
It is hard to decide whether the streets are more beautiful by day or by night. By day, the signature burnt orange roofs that top the baroque buildings give the old town a sense of cohesion, as if to cross the Charles Bridge is to step into a 14th century universe. By night, streaks of light shoot up Gothic facades like shooting stars, creating long shadows that imbue even the most ordinary storefront with a sense of magic. The Vlatava River snakes through the city like a moat for the Castle, while trams carry the lifeblood that courses through the city’s veins. Prague’s hip energy remains inclusive and accessible. Like leaving a dinner party at the house of an incredibly welcoming host, I felt a sense of home that demands a speedy return.

My ranking: 4.5 stars out of 5
Heading to Prague, Czech Republic? My top pool pick is the Podolí Swimming Stadium. There are a number of pools to choose from including the newish Aquacentre Šutka but I have selected the Podolí pool as #1 as it is historically interesting and the 3 pools are amazing.
The pool complex was built in the 1960s on the site of a former quarry mine along the river Vltava. It was recently added to the national cultural monuments of the Czech Republic.
You have three pools to explore here! The complex features both an outdoor AND indoor 50m pool, a 33m long outdoor diving pool, a huge spiraling slide, a steam room, a Finnish sauna (wood-burning stove), a solarium, a rehabilitation centre and a restaurant. I am a big fan of swimming rehabilitation so it was nice to see the rehab services prominently displayed. We don’t promote this much externally in BC/Canada?
The inside pool (pictured above) is designed with a big wave along the roof by Czech architect Richard Podzemny. The large viewing area for the outdoor pool is situated on top of the wavy roof. The pool is deep, clean and well maintained with crystal clear water. You need to go through the warm drying off area, showers and then wash your feet as you exit to the pool, which helps keep the water nice and clean.
I had a fantastic swim in each of the pools on a hot summer evening. My favourite was the indoor 50m which was quiet and peaceful as everyone was outside enjoying the sun.
I was surprised at the lack of lifeguards! For 3 pools they had two lifeguards in bright orange shorts (that we saw; perhaps it was a shift change or they’re in disguise?). However, the lifeguards were very active in patrolling and telling people what not to do such as jumping off the side edge into the pool. They may or may not have blown the whistle at my kids.😬
The change rooms are old and Soviet-era looking but they have modernized the locker system. When you arrive you’re given a wrist band (pictured here below on my son). You use this to enter and exit the facility and it connects to a locker of your choice. Very cool!
One interesting thing is that this pool is connected to Czech Television at the top of the hill, improving the energy use of both. Cold water is pumped up to the TV building to cool down the studio rooms and servers. The heated water is then pumped back to the stadium and heats up the pool. The water never drops below 26C, even in the outdoor pool in the winter.
Finished your swim? Make sure to stop by the restaurant on-deck and pick up a pint of beer and “Nakládaný Hermelín” (Czech marinated cheese — a classic Czech pub food, one of my favourites).

Prague, the international gateway of Czechia, is just one of the highlights of a proper tour of our exciting country. The tourist map lists more than 500 independent sites throughout Czechia, including spas, places of the UNESCO World Heritage list, protected historical towns and cities (Kutná Hora, Telč, Český Krumlov, Slavonice, Třebíč, Tábor, Písek, Olomouc, České Budějovice, Brno) open-air museums, folk architecture, castles, palaces, monasteries, pilgrimage sites, and historic ruins. Czechia is also known for its museums, puppetry and marionette exhibitions, and spa towns , famous Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), Mariánské Lázně, Jáchymov, Jeseník, and many others.
The architectural heritage is presented by spectacular Baroque, Art Nouveau, Cubism, Pre-Romanesque and other historical epochs buildings, castles and chateaux, notably the largest ancient castle in the world — the Prague castle, Karlštejn, Český Krumlov, Křivoklát, Litomyšl, Kroměříž, Zvíkov, Bouzov, Bítov, Vranov, Lednice (Lednice-Valtice cultural landscape) and many more. In Czechia is over 2000 castles and chateaux.
For the outdoor activity and photography lovers, apart from the romantic countryside around Prague and the plentiful nature of Moravia, there are nature reserves and protected areas offering regeneration, relaxation, and cures such as the Bohemian Paradise (Český ráj), Šumava, Giant Mountains (Krkonoše), Bohemian Switzerland rocks, Bohemian Middle-Highlands, etc., etc.; Aquapalace Praha, the biggest water park in Central Europe.
There are also beautiful wine-growing areas (wine villages) which offer sampling products and to visit those has become a kind of a tourist ritual for they also have a spectacular architectural style — distinctive small household wine cellars , some partially underground, others with hut-like construction.
Tourist usually appreciate: Magnificent castles and old towns, excellent hiking and cycling paths, affordable spas, interesting folklore and excellent food, beers (here are many lager beers available, including the original world famous Pilsen (Pilsner) beer and Budvar), and good wines……

Last weekend I had the pleasure to spend two wonderful days in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. It was my second time there but I was shocked because of the beauty of the city. My first time there has been in winter, therefore it was a completely different atmosphere now with sunshine in the middle of the summer.
I visited Prague with my boyfriend and despite hours of sightseeing and enjoying summer vibes there was one thing that we both realized quite soon when we arrived.
Most of the people seemed completely unhappy and were extremely unfriendly.
As we are both entrepreneurs by heart we are always curious and constantly looking around for new learnings, even during our travels. Also when sitting on the train to Prague we were talking about what exciting things we were probably going to discover and how we could make a business out of those things but what we actually found out was quite different.
I did not do any research on this and probably we, by coincidence, met a couple of the few unfriendly people in Prague but it was significantly obvious, thus I want to share our experiences.
In fact, Viennese people are told to be extremely impolite people. Viennese cafès even have the most impolite waitresses, that’s something…

A personal tour guide of Prague and Czech Republic

Many tourists wonder how Prague could survive the war without any significant damage. Not that much true though, but comparing to other cities in Europe, Prague was one of the lucky ones. In this post I would like to take you for a virtual tour to tell you more about what you can experience on my Memorial Tour. Just in case you are still note decided to book.
Memorial Tour usually starts next to the Municipal House. This is the best place to talk about changes in our history, how we transformed from thousand years old Czech Kingdom to Czechoslovakian Republic and how Nazis took control over the country. The Municipal House was the location of the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence in 1918. It is here, where literally, the freedom was born.
Let’s immerse to the streets of Old Town and talk about how life changed under Nazi rule. Did you know, that in the first days of occupation, Nazis ordered a change-over to a right-hand traffic system, and we had only 9 hours to prepare for it? Many brave people joined protests that culminated in November 1939 when all Czech universities were closed and over 1200 students were sent to Nazi concentration camps. We will see the Charles University, the symbol of democracy and fight for the freedom.
There are so many brave people that put their lives for our country. Many of them were members of the resistance, many others died in the last days of the war when they stood against Nazi occupiers. Streets of Prague were full of barricades from any material they could find — cobblestones, furniture, cars… We will see the traces of this fights, that are still visible — you just have to know where to look. And of course, we will also talk about the Jewish community and their members, who were send to various concentration camps all over Europe. Did you know, that Nazis made a decision to protect all synagogues, just to use them as their museums?
The major part of our Memorial Tour will be about one of the bravest actions that was ever done — Operation Anthropoid. The Butcher of Prague or The Blond Beast are two (of many more) nicknames of Reinhard Heydrich, the new governor of Czech lands. He arrived to Prague in 1941 and immediately started persecutions of Czech political and intellectual personalities. He also gave orders to establish a ghetto and to start with the Jewish transports. He eventually paid for all what he did to Czechs in 1942 when two Czechoslovakian paratroopers from the resistance tried assassinate him. To know how it all happened we will visit the church of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in New Town district.
Are you interested to know more, to see it all? Just join me for Memorial Tour.
P.S. I will try to show you also the Petschek Palace. This building was build shortly before the WW2 for the merchant banker Julius Petschek, with all the modern gadgets such as tube post or paternoster lift. During the Nazi occupation the Palace became the Gestapo headquarters. The horrific tortures and interrogations took place in its basement, and there is a small exhibition about what happened in the rooms nowadays. Petschek Palace is used by the Ministry of Trade and Industry today, therefore the visit is only on request.
Are you interested to know more, to see it all? Just join me for Memorial Tour provided by Prague Journeys.

Travelling through Europe had always been a dream for me — not as part of a typical group tour with strict itineraries, but as a slow, meandering journey where I experience different countries getting a feel for the life in this continent.
This was my third trip… and towards the end of the trip I felt something very unexpected.
It was something that I’d never seen in travel vlogs or read in blogs that walk you through the adventures and experiences of Europe.
I was in Prague — it was my last day of the trip. I was walking over the beautiful bridge that connected old town with the extravagant Prague castle. The atmosphere was very lively, people walking around joyfully with live music being played at every corner. The weather was pleasant too and I was surrounded by the best landscape of river, mountain, and the beautiful Prague castle.
And yet — I wasn’t mind-blown.
I hate to admit it — but it all felt… normal. Not because the city was dull or unimpressive. On the contrary, Prague is one of the most beautiful places I have seen.
It was an amazing vibe, so much so that it made me feel guilty for not being surprised or mind blown by the ambience. An ambience that anyone would die to experience.
I realized this was happening to me because I had seen so many beautiful cities, wonderful architecture, and gorgeous landscapes that my brain had subconsciously normalized it.
My brain had adjusted itself to this new reality, and all the beautiful places had unknowingly become my new normal.
It was like eating your favorite ice cream every day only to find out that it doesn’t excite you anymore.
I learned something new that evening in Prague — even the best things or the best places we see or experience in life cease to excite you or offer surprise spark after a point.
It stops being special.
I had always dreamed of seeing the Swiss Alps, climbing the Florence cathedral dome, watching the sunset from the Prague castle — and all those things were truly amazing — but now that I was on the right side of all those experiences — everything else felt just normal.
In fact, when I look back at all achievements or special moments of my life — they all had eventually subsided and became mundane. When I got my first job, or started living in my dream city, or when I first started dating — all the feelings that excited me beyond imagination at first started to feel ordinary when they became reality.
Perhaps, the moment you accomplish your goals — your brain normalizes it. Sparks begin to fade; you aren’t surprised or mind blown anymore and it feels just routine.
Think for yourself, the life that you are living now, in this exact moment, was a life that your younger self would’ve dreamt of… and yet it feels just another day today.
Having said that — know that just because your brain normalizes something doesn’t mean it isn’t an achievement that you should stop being proud of. It simply means life has used that achievement as a conduit to move upward and you have outgrown yourself.
You now have bigger ambitions and bigger desires that excite you.
So — don’t dismiss your efforts or take your achievements for granted just because it feels normal now.
The younger version of me — the one who dreamt of travelling, doing everything from solo adventures to group outings — would be in awe of everything I’ve experienced today.

Žižkov, Anděl, Budějovická, Hradčanská, Staroměstská, Náměstí Míru, Háje…?
What do these weird Czech names mean and how does the area look like?
Prague is divided into districts, as you may already found out, those districts are divided into smaller parts with a specific name and also specific lifestyle you can experience.
During my Prague´s life I have lived in many various parts of the Prague city. I was also lucky enough to meet with wide range of experiences Prague can offer. After all I have decided to share my point of view and try to do a short, but hopefully an accurate review about those different districts.
Now, let´s come back to our — still for now — unknown Prague´s district called Prague 3 or in Czech Praha 3: if you are already in crazy mood of your Erasmus and want to practice Czech language, you nerd!
The district includes officially most of the cadastral area of Žižkov and parts of Vinohrady, Vysočany and Strašnice.
This district varies a lot as you move from one site to the oppossite one. Around “borders” with other districts, like Prague 2 (Vinohrady), Prague 10 (Strašnice) and Prague 9 (Vysočany) it lives their own life. Žižkov, the main part of P3, is less international than P2 or P1. You will also come across some really old and damaged buildings or even abandoned, but that´s what makes its spirit.
When I was going through this area I felt like in 80´s in Czech republic, life after the revolution.
It´s a calmer area, older Czech people are living here, but don´t worry, you won´t feel like in a retirement home. There are many cafes around and pubs as well. You should check out Café Pavlač, for instance!
Žižkov and P3, in general, offers a wide range of flats for rent. Flats are mainly less expensive, situated in older tall buildings — typicall for Czech republic. As I am mentioning in a Lifestyle paragraph, you will meet older people with their dogs, also some Gypsies, however you can still live in a luxurious flat and rock a world from Vítkov hill or Žižkov´s tower (highest peek in Prague by the way).
Itself is a bit different. I would express it as more Czech not so international part, a bit older, not playing a theatre for tourists. It is also more industrial with older buildings. Its highlight is certainly Vítkov park — if you want to feel a true history as a though guy, go there! At the hill took a place one of the main battles of Hussite wars. If you are still being nerdy, calm down, I have not forgotten, Žižkov is also an area of Franz Kafka — a famous Czech writer! By the way the name Žižkov comes from a name Jan Žižka, who was Czech general and Hussite leader, follower of Jan Hus — simply a though guy with one eye.
As you see above, Žižkov area also offers some architecture craziness as climbing babies at a tower, but also many interesting corners for you to observe in old Prague.

Prague is truly remarkable. For me, it will always be the most beautiful city in the world. Even though I have spent the majority of my life in Prague and should know the city inside-out, there is always something astonishing to learn!
Upon my research, I found that there’s much more to this stunning city than most residents will ever realise. Here are 8 things that I didn't know about this gem!
Prague's Jewish Quarter is one of the most popular areas, it includes the cemetery and Europe oldest synagogue. It is said that Adolf Hitler planned to retire in Prague and preserve this area as a museum to an extinguished race, that is why he didn’t destroy it when he had a chance.
Currently, the Jewish Museum in Prague manages this collection of 6 synagogues, historical relics, and a Holocaust memorial.

By Jacques Poitras
MATT WELCH WAS back in Prague for the Party at the End of the World. It was March 1, 1995, and the newspaper and the life he had created for himself were crumbling in the old cobblestone streets of the Czech capital. Prognosis, the English-language rag he had launched five years earlier with a few friends, had ceased publishing; tonight, a final, drunken bash would send it off into history.
Before heading to the party at Rock Club Bunkr, a bar housed in a former Communist nuclear bomb shelter, Welch, some of the other founders, and a few friends ducked into U Vejvodů, a traditional Czech pub. They reminisced about all the struggles going back to the beginning. Charlie Hornberger, the paper’s last editor-in-chief, described closing down the office. Welch shared anecdotes from the Budapest Business Journal, where he’d taken a job two months earlier. At their feet sat bundles of newspapers: the cover of the final issue of Prognosis showed a Communist-built apartment complex crumbling under the headline “The End.”
That possibility had been looming for months, even years. Prognosis had never made a single koruna in profit. Then again, that had never been the point. “Though it misfired and miscued on more than one occasion,” Welch wrote in a goodbye essay, “Prognosis at its full bloom was one of the most ferociously good newspapers any part of the world has ever seen. There is no satisfaction that can compare to this essential fact, nor any disappointment that can diminish its luster. Prognosis was, for nearly four full years, the exact sum of what the editorial staff imagined a great newspaper should be.”
And now it was over. Along with those defiant superlatives, Welch’s essay dished out an equal helping of self-pity. The other founders of the paper had postponed promising careers to embark on this adventure with him; “I, as a college dropout with little experience at anything, had nothing except an exaggerated sense of self-worth,” he wrote. “I am acutely aware that my life, such as it is right now, exists because of this newspaper and this experience called Prognosis. … Fact is, I now have something akin to a viable life, and the tangible source of that life is now dead.”
Prague was no longer the dreamy, mystical city Welch and his friends had discovered in 1990 as it emerged from the Cold War. The looseness of those post-Velvet Revolution days was fading, and the city was completing its transition from Soviet bloc outpost to Western destination. The Czechs were cashing in, hustlers now outnumbered hipsters, and the market was swallowing those, like Prognosis, who didn’t cut it.
Back home in the United States, Ken Layne, a former Prognosis writer, read Welch’s farewell column. The piece, he told me in 1995, “just shows Welch playing his favourite role: the bumbling can’t-get-my-shit-together-but-I-mean-well loser. … He refuses to take real responsibility for stuff falling apart. Prognosis failed because the founders had no interest or experience in running a successful business—and that’s what a newspaper is: a business. They thought business was bad and success was evil.”
ACROSS THE TABLE at U Vejvodů, Doug Arellanes, a former art director at the paper, pulled out an old letter. In 1990 Welch and two other founders — campus paper colleagues from the University of California at Santa Barbara — wrote to Arellanes from Prague. They shared the excitement of an idea: to launch an English-language newspaper in the Czech capital. “The key to all this I think is tapping as many good people as we can,” Christopher Scheer wrote in that letter, “not running this like a business but like a movement.” He would later explain: “No one starts a business with basically no money. We did. Lacking money, we damn well better have some love and elbow grease to carry us through. We were somewhat fatalistic, also, realizing that any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success.”
Welch had arrived in Eastern Europe that August to write a novel. When the other Americans who made up the future core of Prognosis pulled into Prague at the end of disparate backpacking trips, he was away in pre-war Yugoslavia; his pals discovered he had already established a profile. “He made quite an impression on this town,” Scheer wrote to Arellanes. “Women strewn in his wake, fans rumour-mongering about his eternally imminent return … It’s like Jesus!”
Anyone who met Matt Welch understood why. His long, blond hair, piercing dark eyes and affable demeanour often made him the center of attention. In Prague, he took to playing guitar for passers-by and spare change on the city’s postcard-perfect 700-year-old Charles Bridge. Back home in California, he had worked alongside the other Prognosis founders at the Daily Nexus, the University of California at Santa Barbara student paper, composing its weather forecasts as beat poetry. “He drank enormously, liked to wear dresses to work once a week and otherwise tried to create a mythos about himself,” Scheer would remember.
There was no shortage of talent among the founders of Prognosis, but Welch seemed to be the catalyst. He was “incredibly skilled at assembling myriad people to make his daydreams come to life,” according to Ken Layne. “I once told Matt the reason he’d never finish [writing] a book of fiction is because he’s too goddamn busy living a book of fiction.” If his life was, as he told it, going nowhere until he reached Prague, then the city offered the ideal setting for his apotheosis.
BESIDES THE STUNNING architecture, a rich cultural tradition, and women with beautiful Slavic eyes, Prague had Václav Havel. Czechoslovakia’s president knew about rising from despair to an exalted position. Havel, a playwright, had been jailed as a dissident by the Communists before the Velvet Revolution of November 1989 transformed him into head of state. He remained an idealist who talked of “living in truth” and building a civic society; for young Americans disenchanted with the Republicanism of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Havel added to Prague’s appeal. “My God, this is what politics should be,” John Allison, an early expat arrival, would remember thinking after seeing Havel’s February 1990 speech to the U.S. Congress. “This is my calling.” By the end of the year, Allison found himself working as the “American advisor” to Prague’s mayor.
Havel “did sort of underline the uniqueness of the place and time,” Christopher Scheer remembered. “He sort of encapsulated it. But he wasn’t the whole story, just a symptom, because every Czech we met seemed to have a wild story, to be oddly humble and intellectual at the same time. That’s why Havel could be president—because he represented a powerful strain in Czech culture.”
Welch came to idolize this rumpled philosopher-king who, indirectly, had made Prognosis possible. In his cramped apartment in an industrial section of Prague, a large poster of Havel occupied a place of honour on one wall. Someone had used a cigarette to burn out the eyes on another poster, of Václav Klaus, Czechoslovakia’s Thatcherite finance minister. You can deface anything on the walls, Welch once told a group of guests, except the Havel poster.
Besides Welch and Scheer, the other Americans who gathered at a pub in Prague in November 1990 to hash out the newspaper idea were Ben Sullivan, Laura Pitter, Jenny Ogar, and Lisa Frankenberg. They were all staying with Czech students Welch had befriended. “The next morning, we woke up hungover and had to decide if it was all just a beery fantasy,” Scheer recalled. “We decided tentatively that it wasn’t.”
The next evening, sober, they sat down and figured out how much money they could pool for the launch. Travellers’ cheques, credit card advances and anything they could sell were all put on the table. Everyone anted up except Lisa Frankenberg.
IN WELCH’S PROGNOSIS narrative, Lisa Frankenberg became the villain. Even in those early days, Scheer and others had doubts about Frankenberg, who had worked at the Nexus before leaving to get involved in the UCSB student government. Her unwillingness to put up money made them question her commitment to their Prague newspaper, but Welch, a friend, defended her. “She was not at all like our vibe,” Welch says. “We were pretty hippie and idealistic and journalism-based and easy to get along with. She was considerably more abrasive.” But he argued that “we need different types of personalities here, particularly on the business side, and maybe we can convert those negative characteristics into something we need.”
Today, the first few issues of the monthly Prognosis look amateurish, with unattractive fonts, awkward layout, and collegiate earnestness. But they were fresh and lively, and in the spring of 1991, with Prague’s expatriate population swelling, and thousands of English-speaking tourists on the way, they represented a triumph. The founders, their meager start-up funds supplemented with money from “investors” — a few well-heeled family friends back home — had waded through layers of left-over Communist bureaucracy just to launch the paper. The first edition, “zero issue,” was snapped up by expats and backpackers starved for something to read in English. The paper would go on to chronicle everything from the sweeping privatization of state institutions, to the growth of the drug trade and prostitution, to the establishment of an Andy Warhol Museum in the Slovak village where the artist’s mother was born. “We wanted to create something that had never existed, in a place where it was impossible to imagine such a thing existing,” Welch says.
Frankenberg soon began to have doubts. In charge of distribution and advertising, she heard the same comments over and over when she tried to sell subscriptions and ad space to the growing foreign business community. Prognosis was fun, but her prospective clients wanted serious business news to help them understand this lucrative new market. They also wanted it fast: a monthly paper didn’t provide immediacy in a quickly changing economy. And the sometimes arch, collegiate tone of the paper turned them off.
In an interview in 1995, Frankenberg described how no one at Prognosis seemed concerned about what she was hearing. “The attitude was, ‘We’re having fun, we’re enjoying this, why should we change?’” she told me. There was no business plan for growth, and no budget forecasting revenues and expenses. “Very clearly, the response [from the others] was, ‘We’re not a business, we’re a newspaper.’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute, a newspaper is a business.’”
Frankenberg’s worries were compounded the day Alan Levy visited the Prognosis office to offer his services. Levy, a 59-year-old American journalist, had covered the Prague Spring, Alexander Dubček’s 1968 attempt to democratize Communism from within. When Soviet tanks arrived to crush Dubček’s experiment, Levy was expelled. He lived in Vienna for 21 years, moving back shortly after the Velvet Revolution, and his book about 1968, So Many Heroes, became a must-read for expats. He proposed writing a column for Prognosis, a series of profiles of interesting Czechs and expatriates.
The founders turned him down. “We didn’t want to publish an archetypal expat-freelancer just because he had ‘clips,’” Welch later wrote. “I wasn’t at that fateful meeting, but apparently he came on strong and condescending, and I’m sure we were more than just a little defensive about people questioning our credentials and telling us what we should cover. So with those prejudices, we read his stuff and thought it wouldn’t fit into our Mission-from-God approach.”
Welch came to see it as a defining moment for the young paper: “We finally had confidence enough in what we were to reject an over-qualified representative of what we didn’t want to be,” Welch said. Frankenberg would later call her Prognosis colleagues “callow” for not hiring Levy. “I was flabbergasted that anyone would turn away such a gifted writer and I expressed my apologies to Alan,” she wrote years later. Frankenberg was now so frustrated that she considered packing it in and resuming her studies back in the States in the fall.
But in July 1991, a newspaper distributor working for Frankenberg had a chance meeting with a Texas businessman, Monroe Luther, who was in Prague inking deals. Luther told Frankenberg he might invest in Prognosis, but he wanted his money put to good use: he wanted a more business-oriented weekly, and suggested she come back with him in two days with a proposal to transform the paper.
According to Matt Welch and Christopher Scheer, Frankenberg and her philosophical soulmate in the Prognosis business office, Kent Hawryluk, demanded a radical change of editorial direction—more serious and business-friendly—without mentioning Luther’s possible infusion of cash. (Frankenberg disputed this account when I interviewed her in 1995, saying she was upfront about Luther’s investment offer and that the desire for a revamp came from him.) Frankenberg and Hawryluk also wanted to be equal partners in the business, a status denied to them because they had invested no money. Otherwise, they said, they’d walk. “Man, were we agonized,” Welch says. “We definitely needed them, and they did stuff we couldn’t imagine doing ourselves, but there was something pretty gross and not trustworthy about playing ultimatum games with an idealistic venture started by people of good faith. So ultimately, we said no.”
A few days later, Frankenberg and Hawryluk resigned from Prognosis and persuaded Luther to use his money to help them launch a business-oriented weekly called The Prague Post. It hit the streets in October, 1991, its early issues were hopelessly dull in design, style and content. But the paper knew how to sell itself: the Post played to the business community with credulous coverage of finance and investment, and bought prime space on billboards, branding itself a serious player in the marketplace and selling a lot of advertising. “Their initial billboards cost more than we spent in the first nine months of our entire operation,” Scheer recalled.
Alan Levy was hired as titular editor-in-chief of The Prague Post. “We are living in the Left Bank of the ’90s,” he declared in a column in the inaugural issue, alluding to Hemingway’s Paris. “For some of us, Prague is Second Chance City; for others a new frontier where anything goes, everything goes, and, often enough, nothing works. Yesterday is long gone, today is nebulous, and who knows about tomorrow, but, somewhere within each of us, we all know that we are living in a historic place at a historic time.”
The Prognosis founders were hardly jealous of the Post’s content—they rolled their eyes at Levy’s prose, and they wouldn’t miss Frankenberg and Hawryluk—but the pair took their advertising and distribution contacts with them. Suddenly, Prognosis was without a business staff, and without the network the pair had assembled to sell the newspaper in an often-baffling post-Communist environment. “It was like a jackhammer in the nuts,” Welch says. “It totally drained the joy out of the situation.”
Welch, Scheer, and the others responded by taking Prognosis biweekly and working even harder. “We did not, however, try to beat the Post at their own game,” Scheer said. “Arrogant or not, we decided very consciously to keep trying to put out the newspaper that we wanted to put out and not just try to be a local version of The Wall Street Journal.”
THEY STILL HAD HYPE on their side. For foreign reporters dropping in on Prague to profile the growing expat community, the grimy, cluttered Prognosis office was an essential stop. The paper represented the kind of journalism they secretly wanted to practice: fun, smart, brashly principled. Any feature piece on the self-exiled, twentysomethings of Prague inevitably included the same tropes: the American-owned New York Pizza restaurant; the mayor’s “American advisor,” John Allison, who had moved onto a job in Havel’s office in the majestic Castle overlooking the city; Laundry Kings, the American-owned, first-ever self-serve laundromat in Prague—and Prognosis. “It’s practically impossible to live here for any length of time and not be interviewed by some major paper or broadcast network, adding another level of absurdity to what is already a pretty ridiculous existence,” Welch would write. “All this silliness has not exactly hurt our paper, my career or my swelling ego needs.”
In July 1992 Welch was the central character in a lengthy article in Details magazine that many expats credited with single-handedly spinning the Prague hype-meter into the stratosphere. Using Prognosis as a framing device, writer Henry Copeland portrayed Prague as a hedonistic haven for a new lost generation. Welch and others would mock the article, particularly a quotation uttered by one Prognosis writer: “In Prague, everything is so open that you can re-invent yourself every day.” Yet a copy of that issue, preserved like new, was tucked away in Welch’s flat, where I discovered it during the two months I spent subletting his place.
In retrospect, that Details piece represented the high-water mark for expatriate Prague. The same summer it was published, reality began to intrude on the fairy tale: Czechoslovakia’s first full-scale elections, in June 1992 produced a political schism in the federation. Václav Klaus, leader of the Civic Democratic Party, triumphed in the Czech parliament, while the victory of a pro-independence party in Slovakia threatened to split the country. Klaus, a bottom-line man in favour of rapid privatization and economic restructuring, had no qualms about saying goodbye to the Slovaks: the poorer, slower-to-modernize, more rural part of the federation was a drag on his ideological plans. As president, Václav Havel sought to preserve the federation because of the multi-ethnic ideal it represented, but even Havel’s moral authority could not contain the forces that had been unleashed. On New Year’s Day, 1993, Czechoslovakia, the country that had survived Nazism and Communism, the two great totalitarian plagues of the twentieth century, ceased to exist.
Havel was soon chosen as president of the new Czech Republic and Klaus became its prime minister. Prognosis would call them “those wild and warring poster boys of the modern Czech soul.” Klaus, the no-nonsense, get-things-done manager in a hurry to downsize the machinery of government, was the efficient administrator, while Havel, the philosopher and moralist, was perfect for the role of symbolic head of state. They would clash repeatedly: Havel felt Klaus forgot the human element in governing; Klaus found Havel’s dreamy idealism impractical. “The advocate of non-political politics met a consummate political animal,” Havel’s biographer later wrote.
The schism echoed Prague’s expat newspaper war: Prognosis, though struggling financially, continued to strive for a journalistic ideal akin to Havel’s “living in truth” as it chronicled the changes in Czech society. The Post, Klaus-like in its pragmatism, prospered by playing to the market, giving the big-spending expat business community what it wanted. Prognosis was still cooler, but like Havel, it was no longer invincible.
THE DETAILS STORY drew me to Prague as I fled a recession-wracked newspaper industry in Canada. But by the time I arrived in January 1993, the city was re-inventing itself so quickly that it was no longer the Capital of Dreams sketched by the magazine just six months earlier. The cost of two expat staples, beer and apartment rent, both ridiculously cheap by U.S. standards in early 1992, were creeping up as the market adjusted to the city’s destination status. The talk now was less about Havel, the playwright president, and more about Klaus, the economic guru whose reforms were seen as a textbook example of how to move from Communism to capitalism.
Visiting reporters had also discovered a new source of expat wisdom. They now often visited the offices of The Prague Post to interview Lisa Frankenberg. Across town at Prognosis, meanwhile, the founders, exhausted by the grind of publishing and the battle with the Post, turned over senior editorial positions to newcomers and moved into writing positions, or onto new adventures. Welch relocated to Bratislava, the capital of newly independent Slovakia, to run the paper’s bureau there, while the new managers grappled with how to give the operation some much-needed stability.
The new publisher, Erica Breth, discovered there was still no real budget, business plan, or bookkeeping. (Scheer, when I interviewed him in 1995, disputed the idea that the founders had ignored the business side; they “worried enormously” about it, he said, but “none of it made our business sense any more acute, none of it made us more organized, none of it brought us big investors.”) More money from “investors” back in the U.S., including wealthy liberal philanthropist Helen Bing, couldn’t erase the red ink. The journalism remained solid, and Breth and her fellow managers stayed one step ahead of invoices from printers, phone companies and other suppliers. But Prognosis was sputtering financially.
Several staff members left in the summer and fall of 1993. Some, like me, were lured by jobs back home; most feared the paper’s demise was a matter of time. On a fundraising trip to the United States, Breth made the rounds of foundations and other do-gooders who had endowed the paper in the early days. But the Czech Republic’s much-publicized economic success meant, perversely, that the novelty of a scrappy little paper in Prague was wearing off. The money Breth gathered in early 1994 was quickly used, all at once, to pay off the paper’s printers, who hadn’t collected for months and were refusing to roll the presses.
Matt Welch wouldn’t give in. He left the bureau in Bratislava and returned to Prague, where he and Ben Sullivan, another founder, stepped back into senior editorial jobs under John Allison, who became editor-in-chief. “I still recall that the engine that was the news desk was being fueled almost single-handedly by Matt and John Allison, who both toiled mightily to put out a newspaper,” reporter Logan Mabe would say.
Welch was still making myths: Prognosis could rise again. In May, 1994, a Dutch businessman, Harmen Smink, injected cash by buying 51 per cent of the paper. Welch contacted a handful of Prognosis alumni in California, among them Ken Layne, and appealed to them to return to Prague. “He had these various godlike attributes attached to each of us,” Layne told me in 1995, “and he figured he could just play God and assemble a new group of ‘founders’ that would continue the legacy, as it were, and maybe put some fire and guts back into it.” Others were wary, but Layne accepted an offer to become editor-in-chief—until he learned at the last minute that he would not have the authority Welch had promised him. He was tempted, he said, to fly to Prague “just to beat the shit out of Matt and leave him for dead with his fucking guitar rammed up his hippy ass.” In Layne’s place, Charlie Hornberger, a Nexus pal of Welch, took over.
Smink’s money allowed Prognosis to move into better offices and go weekly with full-colour covers. Newsstand sales jumped, but advertising did not. Within a few weeks the problems began anew: Smink’s hard currency seemed to be evaporating. It would later emerge that the paper’s business manager was defrauding the paper, funneling money into her own private ventures. By the time anyone noticed, it was too late.
The newspaper’s philosophical guru up in Prague Castle was in no better state. As his popularity plummeted, Václav Havel mused to one interviewer about how he looked forward to leaving the presidency and becoming a simple pensioner. The economy, not ethics and morals, drove the agenda in Prague, and Prime Minister Václav Klaus was the man of the moment. He had a budget surplus forecast for 1995, the lowest inflation rate in the former Soviet bloc, and a jobless rate below four per cent. At the end of 1994, Klaus mocked Havel’s idea of the president delivering a “State of the Nation” address to Parliament — then delivered one himself. Poll after poll showed Czechs considered Havel the more principled of the two men, but they trusted Klaus to run the country.
On New Years’ Day, 1995, Klaus gave a look-ahead interview to the country’s first private TV station, Nova. In a clear attempt to eclipse the president, it was broadcast at the same time as Havel’s New Year’s address on state television. Of Havel’s remarks, Prognosis reported: “Far from an optimist in his days of waning popularity and influence, Havel could apparently muster only the dark conclusion that ‘Not everything is lost yet.’”
The president might as well have been talking about the expat newspaper inspired by his idealism. As the financial situation worsened, Welch accepted a job at the Budapest Business Journal. Smink tried to buy out the remaining 49 per cent of the paper still owned by Welch and the founders; when they balked, he cut off salaries and shopped his controlling shares to potential buyers, including The Prague Post. A gossip column in the February 21 issue of Prognosis ended prophetically with a comment that “all things come to an end sometime.” The following week, the founders decided to maintain their paper’s dignity. They closed it down.
MATT WELCH SAT down with a bottle of wine at his desk in Budapest at the end of February 1995 and wrote a piece for the final issue of Prognosis that would be headlined “A Long Goodbye to the Paper I Loved Best.”
“We were right all along,” Welch wrote, “if excessively stupid and self-indulgent in the deployment.” He expressed pride in the legacy Prognosis would leave—in particular the journalism education it gave to many young Czechs and Slovak interpreters and translators who became talented reporters for local media organizations—but he also mourned: this was the piece in which he declared that “the tangible source of [his] life is now dead,” tying his own fate to that of the daydream he would soon bury. “What I was expressing there,” he says now, “was a kind of gratitude for having been able to experience something that made me at least quasi-presentable to the world of journalism, and a melancholy for that beautiful and helpful thing being dead.”
Lisa Frankenberg told me she felt no sense of triumph at the demise of Prognosis, even though it gave her Prague Post a freer hand in Prague’s English-language media market. She claimed to be moved by Welch’s coda. “There were probably only a handful of people who read that through to the end. I read it. I read it to the very end,” she said. Winning the expat newspaper war was “very weird and sad. It was a very weird day. We knew it was coming for a long time.”
One night in May 1995, as the spring air brought with it the promise of another beautiful summer in Prague, Frankenberg took a stroll on the Charles Bridge with Monroe Luther, the owner of the Post. They talked about the paper’s prospects: its circulation was rising, and a growing number of English-speaking Czechs read it. “It’s a successful business,” Frankenberg told me at the time, though she refused to reveal if it was profitable.
Suddenly Frankenberg saw a familiar figure with a guitar, blond hair waving in the breeze as he strummed on the bridge. “Hey, Matt!” she yelled. He smiled, answered, “Hey, Frankenberg.” Matt Welch was back in town, and could still muster a smile for his former rival.
Frankenberg and Luther kept walking. “Someday in the future, I’d like to sit down with him and have a coffee or a beer and talk things out,” she told me in 1995. “But it takes time. It was probably like part of him dying when Prognosis died.”
They never had that coffee. Welch eventually returned to the United States, where, he says, he parlayed what he called the “quasi-presentable” reputation he earned in Prague into a career in journalism. The Prague Post continues to publish digitally, though it shed its print edition in 2013. Welch says he holds no grudge against Frankenberg. “Why? Competition’s good, man! It made both papers better. And because I, unlike her, can look at myself in the mirror every night before going to sleep without so much as a twinge of doubt of how I comported myself professionally in my early twenties. She won the battle, for which she deserves real credit. But history will not remember her paper nearly the same way, and that just makes me smile and smile.”
IN 1995, MANY Prognosis staffers and alumni were less sanguine. True, the city had become faster, harder, more expensive and less forgiving: the free market that had made Prognosis possible had killed it. But it was tempting to conclude Welch and the others had squandered what they had built—a newspaper that everyone who worked there had come to consider their own.
“These American kids start the first English-language newspaper. … It can’t help but thrive, right?” Welch’s friend, Ken Layne, told me in an e-mail in 1995. “It sputters along for several years, getting a million dollars in free press, no business plan, no financial plan, no discipline, just bumbling along, just like all of Prague is doing. And just like the fucking Communists, Prognosis is living off subsidies,” a reference to the money from relatives and foundations in the United States. “Meanwhile, the Czechs figure it all out. They toss away a lifetime of anti-capitalist bullshit and turn Prague into a fucking money machine. Everybody figures out how to run a business, how to make cash, how to succeed — everybody but these American kids who refuse to even acknowledge the need for money, for success.
“If Lisa Frankenberg is your villain,” Layne added, “you’ve bought into the biggest piece of fabricated history ever. If they had figured out how to use Lisa’s smarts … Prognosis would be a thriving media empire today instead of a dead newspaper fondly remembered by fifty people. The results speak for themselves. Lisa is no monster. A hundred other people have felt the same way about the half-ass manner in which Prognosis was run.”
When I remind Layne of those comments almost two decades later, he explains that “one of my habits of my youth was to get good and drunk and pissed off while typing. It was, I guess, my literary style of the era.” In 1995, he says, he was still bitter about his aborted return to Prague. “I was supposed to be editor of a paper I loved in the Czech Republic, and instead I was drifting around.”
Layne still doesn’t blame Frankenberg for the paper’s demise: she left in 1991, and the paper took another four years to fold, he points out, plenty of time to have turned things around. But he is more forgiving of Welch and company. “While I’ve lost touch with all but a dozen or so of the Prognosis gang, those dozen people remain some of my best friends,” he says. “The group of Californians and Czechs who started up that paper did a pretty good job with intolerable circumstances.” Even in 1995, at his most frustrated, Layne said of them, “they are good people, and that Prague experience remains incredibly significant. It reverberates through every part of my life.”
CHRISTOPHER SCHEER’S FATHER, journalist Robert Scheer, urged the Prognosis founders in 1994 “to just become an Internet newspaper,” Welch says, “which would have been way ahead of the curve.” Instead, because the paper died at almost the precise moment the Internet became a mass phenomenon, there is no online archive or digital database of its five-year run. Former employees now speak of a complete set of printed issues the way one recounts an urban legend: the full run is always sitting in the basement of the friend of a friend, just out of reach. So Prognosis, as an iteration of young, earnest, idealistic journalism, cannot be considered in its entirety, but only in pieces. A virtual collection of yellowed issues lies scattered across the globe, a notional scrapbook of clippings, impressions, half-memories and fading photographs.
In the twenty years since its demise, my picture of Prognosis has evolved from a lost opportunity into something else. As a bit player, I too was frustrated to see it fold. Today, I no longer imagine an alternate history in which Prognosis survived the nineties: I just marvel at the audacity of its brief, improbable existence. During one gloomy period in 1993, Christopher Scheer wrote in a memo to the staff that the paper was not “a normal institution. … Stability is not its primary, overriding goal. Those who seem to wish Prognosis was some great gleaming ship of stable corporate love — including myself at many an exhausted moment — would not want to work at such a place.” The founders of Prognosis gave us a life-changing experience; they didn’t owe us permanence.
Any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success, Scheer had said. And so the sharp edges of the picture soften to something else: a moment, ephemeral but real, in the dusty swirl of post-1989 Central Europe. Lyle Zimskind, a managing editor of the Czech edition of Esquire, would remember Prognosis as “chaotically managed” but “livelier” than the Post — a victory by any measure, except that of for-profit survival.
In his 1990 letter, Scheer had advocated “not running this like a business but like a movement.” And every movement runs its course. Welch made not only his daydreams come to life, but those of every other expat who saw their work — their words, their whimsy, their passion — on those pages. “Prognosis was an expression of pure newspaper romanticism,” he says. “The whole thing was an expression of love for the form.”
“The paper failed,” writer Logan Mabe would conclude, “but it wasn’t a failure.”
IN LATE 2011, Welch, now the editor-in-chief of Reason, a Washington libertarian magazine, returned to Prague to attend the funeral of his idol, Václav Havel. Havel’s English translator, Paul Wilson, had secured him a seat inside St. Vitus Cathedral, the imposing Gothic structure at Prague Castle that dominates the city skyline.
Outside the gates, hundreds of thousands normally taciturn Czechs were mourning their hero. They were part of the West now, part of the European Union and of NATO, and though Havel’s popularity had faded before he left the presidency in 2003, his reputation for principle was intact — unlike that of his rival, Klaus, whose government was eventually tainted by corruption scandals. And so, though the end of Communism had produced many complications and disappointments, the citizens of Prague crowded the streets for Havel’s funeral procession, wrapping the city in the same atmosphere of possibility they created in 1989.
In a piece for Reason’s website, Welch reflected on what Havel had inspired, not in Welch himself, but in the Czech capital. “From the Velvet Revolution through at least 1991, and in many (though lesser) respects for years after, Prague was alive with rediscovery and experimentation in the exciting, difficult, anarchic interlude between Communism and its built-out replacement,” he wrote. “More than mere nostalgia for a limited era of time (one I was fortunate enough to participate in), that same spirit of, well, love, or at least its handmaiden decency, has never really gone away.”
The newspaper was never far from Welch’s mind during his quick return to Prague. “That forty-eight hours I spent there was a profound moment, one I absolutely lived up to by drinking until 5 a.m. the night before the funeral with a bunch of ex-Prognosis comrades, and then vomiting inside the castle after the religious ceremony, and also, again, under the Charles Bridge on the walk back,” he told me. “Friends from New York told me to do it right, in their honor, and so I did.”
“Prague is beautiful like an insecure woman,” Prognosis staffer Kate Sullivan once wrote. “It doesn’t seem to realize the crazy extent of its beauty; it doesn’t notice the effect it has on people.” But everyone who ever worked at the paper realized it. They still do.
“To this day,” Welch says, “I reject the term ‘the real world,’ because my feeling is that we should all strive for the surrealism that we were able to enjoy in early-nineties Prague.”

Our experiences traveling through Prague
Prague is the complete opposite of Berlin. While Berlin is modern and hip, Prague still maintains its old town charms and traditional values. At first glance, Prague appears to be frozen in time thanks to its beautiful old buildings, castles and town squares that have survived the past few world wars.
However, after delving deeper into the city we soon realised that the entire Old Town and Castle Quarter were populated by tourists. Most locals in these areas were people working in the tourism industry and shop retailers. I have mixed feelings about Prague. I may be slightly biased by the fact that we both fell ill for two whole days in Prague, but mostly I think it’s because unlike Berlin, we didn't really get to experience a lot (if any) of the local scenes in Prague.
CONS:
PROS:
Having visited 4 countries already as I write this, Prague stands out as the most distinct and beautiful old city. The Old Town (Stare Mesto)is the centerpiece of Prague, intact with beautiful heritage buildings exudes an air of romance at nightfall when the orange hued street lamps lights up the streets of Old Town. Walking around Old Town Square in the evening felt abit like being in a fairytale.
Also for the opera and theatre fans, the tickets to a show were very reasonable (approx 10–15euros) compared to Vienna. We didn’t manage to catch a show, however reading online it would appear that Prague offers a good and cheaper alternative for classical music plays.
Castle Quarter (Hradcany) is a Unesco heritage site known for Prague Castle located in this area and the surrounding sights which are packed with Czech history. Castle Quarter dominates the skyline of Prague as it is located on a hill on the other side of River Vltava. Aside from the multitude of historical museums, cathedral and castle buildings to visit, Castle Quarter also offers the best vantage point for photography. Get yourself a combi ticket at Prague Castle to get the most out of your visit. Some of the notable mentions were captured in the photos below.
Unfortunately our appetites have shrunk in Prague. As mentioned earlier, we fell sick and were homebound for two whole days out of our week long duration in Prague. That could be the cause of our lack of foodie finds, but generally Prague didn’t impress us much in the food aspect. The foodie scene was not as evolved as its neighbouring cities, so fusion or international cuisines were not as plentiful. Their traditional meals are generally meat and potatoes with not much greens on the plate. I’m all for trying new food and traditional cuisines, but I can now conclude that Prague’s traditional fares are just not for me.

A few weeks ago, I visited Prague and stayed there for five nights. It was my third visit to this capital city. This time, I came to this magnificent place not as a tourist but as a job seeker. Of course, as a non-Czech-speaking social scientist, it was indeed unrealistic and naive to think that I could land something here. The expected delusion and frustration tainted my views on the things surrounding me; all the people (especially the tourist gangs) appeared so annoying that I was unable to enjoy my stay.
With that being said, I still walked around and tried to catch up with some good old friends. Of course, the one and only Charles Bridge was a “must-revisit.”
I also revisited the “ugly corner” of Prague that I had my first encounter with during the early outbreak of the pandemic. I use quotation marks here because it can be a precious gem if you are into alternative urban landscapes. Anyway, I did not intend to see it again. But the apartment of the couchsurfing host, who accommodated me for the first three nights, was just a dozen meters away. It indeed reminded me of the days when people were annoyed by the unknown virus.

My brother and I decided to establish the headquarters of our tech company in Prague. It was the best decision we’ve ever made.
People who have visited Prague before can confirm that it’s an astonishing city with impressively clean streets, stunning architecture, diverse cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife. But most people are only now starting to realize that Prague is also a hidden gem for tech companies.
To understand why Prague is just starting to flourish, you have to look back more than 100 years and understand a bit of Czech history.
Throughout its history, the Czech Republic has always been a prominent economic player in Europe. In the early 20th century, it was actually an industrial powerhouse and held 10th place in the world industrial production. It was only after World War 2 when the Czech Republic became occupied by the Soviet Union and then ruled by communism, that its economy started to halter.
However, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully ended communism, the Czech Republic reestablished democracy and a market economy. Since then (over the last 30 years) the Czech economy has been growing at an impressive pace and it now proudly produces the most GDP per capita in comparison to all other post-communist countries.
Prague also has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, at just 1.3%.
Looking back at the last 30 years and seeing how much progress the Czech Republic has made leaves me and everybody living in Prague excited about the future.
The Czech Republic boasts a great education system.
I myself spent a few years in the Czech Republic during high school and can confirm it from first-hand experiences. When I was transferring over from my school in the US, I had to spend the whole summer catching up on algebra, physics, and chemistry just so that I could join the same age students and didn’t have to stay a year back.
Getting a university education in the Czech Republic is free, which gives the opportunity for everyone to enroll and lifts the education level across the whole population. The free education system also attracts many foreign students who wouldn’t have been able to afford an education at home.
Czech universities also have very high-quality computer science and mathematics programs, which serves as a solid foundation for future software engineers. The mathematics programs are especially key for those students who later on pursue careers in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
HackerRank, a California-based service that runs tests for software engineers, ranked Czech engineers 2nd in the world in mathematical challenges which reflect their skill in functional programming.
The Czech engineers ranked 9th in the world overall. The US ranked 13th.
If you’re reading this article and you’re sitting in a large US metropolitan area, you’re probably used to long commute times and have just accepted traffic as part of your life, as I did when I was living in the Bay Area. Prague doesn’t have this issue.
Its public transport system is ranked 5th in the world and is used by over two thirds of the city’s population. It has an affordable, yet sophisticated train, metro, tram and bus system, allowing you to comfortably get around the city within minutes.
Prague is located in the heart of Europe and has direct flight connections to all other major European cities such as Paris, London, or Amsterdam. Flight times are all under 2h and usually cost between $50 — $250 round trip.
Prague is gradually becoming a global metropolis and is catching up to cities like Paris and Amsterdam, however, it is still incomparable when it comes to prices and is, therefore, a great place to work and live. You can afford to live a high standard of life with an average Prague salary, especially if you’re working in tech.
I ran a price comparison of San Francisco vs. Prague (my two hometowns) and this is where we’ve landed (1):
It’s also tough to get bored in Prague. It’s an energetic city with endless cool events to attend. If you’re into contemporary art exhibits, prosecco festivals, local food markets, underground techno raves, or just into chilling in the park enjoying the castle view, you’ve got it.
Over recent years, Prague has attracted a lot of foreigners and now has a thriving expat community, which makes up more than 25% of Prague’s workforce. Plenty of Americans and Brits have decided to move here as well and surprisingly in some districts you now hear English on the streets and at cafes more often than Czech.
We’re witnessing the Prague startup scene flourish.
Just over the past few months, we’ve seen Prague startup productboard raise a $45,000,000 Series B round led by Sequoia Capital, Twisto, an emerging fintech startup raise $15,000,000 and Rossum, a startup extracting data from invoices and documents using machine learning, raise $4,500,000.
If you’re just launching your tech startup and are having trouble with hiring the right technical talent, or are shocked by the high prices and burn rate you’ll have in an oversaturated tech hub like Silicon Valley, you might want to consider making Prague your new home.
Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I’ll be happy to give you tips and tricks for Prague. I’ve been here for almost 4 years and moving here was the best decision I’ve made.

Southeast Asia is so much popular and we can read about those ideal places for nomadic lifestyle in almost every second interview with some digital nomad. It has been many years like that but today more digital nomads are tired of Asia and want to try something else.
Why not?
Location independent lifestyle is not about living in Asia.
I know, South East Asia is perfect. It is so cheap! It is fun! There are beaches! You will escape from stress…
It might be true, but why should I stay there for the rest of my life? Yeah, let's go there, experience that, but why settle there?
Digital nomads can work from anywhere, so they tend to move every month or two months. Their “moving out/in factor” is very deep inside of them.
For those who are from Australia or New Zeland it is obvious that they prefer Indonesia, Malaysia or South East Asia. But what about US citizens? Coming to Europe is not hard for them. They ask for a Shengen visa and can travel within all EU members during the period of 3 months.
Many of them know right now and the word of mouth is getting spread out.
This is just a beginning. Let's dig deeper why you will meet more digital nomads in Prague nowadays than ever before. Prague is indeed becoming one of the most popular hub for digital nomads.
The climate in the Czech Republic is very nice for all three season (spring, summer, autumn). Of course most digital nomads are coming during summer. Winter is not a favourite season while you are in the city. Anyway the location of Prague can guarantee very pleasant weather conditions.
Moreover there are no earthquakes or any other dangerous nature occasions.
Prague's architecture is amazing. Many says that Prague is the heart of Europe and the most beautiful city in the whole Europe. And it is true! If you don't believe me, you should google some images from Prague.
The Czech Republic lies in the middle of Europe, you can decide if it is eastern or western Europe. Don't forget bring this topic when you sit with a beer with some Czech. You will have fun, that's for sure :-)
The infrastructure in Prague is very modern. The transportation is easy and as a english speaking traveller you won't have a bigger problems.
Yeah, we do speak english. It is not our official language, but most young people can speak very good english. You can meet lots of foreigners in Prague as well.
When you are lost, you simply ask for a direction in the nearest shop and will get an answer.
There are many coworking spaces in Prague. You can choose if you prefer bigger space or maybe smaller coworking.
The price is around 10 Euro/1 hour or 130 Euro/month.
I can recommend you Locus Coworking or Impact Hub.
Plenty of events are going on every day in Prague. Either business's topics or topics for self-improvement. The good thing about coworking spaces in Prague is that they are not just for work but they really connect you with other interesting people. The staff do lots of events, so make sure you will check them out.
You can find many cultural events in the city as well.
Prague is a place where to party, that is for sure. Prague is very famous because travellers go party here. Some come to Prague just to party. I am serious!
Well, if you come here, it is definitely recommended to experience that. The buzz is cheap and there are tons of clubs.
Work hard, party hard!

Last summer, when the spring lockdown temporarily lifted, we engaged in a bit of an ‘empty Prague tourism.’ It’s surprising how little I get to see the city’s historical parts — I mostly avoid them because they are full of tourists. Prague is wonderful (so I understand that people want to see it), and the distinctive landmarks like Charles Bridge or Old Town Square are usually packed. And so that’s where we decided to go.
We started our stroll at the beautiful Kampa island. With its maze of tiny streets and an old watermill, it’s one of my favorite places in Prague. We didn’t go as far as the famous Lennon wall, but we enjoyed the poetry booth on the edge of the park instead. This invention is one of the indigenous ideas of Ondrej Kobza, who is also behind the Prague street piano initiative and is always looking for ways to make the city more interesting. Needless to say, I am a fan.
From Kampa, we headed to the Charles Bridge. I was curious about how many people would be there — after all, we were not the only ones on the empty city sightseeing bandwagon. As it turned out, it wasn’t completely devoid of explorers like us, but there were very few people.
The Charles Bridge is usually a bustling hub of activity with its sides lined by various stalls and the space between them filled by a mass of people. You can move only at a slow pace here — together with the crowd. I have never seen it as empty as that day.
We crossed the Charles Bridge and got to the Old Town Square and its famous astronomical clock. When I was a little child, my parents sometimes took me there to see the renowned moving figurines of the twelves apostles, a display that plays out at the end of every hour. But we always had to stand on our tiptoes in the middle of the crowd to see them.
This time was different. We picked the restaurant directly across the astronomical clock, sat at an outside table, ordered lunch, and waited for the whole spectacle to begin.
I have never ever thought that I would be eating in one of the Old Town Square restaurants. Usually, they are full of tourists, and the prices are astronomical — no pun intended. Today though, the restaurant was half-empty and the prices reasonable. And the food was delicious too! I was glad to find out they served a vegetarian burger, and I can definitely recommend it. If you are interested, the name of the restaurant is El Toro Negro.
We slowly ate our lunch, and then the astronomical clock awakened, and everything suddenly set to motion. The twelve apostles moved behind the little windows, a figure of a skeleton that represents death beckoned at us with its little scythe, and the cockerel that symbolizes life ended the spectacle with its crowing. It was pretty nostalgic because I haven’t been here for a long time.
At the end of our excursion, we decided to visit the main Prague library around the corner from Old Town Square. We had a particular reason for it — in the lobby is a sculpture that I love, and Ben has never seen it before. It is a tower built from old books stretching from the floor to the ceiling. Inside of it are two mirrors that reflect the picture, so when you look inside, you see a book tunnel that stretches into eternity.
I never get tired of this sight. Ben was properly amazed. We are a pair of bookworms, so we can never pass on a sight like this. And it was a great conclusion to a well-spent day as tourists in our own city. It was a fun thing to do, and I think we will try to repeat it more often from now on, Covid or not. After all, Prague is a beautiful city, and I should realize more often how lucky I am to live here.

All by myself: Where to Get Coffee as an Introvert in Prague,https://medium.com/@katerynabasina/all-by-myself-where-to-get-coffee-as-an-introvert-in-prague-ce8fc26d205,"Sign up

It seems illogical that an introvert should love going out. And yet we do. However, we often go out for reasons contrary to why extrovert’s head to the nearest bar. It is not a journey to meet someone or get social, it is a time to engage in a solitary activity and dive into the inner world of thought, perceptions and sensations. Whenever an extrovert goes out to make a new acquaintance, an introvert will often prefer to read a book, do some writing or appreciate the multitude of tastes that his food offers him.
The Internet abounds in advice on how to dine like an introvert. Some of it is quite amusing, like:
While you may choose to follow or disregard this advice, I suggest you head to a cafe anyway. Here’s my list of cafes in Prague where you can have a decent cup of coffee and be left alone, if that’s what your heart desires.
Mama coffee
I found Mama coffee by chance. I wanted to have a look at a New Town Tower and followed the Vodičkova street heading to Vaclavske namesti. On my right I saw big steel-framed windows and cosy tables inside, so I gave it a chance. At the time I was starting to get desperate about finding decent coffee in Prague.
This place is more than simply good coffee in the city center (and believe me when I say finding good coffee is not as easy as it might seem). It has a great vibe due to the abundance of green plants, vintage furniture and photographs on the walls. It was there that my husband and I bought two framed photographs by František Beneš — a mysterious Czech photographer who voyaged across Europe and Africa and captured people and life at the turn of the century. Why is Beneš mysterious? His photo negatives have only recently been discovered and archived by another Czech photographer, Martin Wágner, but there is little information about Beneš himself.
It was in this caffee I saw a girl with Jack Russell and I had a thought that it was the very dog breed I needed. The Asian girl was sitting on a stool at a bar, slowly retracting dog biscuits from a pocket of her black jacket and feeding it to a dog who was watching her with lively and attentive eyes. The universe works in unique ways, and a day later we got Josef from a shelter, who is a mix of a Jack and a daschund, our misbehaving and beloved pup.
The café has solid desserts and very affordable house wines, so you can safely hide away in a corner with a book or with your work on a laptop.
Neustadt
Minus: they don’t serve coffee after 7 p.m. except for filtered coffee.
Plus: enchanting courtyard. If you are lucky enough you might even hear some music — there is a piano open for public to play. When the sounds fill up the courtyard, it is the most enchanting experience. The music will play its charm upon you.
Neustadt is a hipster place and rightly so. Just sit down and listen to how the voices of people around you echo from the walls of the courtyard. Look at the grapes on the adjacent wall and the little tower which will make you think a Rapunzel might actually feel quite comfortable here.
Literární kavárna Retêzova
If you find yourself in that very hellish part of town which is swarmed with tourists, you’ll crave to end up in a quiet place. Well, I’ve got you covered. Retezova street is in the very center but miraculously manages to stay crowd-free. The first time we came to Literarní kavarna was on our first visit to Prague. It was winter and in the middle of the day the place was empty. And so was it on all of my other visits. This is the perfect place to blog away, being inspired by all the black-and-white photographs of writers who used to frequent this place.
Mind you, despite the lack of people the service can be a bit slow — on the other hand, why hurry when you have all day to write that article?
Grand Café Orient
The very building in which Grand Cafe Orient is situated brings you back to an era of Czech cubism — all things pre-war, avant-garde, revolutionary and rebellious. I have never seen anything quite like it in design, and it is easy to see why Czech cubism is something the nation takes pride in — crystalline shapes and unexpected angles of ordinary objects. Its idea was to reject the secessionist architecture and yet if you look closely its aesthetic is as decorative as the style it rejected.
Paradoxically, Grand Cafe Orient on the second floor is less cubist, more art nouveau. The coffee is alright, this is definitely a place for people-watching, tourist-watching, to be precise. Yet the atmosphere lashes your imagination and it runs away like a wild steed into an era where rebelling with art was possible without the phones, but with the work full of expression.
Louvre
I didn’t want to include Louvre first because it defies my theory. At midday, it is definitely not a good place for introverts, because it’s packed with tourists. And even if you do get a place a stranger will most certainly come up and wish to sit with you. And if they sit down, they’ll most certainly engage into conversation with you. It happened to me on my last visit. An American lady, desperate for a lunch spot, sat down on the bench across from me, and as she was doing that already, I offered her to join me for lunch not to seem rude. We had a small talk about this and that — she was living in LA, came to Prague for a screenwriting and poetry workshop — don’t get me wrong, I love meeting artistic people, but it was not what I came to the cafe for. I came to dive into my own inner world, remember?
And yet I could not make a list of my favourite cafes and not include this one. There’s something absolutely tantalising in dining at the same table as Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Karel Čapek and Albert Einstein could have dined. They could have been writing letters, having philosophical readings or using these tables as a temporary office. That link to a different epoch amazes me and makes me fantasise: how different did life feel at that time? Did it feel less hectic? Cruel? Paced? More authentic? More like you owned it because there wasn’t any technology involved? Because you weren’t bombarded by all these little notifications and e-mails and messages that keep your mind in all other possible places but not actually in your life?
As you can see, it is a good place for meditation. As a bonus, this place has the only proper Turkish coffee in Prague, made and served in a proper little copper cezve. Mmm!
Cukrkavalimonada
Simply the best place in Mala Strana (the area of Prague on the other side of Charles Bridge). Especially good for salads, pasta and mouth-watering desserts. Because the tables are so close to each other, also very good for eavesdropping. Once I overheard a conversation between a woman — she was a teacher of Czech — and her date, apparently a “project manager”. I initially thought he was a spy, because he was carefully avoiding all talk about his work, giving vague answers like — “I am from US and work on some projects that have to do with Europe”. But in the end I thought may be he was just an asshole, trying to sound more important than he really was.
Anyway, if you love fresh food with an Italian twist — this place calls upon you. Be sure to bring a decent amount of cash though, as they don’t accept credit cards!
Do you enjoy visiting cafes by yourself? What does your favourite cafe look and feel like? I’d be very curious to know. And if you recommend another atmospherical cafe in Prague, i’ll be more than happy to check it out and include it in my list! Happy cafe-strolling!

Why is Prague so popular? It’s a question that often comes up, and one that is easily answered. With its stunning architecture, vibrant culture, and long history, Prague is one of Europe’s most popular tourist destinations. From its cobblestone streets to its iconic castles, there are many reasons why Prague is so beloved by visitors from around the world. In this blog post, we’ll explore what makes Prague so popular and why it remains a top destination for travelers.
Prague has a fascinating history that spans over a thousand years. Founded in the 9th century, Prague has been a significant political, cultural, and economic center in Europe since its inception. It was once the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and the seat of the Kings of Bohemia.
Throughout its history, Prague has witnessed a plethora of events, from invasions and wars to periods of peace and prosperity. One of the most significant events in the city’s history was the Prague Spring in 1968, a time of political and cultural liberalization, which ended in Soviet intervention.
Another defining moment in Prague’s history was the Velvet Revolution in 1989, which marked the end of communist rule in Czechoslovakia. The revolution was peaceful, and it brought about political and economic reforms that helped transform Prague into the vibrant and cosmopolitan city it is today.
Visitors to Prague can experience the city’s rich history through its many historical sites, such as Prague Castle, the Old Town Square, and the Jewish Quarter. These sites offer a glimpse into the city’s past and the significant events that shaped its history.
Prague is a city steeped in culture, from its rich history to its modern arts scene. The city has been influenced by various cultures throughout its history, including German, Jewish, and Slavic cultures. This has created a unique blend of traditions, art, music, and cuisine that draws in visitors from around the world.
One of the main draws of Prague’s culture is its art scene. The city is home to numerous art galleries and museums, such as the National Gallery and the Museum of Decorative Arts. Prague’s love for the arts can also be seen in its architecture, with numerous buildings boasting impressive designs and intricate details.
Prague is also famous for its traditional cuisine, which includes dishes like goulash, roast pork, and dumplings. Visitors can experience authentic Czech food at local restaurants or try it out for themselves by visiting the city’s farmers’ markets and food stalls.
Aside from its food and art, Prague is also known for its music scene. The city has produced many famous musicians, such as Antonin Dvorak, Bedrich Smetana, and Gustav Mahler. Prague is also home to numerous music festivals, including the Prague Spring International Music Festival, which attracts top musicians and visitors from around the world.
Overall, Prague’s culture is a vibrant and eclectic mix of history, art, music, and food that is truly one-of-a-kind. Visitors to this city will be able to immerse themselves in this unique culture and experience something truly unforgettable.
Prague’s stunning architecture is undoubtedly one of the key reasons why the city is such a popular tourist destination. Throughout the centuries, Prague has been shaped by many different architectural styles, each one contributing to the city’s unique character and charm.
One of the most famous styles of architecture in Prague is Gothic. This style can be seen in many of the city’s churches, including St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle. The cathedral is a breathtaking example of Gothic architecture, with its towering spires and intricate stone carvings.
Another notable style of architecture in Prague is Baroque. This style is known for its grandeur and extravagance, and can be seen in many of the city’s palaces and public buildings. The Clementinum, a complex of historic buildings in the Old Town, is a stunning example of Baroque architecture, with its ornate facades and sweeping staircases.
Of course, Prague Castle is the centrepiece of the city, so don’t miss this incredible building, even if you only have a few hours to spare. Get your Prague Castle skip the line tickets in advance to save even more time.
In addition to these historic styles, Prague also boasts a number of Art Nouveau buildings. This style is characterized by its decorative and ornamental elements, and can be seen in buildings such as the Municipal House, which was built in the early 20th century.
Prague’s architecture is not just limited to grand public buildings and churches. The city’s streets are lined with beautiful and colorful houses, many of which have intricate stonework and decorative details. The Old Town Square is a great example of this, with its colorful facades and charming cobblestone streets.
Hop on a Prague guided tour to experience the city’s best buildings.
Prague has a magical and romantic atmosphere that draws in visitors from all over the world. The cobblestone streets, gothic buildings, and romantic bridges all contribute to this city’s enchanting vibe. Prague’s atmosphere can best be experienced by wandering around the city’s streets, soaking up its ambiance.
The old town square, located in the heart of the city, is a particularly atmospheric spot. Visitors can admire the impressive buildings surrounding the square, take a break at a quaint café, and listen to the chimes of the Astronomical Clock. The Charles Bridge is another great place to experience Prague’s atmosphere. The bridge’s views of the Vltava River, the castle, and the city skyline are breathtaking, and the street musicians and artists that populate the bridge make it an exciting place to be.
One of the best things about Prague’s atmosphere is that it’s present day and night. In the daytime, the city’s vibrant energy and buzzing markets are a delight to explore. But at night, Prague transforms into an entirely different city. The streetlights illuminate the gothic buildings, casting shadows on the streets below. The atmosphere is quieter, more intimate, and altogether more romantic. A night-time walk along the Charles Bridge or a cozy dinner in a local restaurant are unforgettable experiences.
In short, Prague’s atmosphere is a mixture of history, romance, and a touch of the mysterious. The city’s magic is best experienced by wandering its streets and soaking up its ambiance. There is simply no other city quite like Prague.
Last but not least, the people of Prague contribute greatly to the city’s popularity as a tourist destination. Prague locals are known for their friendliness, warmth, and hospitality, making visitors feel welcomed and comfortable during their stay.
As one of the most culturally diverse cities in Europe, Prague attracts people from all walks of life, including expats, international students, and travelers from around the world. This vibrant mix of cultures and nationalities adds to the city’s appeal, making it a hub of diversity and creativity.
Moreover, the people of Prague are proud of their city’s heritage and are always eager to share their stories and traditions with visitors. Whether you’re exploring the historic streets or enjoying a night out at a local pub, you’re likely to meet locals who are passionate about their city and willing to show you around.
In addition, Prague is a safe city with low crime rates, which contributes to a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. Visitors can explore the city at their own pace and feel safe while doing so.
All in all, the people of Prague are a vital part of what makes this city so popular. Their friendliness, cultural diversity, and passion for their city create an unforgettable experience for visitors, making Prague a must-see destination in Europe.
Overall, Prague is a truly unique and special city, with a fascinating history, stunning architecture, rich culture, and a lively atmosphere that attracts visitors from all over the world. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply looking to experience a new culture, Prague has something for everyone.
The locals are friendly and welcoming, and the city offers an endless array of restaurants, cafes, and nightlife options. So, whether you’re here for a few days or a few weeks, there’s no doubt that Prague will leave a lasting impression on you and that it’s worth visiting at least once in your lifetime.

The art museums in Prague hold some great works of art that you need to see during your trip. Why listen to my recommendations? I am an artist and I’ve been living in the Czech Republic for 10 months now. In this article, I am sharing with you the must-see art museums in Prague.
Read next: 6 Art Museums in Florence: The masterpieces you need to
I am starting with the Lubkowicz Palace because it holds a collection of artifacts that tell the most about Czech history.
The Palace entry ticket comes with an audio-guide that helps you explore Bohemian and European history through the Lobkowicz family and their collections — one of Europe’s oldest and finest private art collections, comprised of items dating back over 2,000 years. The collection highlights include paintings by Bruegel the Elder, Canaletto, and Velázquez and hand-annotated manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven.
P.S: The audio guide is narrated in English by two generations of the Lobkowicz family and the collections’ curators (also available in 10 other languages). The additional Prague InSpires Panorama audiotour introduces visitors to the city’s most iconic landmarks in under 30 minutes from the Lobkowicz Palace balcony.
My favorite museum in Prague is the national gallery (not to be confused with the national museum). With origins dating back to the 18th century, it is one of the oldest, largest, and most respected art museums in Central Europe. What makes this gallery unique is that its collections are spread out in various Baroque palaces, Medieval convents, and castles all around Prague. So, it is not one building but many different building. You can check out the official website for more details on the different buildings, opening hours, and ticket prices.
The National Gallery is particularly well-known for its wide collection of modern artists such as Picasso, Rousseau, Monet, and Cézanne. the National Gallery has an extensive collection of works by great Czech artists.
One of the most recognizable works in the National Gallery’s collection is Vincent van Gogh’s Green Field (1889). This is one of many landscape paintings Van Gogh produced while recovering at a mental asylum in Provence and it shows the painter at the height of his creative powers.
A not-so-popular museum, but if you are an art enthusiast, you definitely know the iconic master of Art Nouveau Alphonse Mucha. However, you may not know that he was actually Czech because he mostly lived in Paris during the Art Nouveau period. Mucha produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, and designs, which became among the best-known images of the period. For that, I think the museum deserves a visit.
At the age of 57, Mucha returned to his homeland and devoted himself to a series of twenty monumental symbolist canvases known as The Slav Epic, depicting the history of the Slavic people. On the 10th anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered The Slav Epic his most important work.
Not really an art museum but the Clementinum is Prague’s second-largest building complex after Prague Castle and houses the most beautiful library in the world. Among the 27,000 old printed works, there are, for example, Kepler’s writings with his handwritten dedication to his friends, the dean, and other professors at the Prague university. The Jesuits founded the Clementinum in 1556 and named it after the former Dominican monastery of St. Clement from 1227, where they settled. In 1775, meteorological data began to be collected here regularly; thus Prague has the longest continuous series of meteorological observations in Europe.
Prague is a gorgeous city that holds a significant number of museums and historical attractions. If I were to pick only one art museum to see in Prague, I’d visit The National Gallery, as it is the richest, widest and most interesting art collection in Prague. However, make sure to, once in yo

I lived in the greater Seattle area for three years. I’ve lived in Prague for five months. Here’s my take on the wins and losses in both countries.
1Topic: SmokingWinner: Seattle
As a lifelong non-smoker, I define a country’s smoking success as having less of a smoking culture. Compared to the US, Prague has a huge smoking culture. According to data from the Czech National Cancer Control Programme, about 25% of Czechs smoke, compared to approximately 15% of Americans.
Anecdotally, I’ve noticed much more smoking on the sidewalks, in parks, and in the outdoor sections of restaurants in Prague than in the US. Every time I walk through a smoke cloud in Prague, I long for the US.
2Topic: DogsWinner: Prague
If you’re a dog-lover, Prague has two really awesome parts of dog culture that make it better than the US:
3Topic: Dog PoopWinner: Seattle
Czechs don’t pick up dog poop. :( I almost had to stop picking up my dog’s poop in Prague because I physically could not find anywhere to buy poop bags and could not consistently find publicly-provided ones. For months, I lived off the supply I brought from the US, then finally restocked when I was on vacation in Asia.
But don’t take my word for it. A reply on a TripAdvisor forum went as far as to encourage people to not pick up dog poop, as it labeled you as a foreigner. And this poignant excerpt from the Czech Expats page, titled “Poo Fighters” (the Seattlite in me approves of the title), explains the issue even better:
There’s the issue of doggy do-do. However positively disposed you are towards our four-legged friends, no-one enjoys stepping in a steaming pile of poop. Yet despite all those green disposal bins supplied with free brown, erm, doggy bags, some owners persistently fail to clear up after their pets… Matters have become so serious that Prague 7’s district council is considering DNA testing feces at the scene of the crime in order to track down the responsible pooches.
I don’t think I’ve ever stepped in dog poop in the US. In Prague, I’ve stepped in it more than half a dozen times. Get your shit together, Prague. Literally.
4Topic: Public TransportWinner: Prague
If you want reliable, dependable, and affordable public transport, Prague is an easy choice. On a normal weekday, if you miss your metro, the next one is only two minutes away. Two. Minutes. From this list of best global public transportation, Prague ranks within the top 25:
In the US, conversely, public transport is a nightmare of inconsistent times on incomplete routes. I can personally speak to the abhorrent public transportation Pittsburgh offered during my college years; with the minor experience I’ve accumulated, I can also briefly speak to Seattle’s public transport. That said, with the exception of New York, none of them compares with any of the public transport systems I’ve used in Europe. For the curious, Now This News covered the historical reasons why the US is transportationally behind the rest of the world (summary: we chose highways).
5Topic: Health CareWinner: Prague
I caught a lung infection within my first two months in Prague. I went to the doctor but didn’t have my work-supplied insurance card yet. They charged me without insurance for an emergency, unscheduled visit with a nurse practitioner. I approached the checkout desk post-appointment, waiting for the immense sans-insurance bill. As I stood, cringing, watching the lips of the receptionist read out my balance, seemingly in slow motion, it was… $35. Without insurance.
In the US, my boyfriend had some blood tests done in a scheduled appointment and was charged $1,500 post-insurance. Prague obviously wins here.
It’s not just cost, however. It’s also coverage. In the Czech Republic, every citizen is by-default insured. In the US, over 10% of adults do not have health insurance. Health insurance for all is definitely a win.
You go, Czech Republic.
6Topic: Automatic Sliding DoorsWinner: Seattle
Sliding doors in the Czech Republic have two major issues:
In the US, sliding doors open in such a way that you just keep walking, and the doors will move to not impede your pace. Czech doors, in contrast, will open after you’ve been standing in front of them for a few seconds. On my first day in Prague I tried to enter a mall, but the sliding doors weren’t sliding. I figured the mall was still closed. It wasn’t. I just didn’t wait long enough for the sliding doors to engage. I texted my American friend living in Denmark about it. She confirmed that European sliding doors just suck.
I only have anecdotal and social evidence to back up my claims, however, I know I’m not the only one to have noticed this. I don’t know this person, but based on their rant, I can tell we’re soulmates in another life:
2. The doors have different opening widths depending on the season
Czech sliding doors open less in winter. I get it, they save energy. However, this algorithm has a ton of problems. First, you get used to one opening width and then have to acclimate to another. This wouldn’t be a problem, except that you’re usually not paying much attention to the doors when walking through them. Suddenly — SURPRISE. They unexpectedly open narrower than they used to and you walk into the door. I wish I were kidding, but the sliding glass doors at my work cracked in the winter, I presume for this very reason.
And second, the narrow width is a huge bottleneck. Luckily, waiting outside doors in the winter is one of my favorite pastimes. Oh wait, it’s not.
Get with it Prague.
7Topic: Drinking CultureWinner: Prague
US drinking law: No open alcohol on the streets, absolutely no open containers in cars, and .08 BAC to drive. And that .08 BAC is something a drunk person has to self-gauge. Ne dobry (that means “not good” in Czech).
Prague drinking law: Open alcohol containers are mostly legal, open containers in the car are fine as long as the driver doesn’t partake, and drivers must have 0 BAC. There’s no tolerance for drunk driving, or even buzzed driving, in the Czech Republic. 👍
The Prague drinking laws make Czech drinking culture less restrictive for people enjoying responsibly. Additionally, they’re not so strict that they ironically encourage more drinking, like in the US, where paper-bagging alcohol or hiding alcohol in a bottle of Gatorade is a common sight. And finally, the zero-tolerance rule for drivers makes drunk driving less prevalent in Europe.
In the US, alcohol is involved in 23% of traffic-related deaths. In the Czech Republic, that same statistic is 4%. And the Czech Republic is one of the worst offenders in the EU.
8Topic: ShoppingWinner: Seattle
You know what I miss about the US? Target. Need to find some obscure household item? Target has it. Target doesn’t have it? Amazon surely does.
What happens in the Czech Republic? Well, if you want to find that same obscure household item… well, you can go to… fuck it, I don’t know. There are no major shopping centers like Target or Walmart. Think you can turn to Amazon next? Nope, there’s no Amazon in the Czech Republic. Your only options are to use Germany’s Amazon service, or the Czech Republic’s Amazon equivalent, Alza.cz.
I miss you, US shopping. ❤
9Topic: TechnologyWinner: Seattle
One of Prague’s charms is its rustic, classic look. The streets are still cobblestone, the buildings are still original. Apparently, Prague is so beautiful that Hitler himself was inspired to spare it. Consequently, it’s one of the few places in this part of Europe that wasn’t bombed in WWII, so it’s one rarity that preserved its vintage appearance.
Unfortunately, that old-school culture also makes Prague lag the rest of the world in adoption and prevalence of technology. Do you enjoy elevators? Get ready to use some slow, old, questionable elevators that you’re not sure will hold your weight. The one in my apartment building doesn’t even have up or down buttons — just a call button. When my dog chewed up my laptop charging cord, I quickly found out I couldn’t get a replacement in the Czech Republic (luckily, my work had an extra lying around). When I lost my Fitbit charger, I was forced to order one from Amazon Germany.
This carries on to other parts of daily life. When I was apartment hunting, almost nobody accepted emails. You had to call, and calling meant you had to speak Czech. Welp.
Welcome to the shitshow that is the Czech technology scene. Missing you rn, America.
10Topic: Customer ServiceWinner: Seattle
Need help at a store? Czechs don’t give a fuck. Want a shopping cart? Gotta put in a coin to get one. Want a bag for your items? Gotta pay for that too. Need a restroom while shopping? Get ready to pay again.
Generally, Czech store representatives and systems are ruder, less-helpful, and more prohibitive than in the US. It’s even worse if they figure out you’re a foreigner.
Check out this poignant quote and related article with more formalized data on Czech customer service:
In the Czech Republic, a basic lack of understanding of the minimum level of courtesy required when dealing with the public seems all too widespread — and it’s costing companies dearly. A survey by telecommunications firm Genesys estimates that Czech businesses lose 1.08 billion US dollars annually because of substandard customer service.
11Topic: Elderly CommunityWinner: Prague
Perhaps because of the prevalence of public transport and the de-emphasis of cars, elderly people are active and all over Prague. It’s really refreshing to see independent elderly people around the city, a rare sight in the US. If you want to stay active in your senior years, I’d prescribe Prague.
12Topic: BathroomsWinner: Prague
Do you love knowing who’s in the bathroom with you based on the shoes sticking out beneath the stalls? Making eye contact through the stall gap? Do you enjoy people hearing you poop? And hearing other people poop?
Europe has none of these things. Water closets are God’s gift to relieving yourself. They’re little, private, sealed, closed rooms where you can do your business discretely and in peace. Mmmmmm.
The only downside is that Europe has a bad habit of charging for bathrooms. But with bathrooms this delightful, I’ll take it.
Topic: WaterWinner: Seattle
I ask for few things in life. One of them, however, is free, still, ice water without a lemon in it. Seattle gets this. Prague does not. Most Czech restaurants don’t offer free water, and when you ask for water, they offer you the option of still or sparkling. And when your paid-for, over-specified water does arrive, it usually includes a lemon. And no ice. Shame on you Prague.
(I realize that most of this is personal preference. Please indulge my rant)
And there you have it! What I love and don’t love about my two homes, Prague and Seattle. Did you come to the end of this article looking for me to call a winner? I’m sorry to disappoint. Both cities have a special place in my heart.

Just two girls on a city break with a fascination with pretty buildings.
The Old Town in Prague, Zone 1, is bustling with amazing architecture, Czech landmarks and an abundance of food stalls, restaurants and shops. Before departing on our break, my friend and I had a list of attractions we were keen to see which included the well-known Astronomical clock, the infinite book tower in the Municipal Library and the rotating Kafka head. However, we found that simply walking down the street was entertainment enough. Both of us were in awe of the city’s creative architecture, clean streets and colourful buildings. This combined with the cobbled paths, countless clocks and mini archways connecting buildings together had me convinced that I should be moving to Prague some time in my future. The use of space here was so appealing and interesting, with charming restaurants providing seating under mini bridges — I was overcome with endless things to look at and appreciate. In the two and a half days and 60,000 steps we were there for, we Czech-ed everything off our list and left eager to return.
Day one was a travel day, and, after an early start and some unexpected extra leg room seats, we arrived at our hotel located twenty minutes’ walk outside of the Old Town. With no real idea of where we were going, and no knowledge of direction between us, we set off in the general direction of the ‘city centre.’ As it turned out, we were soon met with a high street of stores, food places and souvenir shops. Even the architecture of familiar shops we regularly frequent at home, such as H&M and Zara, had us amazed with their intricate brick work and elegant lighting. We came across a market with stalls selling fresh fruit and souvenirs before accidentally, but fortunately, arriving in the Old Town Square — location of the Astronomical clock. The square was beautiful with outdoor seating, stringed fairy lights and once again, the cool Czech architecture. After, of course, taking some pictures we joined a crowd of people gathered around the oldest clock still in operation and wondered what we were waiting for. As the five o’clock hour hit, we all watched in silence as the clock chimed with a little “cuckoo” at the end. Also, we found the Sex museum which gave us lots of laughs as there is a chair in the entrance way with a ‘Love Tester’ scale rating you from frozen to sex bomb. My friend and I were disappointed to find out that we were ‘tepid’ and ‘frozen’ and left once I’d had another go to determine that I am in fact ‘boiling’ and the first try was just a practise. Afterwards, we headed in the direction of shops we knew we couldn’t afford for some window shopping and more picture taking. We stared gormlessly at handbags and amazing coats in the likes of Dior, Prada and Louis Vuitton before admitting defeat and going in search of food. For our first night, we decided to tick off Prague’s hard rock café and enjoyed some great food there before heading homewards for an early night.
Prague day two began with a slow start, still sleepy from the early rise the day prior. However, arriving at the breakfast buffet, coupled with some strong coffee, eased away our tiredness and we vaguely planned out our day. Our plan was to firm the queue outside the Municipal library in order to see the infinite book tower but once again, our poor sense of direction lead us to a different landmark on our list. We stopped and took in the rotating Kafka head before agreeing it was time to pull out apple maps and stick to our plan. After queueing for about 30–40 minutes on a hot, sunny day in Czech we approached the tower of books. The illusion this tower creates through the use of mirrors is incredible — when you look down it feels like if you stepped through you would fall forever. This was a hotspot for tourists from all over the world and many pictures were taken here. The tower contains around 8,000 books and I would highly recommend this attraction. The heat and the walking had us hungry, so we headed around the corner to a little café called ‘Coffee and Waffles’ recommended to us on TikTok and as described, we ordered a coffee and waffle each. They had some very interesting waffle and coffee choices — I had a caprese waffle and my friend had a Crème Brulé coffee, which I was jealous I didn’t get myself. The atmosphere inside was calming and lovely and I enjoyed my first savoury waffle — even if it did take a minute to get used to the variety of textures. Our afternoon consisted of shopping… we couldn’t help ourselves! We each bought clothes to wear to dinner that night and headed to the hotel in the evening to change for dinner. As our day had been so jam packed and busy, we had lost track of timing and the restaurant we had planned to visit for dinner was fully booked (this place was called Pasta Fresca and was also fully booked the next evening too so I would recommend booking well in advance as it must be popular). However, we found another lovely Italian place not far from it and enjoyed dinner outside whilst people watching and discussing our day. Once we’d settled the bill, we headed back to the centre to grab a chimney cake. These are absolutely amazing — a chimney shaped dough with fillings such as ice cream or chocolate and strawberries. This was definitely a tourist staple! After forcing our stomachs to accept more food, we went to bed, sad to be heading into our last day in Prague.
Another hot and sunny day commenced, and we set off walking around more cool buildings and churches that we had missed the last two days. Today was the day for some souvenir shopping and presents for family and friends. There were so many options for these kinds of gifts and, after purchasing some postcards, we moved onto a place we had clocked on our first day. This shop is called Candy Miners and is a pick n mix shop where all the sweets are stored in old miners’ carriages and scales. The experience was really cool, and the sweets contained some unique and interesting shapes and flavours. We spent some time in there selecting an assortment of sweets for our partners. We also headed to the chocolate museum and shop which, again, had some very curious flavours to try — and a lot of phallic shaped chocolate (not very appropriate for the parents!). All of this shopping had us thirsty, so we found a nice juice bar — come — café and sat down outside for a relax. For dinner on our last night, we found another highly recommended place from TikTok (where we apparently get all of our travel advice) and walked over to Prague 2. The place is called Hoxton burgers, and it was ten out of ten. We each got a beef smashed burger, passion fruit lemonade and shared a loaded bacon cheesy fries. The atmosphere and lighting were very unique and edgy and, once again, we were full to bursting. Finally, we made our way across the road to the church of St Ludmila, which was extremely pretty, and took our last pictures in Prague before returning to the hotel to pack and prepare for our early morning flight.
All in all, Prague was a fantastic city break and my friend and I are both keen to return. I think that next time I go, I would like to try more traditional Czech food and visit some of the other zones as the majority of our time was spent in Prague zone 1 and 2. In terms of the city itself, the area was extremely clean and well presented and Czech residents were exceptionally lovely and considerate.
I hope you enjoyed reading! :)

GETTING MY HAIRCUT while traveling is something that I still can’t take in my stride. Because of this I now look like one of those Barber: What you want? memes. Here’s my easy step-by-step guide on how not to get a haircut in a foreign country. Haircuts, as they say, are 20:20.
There are two key factors you should aim for when truly trying to devastate your hairdo: laziness and language barriers. Thankfully, I achieved both.Laziness, over time, will allow your hair to look odd. It grows this way and that- always unevenly, of course. Eventually, it will evolve to a look bad enough that if you bump into someone you hadn’t seen in a while they feel obliged to ask “Everything okay man?”
By this stage you start to think ‘You know what? A bad haircut probably wouldn’t be worse than this.’(*Note* If you reach this point, remind yourself: a bad haircut is, in fact, much worse).
This morning, I had that incorrect thought. It was time to get a haircut in Prague.
‘The difference between a good haircut and a bad one is a couple of weeks’ my Granny says. As an Irishman, I would never be seen to disagree with my grandmother. But, come to think about it: A travel blog is the safest place to dispute your 93-year old Granny’s opinion and get away with it.
That’s if I was to do it. Which I would not.
As mentioned, my hair was more than unruly. It was bordering on passers-by questioning my mental health. Too short to be long hair; too long to be considered short. I looked tragic.
I had 2 work meetings on Google Hangouts later that day. Not the phone ones in your PJs. Video ones where you need to appear compos mentis.It seemed as good a day as any to smarten up.
I researched some Prague barbers and found plenty. There was an American Expat website that offered some decent options. Weighing them all up, I decided it would be best to procrastinate.
I took a break from helpful research and watched YouTube videos on ‘How To Cut Your Own Hair’ instead. Almost all of them were imitating a David Beckham haircut of one time or other.
Could I do this myself? I had my own lightweight electric razor…
Could I ask my wife, perhaps? Remembering our hostile afternoon in Cape Cod after how I reacted to her previous attempt, I thought better of it. Back to Google.
It ultimately came down to discovering the barbers closest to Prague’s Old Town Square, where I am staying. I reviewed the reviews and set my sights on their sites. One, in particular, seemed slick.
The website and Facebook page gave a good first impression. It spoke to my need to think that I’m cool and stylish at 31. Even the translation for tutto barbuto- ‘fully bearded’- was pretty badass.
Customers drank scotches and smoked shisha in the online pictures. Smoking Hookah isn’t my thing. But drinking scotch while getting a haircut would be great to tick off the bucket list. It was 10am.
My wife Rachael and I embarked on the 6-min journey by foot from the Old Town Square to Tutto Barbuto.
By Prague standards, it was mild although my toes were beginning to lose sensation.
Flecks of snow fell lazily on the streets, too few and far between to ever last.When we found Tutto Barbutto, it was dark and empty. For a moment, I thought it was closed.
Before turning to leave, I hurled a tentative ‘Dobrý den?’ towards the back of the shop. A small woman, maybe 26, emerged immediately, greeting me in Czech.
-I’m sorry, but do you speak English?-No.
We were off to the perfect start.
We were at an impasse. She had been clear she didn’t speak English. I had zero Czech but 2 impending Google Hangouts. Not to mention, the 99 problems growing out of my head. I decided to push through in English.
-Are you open?
-Yes.
That was good enough for me. I removed my coat and scarf then sat into the barber’s chair.
The lady who was about to cut my hair had dark features and a Marilyn Monroe portrait on her inner arm. I produced my phone to show her the picture I had screen-shotted as inspiration for whoever cut my hair.
This screenshot technique always strikes me as awkward. You can’t show them a photo of somebody who is tooooo attractive or it feels as if your drawing comparisons between yourself and the male model staring back at them dreamily from your phone.
Even the act of providing a photo is something I steer clear from when home in Ireland. Doing anything outside what is seen as standard behavior could be met with the most withering critique an Irish person can give a compatriot:
“He’s getting notions about himself”.
Looking at the screenshot, she zoomed in.
“Very fastidious,” I thought.
She could have been thinking “This man has notions,” in Czech.
To reaffirm we were on the same page, I pointed to the side of my head- albeit, an overgrown one- and said “Very short”. Then I helpfully pointed to the top of my head and said “Long”.
I find myself in these lost in translation moments regularly. While in the midst of them, I hope that a sizable smile will fill the gaps and encourage my opposite number to give me the benefit of the doubt while I point at my head and say random words.
-Zero blade?-No, thanks. A one.
I’m sure I held up one finger and accompanied it with another oversmile.
After a quick wash, the razor purred and hairs began to drop. So long, old friends.
She was painstaking and focused, spending what seemed like 15 minutes on the sides alone. It looked terrific. Suddenly the phone rang and she went to retrieve it.
Rachael came over to the chair for a moment and we both talked about how good I looked before the hairdresser returned.
I’m a long term insomniac and the night before had been rough. I had laid awake from 3.30am-7 before giving up the ghost of sleep and getting up to work out. It was only 10.30 in the morning, but I’d already been awake 7 hours. My eyes were heavy.
And now that the adrenaline was wearing off since my hairdresser was so good, I wasn’t sure I would be able to stay awake in the warm barbershop.Snip.
She chopped about three inches from my hair in one fell swoop. She had clearly experienced my universal gesture of point-at-top-of-head-and-say-long though. Or had she? I waited to see.
Snip.
Snip-snip. Snipsnipsnip.
I looked in stunned silence waiting for her to stop. She didn’t.
While I knew I needed a serious cut, I had expected to leave with much more hair to brave the bitter Prague weather. That protective layer of hair now lay on the floor beneath me.
As I write this now, it seems so stupid. Why not just stop her? There was something that was making me give her the benefit of the doubt, though. I felt like she had a plan.
Turns out she really didn’t.
Rach had been on her phone for the last few hellacious minutes. In the mirror, I saw her look up.
“Keith!”
I ignored her call, trying to look calm as if this was all my plan. The man with the plan.
“KEITH” she called again, louder.
I looked at her in eyebrow-raised resignation. Edwina Scissorhands chopped on, oblivious
Rach jumped out of her seat and walked towards the blizzard of hair.
“You’ve cut it too short!”
The hairdresser paused. After a moment she said:
“Was damaged.”
“It’s fine,” I said to no one in particular in consummate Irishness.
And it was fine. Just about as fine as looking like an idiot can be. The strangest think about my Prague haircut was that, at the end, she shaved back my hairline a half-inch or so.
Image of google screenshot for Prague hairdresser and how it turned out.Can you spot the difference between my Prague haircut and the model?When she finished, it didn’t look so bad. I won’t claim I looked good but it could have been worse. Through a combo or blow-drying and hair-spraying, she made it seem like she hadn’t scalped me.
Stepping away from the scene of the massacre, that big broad smile from earlier was a little more difficult to muster. But muster it I did; long enough to pay the 569 Czech Koruna (about $23).
Then I did what any self-respected Irish person would do.I thanked her and left a tip.

Prague
I had not heard a single negative thing about Prague before arriving — most of the travelers I had encountered prior had preached about how amazing of a city it is. This had my expectations sky-high for the Czech city, which I hereby declare the Interstellar Mistake (Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Hans Zimmer, reality-based space sci-fi… how could it have not been the best film of all time?!) When I only get to visit a place for a few days, my entire perception of it is largely dependent on the weather while I’m there (Ireland is beautifully sunny and warm, in case you were unaware). Unfortunately for me, my visit to Prague was accompanied by clouds, rain, and cold weather.
That said, it still is architecturally a magnificent place, thanks partially to it not being blown up by war. After all the historically significant, gigantic, celebrated churches I’ve seen over the past three months, the Gothic churches of Prague are far and away my favorite. The charred-looking stone and ridiculously intricate gold and black ornamentation stand out prominently above the other buildings of the city. The largest of these, St. Vitus Cathedral, sits in the middle of the Prague castle on the top of a hill overlooking the Vltava river. The castle itself is a pretty well protected peek into the past, with the palace, churches, shops, and residencies that once inhabited the space within the castle walls.
Another thing Prague does do well is public / street art. This is also most definitely in response to Soviet rule of the city. One particular space called the “Lennon Wall” celebrates the freedom to write anything on a public wall without an authority covering it up. Every day, hundreds of people come by and paint their own drawings and words on the wall, which is now feet thicker due to so many coats of paint. Beyond this street art, there are many humorous statues with implied political meaning, such as giant bronze babies with barcodes instead of faces, and two men urinating in a pool shaped as the Czech Republic. I don’t exactly remember the point of that one, but it’s funny nonetheless. Hopefully one day I’ll be able to return to Prague under clearer weather and lower expectations, and be able to thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the place.

Prague is beautiful and it never lets you go. If you are lucky enough to visit it, then likely you will end up doing the same things the majority of the tourists do: sightsee Prague Castle, shop at the Old Town square, take a picture near the John Lennon wall and cross Charles Bridge.
There is nothing wrong with checking all the “touristy attractions”, but there is just so much more to Prague, and I would not like you to miss that. When you take a few steps away from Prague’s most famous spots— a world brimming with lively culture opens up.
I was born in Prague and even if I lived in other cities, Prague will be always my hometown. It is a beautiful and unique city with many things to do and see. I will show you some secret, local-approved things you must do when in Prague. Here they are.
I strongly recommend checking the lesser-known 10th-century castle of Vysehrad. It offers some great views of the river and the city but also features lovely grounds perfect for picnics and gatherings with friends. Some of…

Prague of David Černý,https://medium.com/@miswid/prague-of-david-%C4%8Dern%C3%BD-bb4b408e024a,"Sign up

When you visit Prague, the list of landmarks to see is quite obvious — The Prague Castle, Old Town, Charles Bridge with its famous statues. But between them you may find some strange… things, let’s say. In such a case, it’s very possible you’ve just come across the work of Czech artist, David Černý. And as strange as they are, all of them are worth seeing.
Here’s the shortlist of his work list — for more, visit davidcerny.cz
One of the most characteristic sculptures of Černý is St. Wenceslas riding a dead horse, hanging in the passage of Lucerna Palace.
If you have already walked on the nearby Wenceslas Square, you might think this looks somehow familiar. Indeed, this sculpture was inspired by the famous Statue of Saint Wenceslas. It’s even the same in size. But the horse is dead, and upside down. Don’t ask. Allegedly, it represents the idea of thinking that everything is fine, even if it’s not.
Nevertheless, move to the nearby Quadrio Shopping Centre — to its back entrance, to be precise. You won’t miss the enormous, steel sculpture of Franz Kafka, the famous Austrian-Czech writer. His head, to be precise.
It’s 10 meters tall and made of 42 rotating stainless steel panels. It doesn’t really belong to the Old Town, which is probably the best reason for placing it right there (it stands on the private ground). The Czech sense of humor.
Speaking of heads, one of the most recent works is the monument of Trifot, 12-meter tall sculpture inspired by Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham. To reach it, you should take Metro Line B and get out at Nove Butovice station.
The eyes of the Trifot are actually camera lenses, which are able to take the photos of passers-by. And those photos can be shown on the nearby screens (unfortunately, this was out of order in 2023, when I visited Prague — don’t know if it works now). Quite a nod to the omnipresent user tracking.
But Černý’s work is not limited to sculptures only. You can see the part of him in everyday objects. Like the counter top in Mlynska Cafe (Kavárna Mlýnská) in Kampa Park.
Partly a pub, partly a cafe, Mlynska serves as a cozy place for a drink, located in an old mill. If you sit at the bar, you’ll notice a unique counter top created by Černý. It’s actually a mix of rubbish found in Vltava, and random stuff left by the visitors — all immersed in an artificial resin. In a certain sense, it’s a picture of local life, stuck forever like archaeological treasures on a museum exhibition.
Speaking of museums, if you want to explore the world of David Černý’s mind, you should visit Musoleum, where you’ll find many of his other works, including Entropa, his variation on European Union countries.
Oddly enough, even though the work was unveiled in 2009, United Kingdom is not represented (in other words, represented as a missing piece) in the sculpture. It was then a symbol of British isolation from Europe, and only predicted Brexit 7 yeards later.

Prague is a European city I’ve always wanted to visit.
Since I was a child, I marveled at images of its cobblestone streets and remarkable buildings. So, when I got a chance to visit Prague for 24 hours, I was determined to make the most of the opportunity.
Here’s how I spent 24 hours in Prague:
My boyfriend and I woke up bright and early, buzzing with excitement for the day ahead. As we left our hotel room and wandered the cobblestone streets, we found the city quite empty before 8 am.
We heard a rumor that many people sleep in after a fun night out of drinking. After all, beer is often cheaper than bottled water, and Czechs consume more beer per capita than any other country in the world.
We were relieved to have a quieter beginning to the day. Yesterday, when we’d wheeled our suitcases from the bus stop to our hotel, we realized that many crosswalks in Prague did not have pedestrian signals. Most of the time…

August 28, 2012.
I had just finished my dietetic internship in NYC at the hospital formerly known as Beth Israel Medical Center, now transitioned to Mount Sinai, and I felt a sense of freedom. Where better to reap the benefits of this long-lost feeling than wander around Eastern Europe, specifically Bohemia, specifically Prague?
I hopped on an ICE fast train from Leipzig, Germany to Prague. Back then I had no smartphone, and I used a paper map to guide my way through the winding European streets. I got around just fine, except for that one time I was lost in the rain at 2 am. I did eventually find my way back to the Hotel Sunflower.
One thing I pack with me while traveling is a notebook and pen to write down thoughts, ideas, things I would like to do and see; places to eat and drink. My weekend in Bohemia included a typical tourist visit to Prague Castle and the Staropramen Brewery, yet it also included some not-for-tourist places such as Tynska Bar & Books, and this other place I had read about that was known for its vegetarian food in the land of pork knuckle and dumplings. The Czech name of the restaurant is Lehka Hlava, which translates to Clear Head.
Perfect, I thought. The name called to me after my long-lost night. I needed to clear my head.
After I arrived and was taken to my table at the restaurant I noticed a table of four women near my table of one. They were laughing, and enjoying their food and wine. Seeing them made me miss my friends back home. I bounced back into the present and ordered a full meal complete with a starter, a main, and a dessert with one glass of wine.
Looking back all these years later I cannot remember exactly what I ordered, but I do remember that the meal I had that evening in Prague was the best meal I had while traveling Bohemia. I remember the bill was equivalent to about 12 US dollars, which has been embedded into my memory since I was a graduate student at NYU at the time— not rich in money, but rich in books.
Although I cannot recall exactly what I chose on the menu nor did I take any photos of it, I do know that my solo dining experience was welcomed, and the food was honestly delicious.
Now many years later I glance at the menu on my computer. It includes items such as pumpkin and ginger soup with orange juice, vegetable consommé with yeast dumplings, spaghetti with tempeh bacon and sauce of baked garlic, gértaix — cheese balls with cumin sticks, wasabi dressing, and balsamic reduction, Kimchi-potato pancake — traditional Czech potato pancake with kimchi and spring onion, and hot raspberry crumble with mascarpone-ricotta cream.
The menu reflects the diversity of the chefs at Lehka Hlava, and each dish has a goal to both electrify and soothe the senses. I still think about this restaurant now and then. It pops into my mind as “those carefree days.” It was such a relaxing atmosphere and left me with a sense of, well, clarity. I left Prague happy and with lucidity. I did not get lost that night with my paper map.

“I don’t have a girlfriend, but I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that.”
-Mitch
I decided on Prague next because Kevin had told me you can get wasted there for 5 bucks. That was enough for me. Kevin always knows the right move. Except for the time he jumped into the Chicago River, drunk as hell, to rescue a shoe. That was dumb. The Czech Republic had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
The only issue with Prague was the overnight, 14-hour train ride I needed to take to get there. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to go. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost the equivalent of 4 Euros/night (about $6 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be 3 hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is some deceptive bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand am/pm clocks?
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were torched. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was just me and a few other people who also couldn’t tell time.
*
April 4, 2006
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple mini baguettes and a bunch of bananas to supplement. I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, lying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling and nodding. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
I put my index finger up, the international sign for “wait a minute,” and went to the bar car to grab four cups. I took some Adderall too, knowing that it was no longer going to be a Tylenol PM type of night. Drugs allow you to execute hairpin turns like an F1 driver.
Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they stood and received their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all good and drunk, telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; four guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dad thoughts.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train and ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like city; the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of walking and smoking, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel.” They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was. Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. I wanted to thank them to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me in what I assumed was Czech for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics. Only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad. When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Nevercomment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in the middle of the night. It’s best to just listen.
*
When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. It looked like the Catacombs, minus the bones. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon because it was my grandfather’s name, and because I’ve never known a sane Simon. When I was a kid, I went to camp with a Simon who got expelled for torturing animals. And then there was the Simon I knew in Iowa whose party trick was chewing glass and swallowing it. Tons of deviant Simons are roaming the earth unchecked, and it worries me.
Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday.” (The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX). She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was more of a single-cheek, shy smirk, than an all-out smile. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows, and was dressed casually, in blue jeans and a V-neck sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I can usually spot a fellow speed freak, so I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a stumble until the bars opened so he could extend his bender another day.
*
April 5, 2006
When I came down to the common area the next morning, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. Again, I’m looking at you, London. I was impressed the way she carried herself in the kitchen, and by her motherly sensibilities. She took on the role of “hostel mom” naturally, making sure everyone had a homemade meal before embarking on the day. That really attracted me. (Freud would have another field day with me liking mom-types).
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. It’s so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class Americans wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happen in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were dating.
*
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: We are, Johnny… I’m the umpire so I have final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick.
“Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular in its’ simplicity. It reminded me of a hotel conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer.
When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We pulled up seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked the beers over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on out we were old friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid onto the table. I knew moonshine when I saw it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could see straight. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others cackled. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech music and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling. Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching like Dave used to. Every time we got close, he’d scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: (sarcastically) Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar, where we drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: Running from my feelings? Trying to become my own man? I’m not totally sure anymore. Since my dad died last year, I just can’t stop speeding, that’s all I know.
Caroline: I understand.
Me: Do you?
Caroline: My younger brother died in a car crash last year.
Me: So, you’re doing the same thing?
Caroline: Yeah. I keep telling myself that running away from something means you’re running towards something else, but lately it hasn’t been working. So, I came here to forget myself altogether.
Me: How’s that working?
Caroline: It’s not really. Grief is just a cunt.
Me: Same and same.
Caroline: How about we run together and if that makes it any better?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I hear Bratislava is nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t watch it between now and tomorrow.

Which part of Himachal are you from?I am actually not from Himachal, but from Madhya Pradesh.But you’re a Thakur?Yes, MP as well has Thakurs.
This is how my first interaction with most people at Himachal Pradesh (the northern state that hosts my workplace IIT Mandi) begins, people with last name Thakur being omnipresent here. However, perhaps the most famous Thakur was from West Bengal (a state in the East of India), and interestingly, he is known more commonly as a Tagore in India. At Prague — the city of hundred spires — though, my stay was booked at Thakurova — the Thakur street — and so I knew I would be welcome at Czechia.
My trip to Boston (recall Tryst with America?) had made me acquaintance with Prof. Jan Vitek’s group at Northeastern University. I met him again during ECOOP 2019 (recall Romance at London?) — we knew we were working in similar areas — so he suggested I visit his laboratory at Czech Technical University, where I would hopefully be able to formalize a working relationship. And thus the seed to a trip to Prague — one of my most memorable trips ever — was sown.
In general I would have been worried about the cold weather at Prague in January. However, having settled after the London trip at Mandi, in one of the coldest states of India, I wasn’t much excited (read worried) about the weather. This, however, also translated to not being prepared for the trip at all. My first teaching semester at IIT Mandi ended in December, and it was only after that, that I started planning a trip — my longest abroad till date — to Prague in January. Two things I was more thoughtful about, though, were (i) The Visa; and (ii) The Trip to Delhi — you will get to know a very suspenseful story about both in Rendezvous with Athena. TLDR: The Visa was smooth, I travelled to Delhi a day before this time, and hence obtained a comfortable flight hopping for an hour at Sharjah (the place I knew from childhood for Cricket matches).
Prague is known to be a beautiful city, and a very welcoming one for tourists. I was supposed to stay 12 nights at a hostel-cum-hotel (wrongly known as a dorm) named Masaryk Colej. The second word indicates its association with the college CVUT (Czech Technical University, in English). Travel from the airport was quite comfortable: you buy an hourly ticket for public travel in Prague and can then take any bus, tram, or metro — very convenient for those who don’t understand the currency or the local addresses. So I took a bus and a tram (Pristi zastavka) and reached the hotel. First surprise: I was provided with a map to find my room! And indeed, the map was damn useful — you need to pass through a cobweb of rooms (smelling the varieties of food college guys keep cooking in there) to finally reach the corridor that forms the “hotel” part of the huge building. I needed the map on quite a few occasions (specially when I decided to wander around the building trying to get a glimpse of the food).
I used to walk daily to the university, take the lift to the 13th floor (tried the stairs one day!), and come back in the evening. Pretty standard. So what I would do next, is to mainly discuss the interesting trips — solo as well as group — along with the classical places I visited, the people I met, and the heart-warming experiences that I got in the extremely cold weather (subzero on almost all days). Not to forget the funny stories surrounding the food!
This was the first time I was visiting a place that’s famous for its exotic food — but almost all non-veg. The first day I located a Pizza outlet with vegetarian options, about 1.5 miles from my hotel. I had taken my warmest clothes, but God it was really difficult following Google Map as you need to take your gloves off (I got enlightened about touchscreen-enabled gloves much later). Being in Europe I knew I didn’t have to worry much about tips and the phrases for taking home versus dining-in as in the US (Europe and India have pretty much similar terminologies, owing to history). Breakfasts were taken care of by the hotel (with two kinds of cupcakes, orange juice, toast, and cheese forming the 365-day menu). Lunches (and some dinner outings on weekdays): I knew I would have enough expertise from the lab in sailing through the university canteen. However, things became adventurous when I decided to try the hotel restaurant for a dinner:
Me: “Which all options in the menu are vegetarian?”She: [After the previous sentence being looped over 20 times]: “Yes, please sit; we will bring you vegetarian.”
On table I get something that looks very muttonish. After making some noise the chef came out of the kitchen; he understood some English and told I could get a replacement without paying again.
Me: “Which dish will you get for me?”He: “Vegetarian.”
Finally I got some cauliflower (in its purest vegetarian, read raw, form) and some fried (read oil-soaked) potatoes. I ate about 30% from my plate, then boiled MTR Poha (puffed rice) carried from home in the hot water obtained from the geyser-that-actually-worked-only-in-the-morning, and knew this was the end of trying out my luck at the hotel (apart from breakfast). On the remaining days I mostly sticked to the long menu of a Chinese restaurant next door (147 dishes, 3 vegetarian), an occasional Pizza from the chilly-walk place, and my MTR Pohas cooked with the morning-only geyser.
However, one night we had a fine dinner at an Indian restaurant (where I again found that Indians have a much stronger digestive system, think spices); I tried some tasty soups with two new friends on a beautiful evening; and on the last day finally tried the national dish (which happens to be vegetarian) — Fried cheese:
As indicated before, Prague is perhaps the city with the most convenient public transport: You can just install an app and charge it with your card for a day (not expensive at all), get a barcode that is your ticket, and travel as you want in any tram, bus, metro, or train. Moreover, the city is very-well covered — you perhaps don’t need to walk more than a few hundred meters anywhere — you will have nicely maintained, well-timed, clean-and-safe public transport available at the blink of an eye. I had listed down a large number of places to visit, and divided them into two days: Day 1 and Day 2, for the Saturday and the Sunday.
If you followed me in America, you know that the first thing on my list in a city that has a zoo, has to be a zoo. So Saturday began with visiting one of the best places hosting animals in the world: The Prague Zoo. Unlike the Zoo at Washington DC, at Prague you are welcomed with the star cast quite near to the entrance:
I spent nearly 3 hours at the zoo, walking about 8 kilometers inside, and ended with a team of as-tall-as-can-get Giraffes, and as-cute-as-can-get Penguins:
The next stop was The Old Town across Charles bridge (challenge: find the river in the lab-view above). Old Town has several attractions from the times Czechia was part of the Soviet Union, with several churches and castles at every turn. While the Prague Castle reminds one of Hogwarts, the Astronomical Clock attracts a huge crowd every hour for witnessing one of the many scientific marvels associated with the same (read more on Wikipedia):
Charles Bridge is a heritage on its own, with so many activities and picture-spots around that you can spend hours walking across and yet find something every time you cross! A beautiful view of the colorful city follows:
I finished traversing the Old Town by filling my bag at a shop full of candies (and forgetting the bag mid-way during my return journey)!
Having explored the crowded places the previous day, I decided to spend a solo Sunday climbing hills and exploring castles — both being rare opportunities in a vibrant city. The day was cold and hazy, but I walked and walked like crazy.
Vysehrad is an old castle in a bit far-off location, and should be traveled in broad day-light, is what I was told. Though the far-off part was true, I found the place full of people craving for silent time amidst the hustle and bustle of the cheerful city. You could sit there for hours with a book in hand, appreciating the rare greenery in the coldest of months.
The last I went was The Petrin Hill — reminiscent of the hikes I do around Mandi. I went up via a crowded rope-way and came down exploring solitary paths watching the city of hundred spires; as you descend, you realize every climb has its end, but the walk downhill doesn’t necessarily take you down.
If you ever visit Prague, do roam around the colorful streets, but take a moment walking up/down the Petrin Hill, sitting on that bench I couldn’t, and wondering “what to eat next” :-)
I returned back via Warsaw; the trip was prepended with a day’s stay with an about-to-be-engaged friend at New Delhi, and appended with a trip to Kolkata — a city where you drive ahead with both the legs on breaks (for preserving its classical past) — to attend the engagement of the same (more about my old-and-gold friends some time later!).
The series had promised an article every few weeks: it started swiftly, but has been going on rather slow. For me, the year 2020 has been full of remembering (read missing) the travels from 2019, and avid readers are in for many more write-ups. For now, an assurance is to have a few more articles than those promised in the intro A Traveling Year, one of them being exclusively on the rather long airport stays and flight journeys (of course with feedback on the food) I have had in the travel-rich year! So keep reading, and stay on…

I’m leaving the hotel bright and early and as I’m about to pack up I detected the quintessential bible that ever hotel ought to have (not!!!), only that here they had a rather unusual version of it.
I then stopped at a local bakery where I had the weakest coffee ever. I think I just don’t know how to (or rather what to) order. This actually begs the question: How much of a language is it courtesy to learn when visiting a country where one doesn’t speak the language? I understand zero Czech and here in the countryside the folks don’t tend to speak English. Maybe I should’ve tried German? After all, the city of Litoměřice — where I spent the night — was once part of the “Province of German Bohemia” and the town actually still has a German name: Leitmeritz. Well, I didn’t end up learning any Czech here at this bakery and instead made myself understandable with pointing at various items in the display case.
After breakfast, I hit the road. As I was passing the train station I saw a cool structure: a bike tower. I guess it’s for the folks commuting by train to work? This part of the country is certainly set up for cycling, with the Elbe-Labe Cycling Path probably contributing considerably to the local community. Later, I saw another cycle-friendly piece of infrastructure: a solar-powered charging station for e-bike.
Today’s first section of the route continued taking me along the river Elbe. As it was still rather early in the day, I saw a lot of fisherman sitting by the river and waiting for fish to latch on. There were so many of them and all of them men. I was wondering: How come women don’t do fishing? Seems like a relaxing activity. Maybe because they need to do the housework and tend to the kids while the men are frolicking their hobby?
On a similarly gender-related note, I noticed the below cycling path signs. Maybe someone would like to write a thesis on stereotypes in (modern) street signage? Questions that come to mind: Who still wears a hat like this? Do men really have the time to walk their daughters to school? Aren’t they too busy fishing? Discuss.
What I noticed since entering Czechia is that the Elbe here has several dams and so instead of a river, it often looks more like a lake. At one point today, I crossed one of these dams/locks and there were quite a few things to see.
Just like yesterday, I had the option to do a shortcut and arrive in Prague much faster: As rivers tend to meander, you can choose to go a straighter route. I decided to not be straight and instead follow the river path, which added a good 30km. I did this, because one of the highlights along the route was the river mouth where the Vltava (Moldau) and merges into the Labe (Elbe).
By the time I hit Mělník, I have to admit that I was starting to get tired. The next opportunity for food was not for another 25km and I was getting hungry. I stopped at a little convenience store to buy some fruits and water and that tied me over. The wind picked up and at some point I was cycling underneath a big dark cloud, which at eventually unloaded in a swift shower. I quickly found shelter underneath a tree, with view of a lovely castle.
Eventually, I arrived in an industrial-looking town and at the big roundabout I had a fundamental decision to make: Where should I buy my lunch from? The Lidl or the Tesco? Or, in other words: Supporting a German or British corporation? You can ask me next time you see me, which team I voted for. In any case, my fancy lunch consisted of two slices of pepperoni pizza and a sweet roll…all eaten at the back of the large supermarket building next to some vagabonds.
Then came the exciting part of the day and it literally elevated my heart rate: at some point my bike app showed me to cut through some forest area instead of following the river. Upon investigation, I saw that the stretch along the river was deemed “dangerous” by some cyclists. But the reckless person I am, I decided to choose the perilous option. Well, let’s just say this: I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, unless you have a mountain bike and like the thrill of cycling dangerously close to a cliff. To calm my nerves, I was humming the melody of Smetana’s Die Moldau, which was only fitting as I was cycling along its shores…
Since I’d sweated so much during this last stretch and since my destination for the day was in relatively close proximity, I decided to sit down at one of the very popular riverside kiosks for a glass of refreshing beer. What a great decision!
Eventually I arrived at the campsite and luckily they still had a space for me. The campground is just outside Prague city center and conveniently located next to a tram stop. After I’d set up camp, I took said mode of transport instead of my bike and ventured into the city.
Honestly, I was quite knackered and knew it wouldn’t be a night of partying. But, I wanted to enjoy a good meal and so I consulted Yelp and followed the recommendations for a restaurant called Vinohradský Parlament. It’s a beautiful restaurant and the waiter was fantastic. He recommended a hearty meal for me as I was telling him that I’d just cycled 100km and was rather famished. Their specialty are Czech dumplings (knedlíky) and this pillowy soft delicacy was perfect to soak up the juices that came with my beef roulade. For dessert, I had another kind of dumpling: this one stuffed with fresh blueberries! Yummy!
Afterwards, I was so tired that — after a brief wander around the city — I got back on the tram to my tent.

Since arriving in Eastern Europe, I’ve never experienced cloudy weather until now. At 7 in the morning, I dragged my tired body out for breakfast. Our accommodation offers an outdoor terrace, allowing us to enjoy the warm sunshine while savoring bread and morning orange juice.
It seems that Czech is as famous for its apples as it is for its dark beer. Everywhere we went, apples were being sold, and there were many bread and dishes containing apples. Although I didn’t crave any special taste, thinking about my growling stomach as I walked, I grabbed an apple and hurriedly set off for Prague again today.
Havel Market & Trdelník
We went straight to the traditional market in Prague that we had been eager to visit, Havel Market. Unfortunately, there were a few things that left us slightly disappointed:

Prague seemed like the wisest choice for my next destination, given they were still on the Koruna (information I acquired from the ladies in Paris). They had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
I didn’t know much about Prague, other than that my friend, Kevin, told me I needed to go because “you can get wasted there for 5 bucks.” That was enough for me. Kevin always knows what he’s talking about. The only problem was the overnight, 14-hour train ride. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to romp. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost 8 Euros/night (about $10 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be two and a half hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand clocks? What the fuck are we doing here? Come on.
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were burned and shit on. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was me and a few other people, who I assume also couldn’t tell time.
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple more baguettes and a bunch of bananas (I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them), to supplement the Adderall I was going to take once the ride began. There’s nothing like Adderall when you need to kill 14 hours. Shit, you could stare at a clock for the entire time and still enjoy it. At least that’s how the drug made me feel.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, laying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
“I’ll be right back,” I told them.
I went to the bar cart and asked for four cups. Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they receive their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all loose as geese. We took turns telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed. Words, as usual, were unnecessary.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; 4 guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dark thoughts. Anything to avoid thinking about my dad.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train. Or maybe it was the second transfer I screwed up; I can’t remember. Either way, I ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like I was in Prague, the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of smoking and walking around, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel”. They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was? Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis in it and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. Without their kindness, I would have had to spend another night on a train station floor. I wanted to thank them, to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me, in what I assumed was Czech, for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics (only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad). When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Never comment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in a foreign country at two in the morning. It’s best to just listen and agree, then form your opinions later.
When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon. It was my grandfather’s name, and he was a miserable, racist old bastard. One time he told me he didn’t want my Indian friend, Naveen, over at the house because he, “wreaked of curry.” I used to pray for him to die. And when he did, I helped myself to his collection of Member’s Only jackets.
Irish Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: “How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.”
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday”. The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX.
She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was beautiful, but she didn’t flash it often. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. I can always spot a fellow speed freak. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a walk until the bars opened. For better or worse, I was now a part of a crew.
I slept like a drunken baby until noon the next day. When I came down to the common area, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. I was impressed, even turned on. She was motherly as well, a quality that inherently attracts me. I appreciated the way she made sure everyone was fed, before eating herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Hostel mom. All hostels had one, but like in life, many of them stink.
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. Its so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class American people wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had the whole two floor almost all to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happens in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were on a date.
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: Johnny… The umpire has the final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way there. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick. “Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular. Some might not have liked it, but I sure did. It reminded me of a Day’s Inn conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar, that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer. When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We up pulled seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked them over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on we were all best friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid, onto the table. I know moonshine when I see it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could stand. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others laughed. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech radio music, and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling.
Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that, and we stumbled home.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching. Every time we got close, he would scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar. We drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day, at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So, why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: I’m running.
Caroline: From what?
Me: Myself. Since my dad died, I feel like I can’t stop. If I do, I’ll have time to think. And I don’t want to think.
Caroline. I understand.
Me: Why are you here?
Caroline: Same reason, really. My younger brother died last year. When I’m home in Perth, I can’t get him out of my mind. He died in a car accident, along with our dogs.
Me: That’s terrible.
Caroline: How about we run together?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I heard Bratislava was nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t. Tomorrow we can take a bus. It’s a short ride.
By the time I got up the next morning, Simon had already weaseled his way into our plans. During breakfast, Caroline gave me a look as if to apologize. I couldn’t be upset though; Simon was a persistent one, I would have given in too.
Simon: Let me get some more of that speed. That was good shit.
Me: Goddamn you, Simon.
I gave him the 10mg pill, which he took immediately, in front of everyone.
Simon: Hey Johnny, we’re going to get pissed today, aren’t we?
Me: You just watch yourself, Ok? And please, don’t open any more beers with your mouth. It makes me sick.
It was only a 2-hour ride from Prague to Bratislava, but that didn’t deter Simon from bringing along a whole case of beer. He bought it though, and carried it, so I didn’t complain. Plus, it was nice to get some reciprocation after getting him high with my good Amsterdam weed for the past two days. The beer was the only luggage he took. I didn’t ask if he had more clothes, or any belongings at all, but I was curious. Best not to ask questions you don’t want the answers to.
He was 2 beers deep before we even boarded. With each one, he’d covertly pop the cap off then put it back on, before pretending to open it with his teeth, giving me a childish look in the process. At that point I’d stopped caring, but he wouldn’t let it go. He was an instigator that way. I’ve never understood why some people show affection by teasing. You can only pull off teasing if you’re funny and have tact. Otherwise, you just sound like an annoying asshole. Timing is everything.
Caroline and I sat next to each other, while Simon sat behind us. He smelled like he hadn’t showered in a week, and he probably hadn’t. When the metal chains on his leather jacket clanged against the poor old woman sitting beside him, she clutched her bag and turned towards the window. I felt terrible for her, having to sit next to a drunken stink bomb like that for 2 hours. He was disgusting.
Speaking of disgusting… I was always embarrassed when my dad and I went out in public together. He was impossible not to stare at because of how fat and unkempt he was. And I was his son, so I got stares too. Food is the worst drug in that way. Most addictions aren’t noticeable to the naked eye, but with food, there’s no way to hide it, unless you purge. My mom always told me that everyone is too caught up in their own lives to notice other people’s insecurities, but I never believed her. I knew they were looking, wondering how a child like me could come from a man like that. I could feel their indictments of him as a father; I could feel their pity. I felt it all. Those feelings have never left me, even long after his death. I can still feel those eyeballs on me.
It was a peaceful first hour. Caroline and I read from our books while knocking knees. The unspoken intimacy was lovely. She was on her second read of a Virginia Woolf book I can’t remember the name of, just like I was on my second read of my Hunter Thompson book. We both sipped our beers and enjoyed the nice cross breeze wisping through the bus. The sun was out, and we were in just the right place at just the right time.
With only about 15 minutes left in the ride, I reached back to grab another beer from the box on Simon’s lap. That’s when I saw the flashing lights behind us. It was a police van, and it was rapidly approaching. When it got closer it became clear that we were the ones being pulled over.
Me: Uh, what the fuck is going on?”
Simon: It’s usually just standard shite. Don’t worry.
Me: Usually?!
Several police officers boarded the bus, all of whom were holding automatic rifles and looking very serious. I swear, in Europe everyone with even a modicum of authority gets a machine gun. They went around checking passports. When they got to me, I was terrified. My bag and pockets were filled with weed, hash, and a bunch of loose Adderall pills. Also, I was American. Being an American in Europe is almost as bad as being black in America. Boy, being black in Europe must be double awful.
I handed the cop my passport, and instead of handing it back, he put it in his pocket and escorted me off the bus. I was the only one singled out. Everyone else just sat comfortably, drinking their beers. The jig was finally up, and my worst nightmare was coming true. “If this is what happens in the movie Hostel, I’m going to kill Caroline for not warning me,” I thought to myself.
He asked me a bunch of questions that I obviously didn’t understand, while repeatedly checking my passport and shaking his head from side to side. It was like I was being questioned by a squirrel. I had no clue what he wanted from me or how I could appease him. I tried to look like an upstanding gentleman by buttoning up my cardigan and straightening my posture, but it didn’t seem to be working. He saw right through me.
I could see Simon in the window of the bus. He was giving me the international sign for throat-slashing. I wasn’t sure if he was implying that I should kill myself to avoid Slovakian prison, or if he was telling me I should find a way to slit the officer’s throat and escape. Probably the latter, knowing him. Caroline too had come to the window. I could see the concern on her face. If she was scared, I knew I was in trouble.
They had me out on the side of the road for ten agonizing minutes while they talked on their radios. The bus driver came out at one point to ask what the holdup was, and they swiftly sent him back on the bus. Now, everyone was concerned. I got Caroline’s attention through the window.
Me: Caroline, grab a pen… My name is Sam Rosenberg, NOT John McEnroe. My mom’s name is Audrey. She lives in Northbrook, Illinois. Please tell her —
Then, it all ended, just like that. No bag check, no pat down, no nothing. They just sent me on my not so merry way, with my passport. The bus driver gave me a snide look, like I’d messed up his schedule, but I didn’t care. I’d dodged another bullet. Simon opened a beer with his teeth and handed it to me.
Simon: This deserves a celebration.
Our hostel wasn’t the most fashionable, but it was cheap, and right downtown. The room fit 8 people. It was the three of us and 5 Italian guys who were all clearly friends. When we got to the room, they were eating spaghetti with their shirts off. It was wildly apropos. When they offered us each a bowl, Caroline and I politely declined. Simon, on the other hand, scarfed one down in less than a minute.
Simon: You call this pasta? It’s shite, mate. Sorry to tell you.
They didn’t understand.
Italian Guy: Si, pasta. Prego, prego.
Me: Prego?
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Caroline: (understanding the double entendre) Not the brand, Sam.
Simon: Ahem, his name is Johnny.
Caroline: It means “you’re welcome.”
Me: Ah, grazie.
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Right down the street from our hostel was a bar called The Dubliner. It looked exactly like you’d expect it to look. There’s no need to even describe it. Irish bars are perfect that way, you always get what you expect, regardless of the country you’re in. The food and liquor are the same, as is the décor. They are, if nothing else, reliable. And reliability is everything.
Caroline and I sat at a table together, drinking Guinness, while Simon roamed around the bar swilling Jameson and accosting random strangers. “I’m here with John McEnroe!” he’d tell anyone who’d listen. He was blacked out. 12 beers in 2 hours will do that to you.
Simon got punched in the face and thrown out within an hour. I didn’t see it but apparently, he spit in some guy’s face after being called a cunt. Then thee guy decked him with a single punch. As someone who used the word so often, I’d expect Simon to be less sensitive to being called one himself. Caroline and I were tossed too because we came with him. He tried fighting every single person on the way out, but Caroline and I just stood there and watched. There was no way I was fighting on his behalf. The last time I did that was in 4th grade when a friend got jumped for using a racial slur. I have regretted it ever since and still think of the guy as a racist piece of shit.
When the hullabaloo concluded, Simon’s face was bloodied, but he still wanted to drink.
Me: You need to go back to the hostel. They won’t let you into a bar with blood all over your face and shirt. That’s surely a universal rule.
Simon: Fuck that. When someone in Dublin gets punched in the face, the bar buys them drinks.
Me: We are not in Dublin.
Caroline: Sam and I are going to eat. You can’t come. You need to rest.
To my amazement, Simon heeded her advice and stumbled back to the hostel to crash. I felt sorry for the Italians because I knew he’d finish their spaghetti and/or try to fight them. At least it was five against one, and Simon could hardly stand, so I wasn’t too worried about them.
Caroline and I set out to find the nicest restaurant we could. We’d both been skimping on money for weeks and finally wanted to splurge now that we were amongst good company. We walked around for half an hour holding hands, chatting about food. Caroline told me she used to cook for her late brother, “Damby,” as she called him (because she couldn’t say “Danny” when she was little). She’d make him minced meat pies on Sundays after church. They were his favorite, and he’d eat them inside-out, saving the crust for last (I do the same). The recipe came from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother before her.
I told her about my Bubbie, and the fried latkes she’d make for me after school. I always thought the jelly would cool them down faster, but it really just cooled the exterior, lulling me into a burnt mouth. I never learned my lesson. We traded food story after food story, our faces lit up, until we had none left.
Food is the easiest way to make bonds, Bourdain taught me that, and I’ve always found it to be true. We all eat.
Downtown Bratislava was way more beautiful than I’d expected. The streets were cobblestone, but the buildings were modern; a dichotomy that somehow worked. It perfectly combined the old world with the new. And the place oozed romanticism. It was like a poem come to life. Everything Disneyland claims to be, Bratislava actually was. If you’re proposing to someone, I suggest doing it there. You will no doubt get a “yes.”
We found a white-tablecloth, French restaurant to dine in. They didn’t seem to care about our casual attire even though the place was fancy, which impressed me. Everyone who can afford a meal should be accommodated, regardless of their attire. Miss me with that classist shit. Before ordering we decided we’d share so we could try more dishes. We got escargot to start. Always start with escargot if they have it. Then we had an omelet, followed by a quiche. For our main courses we shared duck confit and beef bourguignon. Everything was insanely good, like eyes rolling back and moaning good. The price didn’t matter, though they were on the Krona too, so it only came out to what amounted to $40 USD.
We were enveloped in each other that night. The vibes were electric. We flirted and teased, properly, on the walk back. We were about to enter the hostel, when Caroline grabbed my arm.
Caroline: Do you have a girlfriend?
Me: No. Do you have a boyfriend?
Caroline: No.
I knew an opportunity when I saw one, so I leaned in and gave her a kiss.
Caroline: (Pulling away) Just kidding, I do.
Me: What?!
Caroline: Haha, you should see your face.
Me: Why did you do that?
Caroline: To fuck with you.
Me: I don’t appreciate that.
Caroline: (mockingly) I’m Sam, and I don’t appreciate jokes even though I was a comedian. Shut up and kiss me again, you sensitive man you.
I kissed her again, this time pulling her close.
Me: Whoa, that was awesome. Let’s do that more.
I usually say some very awkward shit during and after moments of passion. It’s like the side effect I get from a boner is Tourette’s. I’ve been known to say “thank you” after I cum. It’s not something I’m proud of.
Caroline: I have an idea… How about we go somewhere else, without Simon, and pretend to be a couple? Like, just for a few days. We can go our separate ways after that.
Me: I dig that. But how are we going to get rid of Simon?
Caroline: Leave that up to me.
We made out for a few more minutes before going upstairs. Simon was still passed out, and the Italian guys weren’t back yet, so we laid in my bunk and dry humped quietly for a little while. Part of me couldn’t believe I was hooking up with such an awesome chick, but the other part wished it was Meghan. I kept my mouth shut, as to not ruin our moment, but I felt guilty, like I was using her. Before going to bed, I wrote in my journal:
Why are you like this? Who are you trying to spare in this situation? You’re not even dating Meghan, and Caroline REALLY likes you. You don’t have to be in love with her to have some fun. I mean, you just had sex with a prostitute, how is this worse than that? Ignore your silly morals for once and take a chance. Put yourself out there. Meghan would want you to.
It was easier to ditch Simon than we’d expected because I’m pretty sure he had a concussion. I tried to wake him up a few times, because I knew you weren’t supposed to sleep in that situation, but he kept telling me to fuck off. Caroline finally had enough.
Caroline: Simon, Sam and I are leaving. We will say a prayer for you. Drink water and don’t look directly into bright lights for a few days.
Simon: You cunts. You’re going to leave me here, like this? Sam, I need more speed.
Me: No. And it’s Mr. McEnroe to you.
Caroline pulled me out of the room by my arm before we could hear any more of his pleading. I was insulted by everything Simon did, but that demand infuriated me. I wanted to go back in there and smother him with a pillow. I guess that’s what I get for always seeing the best in people, and for sharing my drugs. Friends like these, eh dude?
Caroline and I went right to the train stop after buying some candy for the trip. She loved the sour stuff. The sourer, the better. In my experience, sweet people like sour candy, and sour people like sweet candy. I’ve ran the numbers, trust me. We didn’t know where to go, so we looked at a map on the wall.
Me: So where to ma’am?
Caroline: Why don’t you just close your eyes and point?
Without waiting for my response, she got behind me and covered my eyes. Then, she spun me around a few times, before placing me back in front of the map. I pointed to a spot.
Caroline: I hear Vienna is nice.

Hey there, fellow wanderers!
Picture this: a slightly panicked introvert standing in the middle of Old Town Square at 6 AM, clutching a lukewarm coffee and wondering what on earth she’s doing in Prague all by herself. That was me, three years ago — more anxiety than passport stamps, about to embark on what would become the most life-changing week ever.
Spoiler alert: I didn’t just fall in love with Prague’s fairy-tale architecture and ridiculously good goulash (seriously, the food is incredible!). I discovered a version of myself I never knew existed — the one who could navigate cobblestone streets confidently, eat dinner alone without checking her phone every five seconds, and actually enjoy her own company.
And honestly? I’m pretty sure you will too.
After four years of guiding tourists around Turkey’s stunning coastlines, I thought I had this whole travel thing figured out. I knew how to handle cranky tourists, navigate crowds without losing anyone, and make sure everyone felt safe and entertained. I was the person with all the answers, the backup plans, the emergency snacks.
But here’s the kicker — I’d never actually traveled just for me. Wild, right?
Every trip was about managing other people’s experiences, schedules, and expectations. I was always “on,” always responsible for someone else’s good time. Sound familiar?
So when I finally booked that solo trip to Prague, I honestly had no clue what I was getting myself into. My friends thought I was either incredibly brave or slightly unhinged (jury’s still out on that one). My family worried I’d spend the whole week talking to pigeons and eating sad hotel room crackers.
Oh boy, was I wrong about everything.
The real transformation didn’t happen at the famous Prague Castle or on that Instagram-perfect Charles Bridge everyone raves about. Nope. It happened on day three, in this tiny café tucked away in Lesser Town, where I spent two glorious hours reading a book, sipping what might have been the best coffee of my life, and realizing something mind-blowing:
I was genuinely enjoying my own company for the first time in… well, maybe ever.
Okay, let me be completely honest with you — Prague totally spoiled me for other cities. It’s like the universe took notes on what anxious introverts need and designed the perfect solo travel playground.
Here’s why Prague works so beautifully for us nervous first-timers:
It’s Ridiculously Safe (Even for Overthinkers Like Me)
I walked everywhere. Day, night, through winding medieval streets that looked straight out of a fairy tale. The scariest thing that happened? Getting mildly turned around near Wenceslas Square (which, fun fact, isn’t actually a square but more like a really long street — Prague loves keeping you on your toes!).
The city center is compact, well-lit, and there are always people around. Plus, Czech people are generally pretty reserved and respectful, which means you won’t deal with aggressive street harassment or pushy vendors trying to sell you overpriced “authentic” souvenirs every five minutes.
Basically, Prague lets you dip your toes into solo travel without throwing you into the deep end.
Your Wallet Will Actually Love You
One of my biggest solo travel fears was accidentally bankrupting myself on overpriced tourist food. You know that panic when you realize you just paid €25 for a sad sandwich near the Eiffel Tower? Yeah, Prague laughs at that nonsense.
I ate like an absolute queen for the price of a mediocre airport meal back home. Traditional Czech meals with beer (yes, beer!) often cost less than a single appetizer in most major European cities. This means you can actually enjoy yourself without constantly calculating exchange rates and having mini panic attacks about your credit card bill.
It’s Like Living Inside a Disney Movie (But Real)
I’m not being dramatic when I say Prague looks like someone took every fairy-tale castle, medieval fantasy, and romantic European dream and smooshed them together into one impossibly beautiful city. Walking through the streets genuinely feels like you’ve stepped into a storybook.
Which is perfect when you’re writing your own adventure story, right?
Day 1: Arrival and the Classic “What Have I Done?” Moment
I checked into my adorable little hotel in New Town (pro tip: stay somewhere central but not smack in the middle of tourist chaos), dumped my overpacked suitcase, and immediately felt that familiar flutter of anxiety.
You know the feeling — that voice in your head going, “Congratulations, you’ve officially made a terrible decision. Enjoy eating alone for a week, weirdo.”
Instead of hiding in my room scrolling social media like my introvert brain suggested, I forced myself to take a gentle walk toward the Powder Gate and Municipal House. The architecture literally stopped me in my tracks. I stood there for a solid ten minutes just gawking at all the intricate details on the Municipal House facade like some kind of architectural tourist (which I totally was).
That evening, I found this cozy restaurant with bar seating — my secret weapon for solo dining — and had my first taste of svíčková. I was super skeptical about meat drowning in cream sauce (it sounds questionable, right?), but oh my goodness, it was absolutely incredible.
The elderly Czech woman sitting next to me smiled and nodded approvingly when I practically licked my plate clean. My first genuine human connection of the trip, and it was over mutual appreciation of comfort food. Perfect.
Day 2: Playing Tourist (But Flying Solo Style)
Old Town Square was everything I’d drooled over in Instagram photos and somehow even more magical in person. The famous Astronomical Clock show happens every hour, and yes, it’s honestly a bit underwhelming (sorry, Prague tourism board!), but there’s something genuinely special about being part of that collective moment with strangers from around the world.
The real treasure was the Church of Our Lady Before Týn with its dramatic Gothic spires that look like something straight out of a Tim Burton movie. I found a nearby café, ordered another incredible coffee (Prague’s coffee game is seriously underrated), and spent an hour sketching the towers in my travel journal while people-watching.
This became my daily ritual — finding quiet spots to observe and actually process what I was seeing instead of just snapping photos and moving on.
The Jewish Quarter hit me right in the feels in ways I hadn’t expected. The weight of history, the stunning beauty of the Spanish Synagogue with its intricate Moorish design, the sobering reality of the Old Jewish Cemetery — it reminded me why solo travel can be so powerful. You can take all the time you need to really feel and process heavy experiences without worrying about someone else’s comfort level or schedule.
Day 3: The Charles Bridge Revelation (AKA My “I Can Do This” Moment)
Here’s where things got interesting. I dragged my not-a-morning-person self out of bed at sunrise (definitely not easy!) to experience Charles Bridge without the usual crowds of selfie-stick wielding tourists.
Standing there in the golden morning light, with just a few dedicated joggers and adorable dog walkers for company, I had what I can only describe as a moment of pure, unexpected contentment.
I wasn’t frantically taking selfies or checking how many likes my last post got. I was just… there. Present. Enjoying the view and my own thoughts without any distractions or obligations.
It sounds almost too simple, but when you’re used to constantly managing other people’s experiences or being “on” all the time, these moments of genuine solitude feel absolutely revolutionary.
Lesser Town became my favorite neighborhood that day. It’s like stepping through a portal into the past, with narrow cobblestone streets (wear good shoes, trust me!) and baroque buildings painted in the most gorgeous soft pastels.
I stumbled upon the John Lennon Wall, completely covered in colorful graffiti and Beatles lyrics, and learned from a friendly local that it had been a symbol of peace and freedom during Communist times. These unexpected mini-history lessons happen constantly when you’re traveling solo — you actually have time to read the plaques, strike up random conversations, and really absorb the stories instead of rushing to the next photo op.
Day 4: Castle Conquering and Confidence Building
Prague Castle day meant serious uphill walking (note to past self: ALWAYS pack your most comfortable walking shoes!). The castle complex is absolutely massive — we’re talking small-city-on-a-hill massive. St. Vitus Cathedral made me actually gasp out loud with its soaring Gothic arches and stained glass windows that look like giant jewels.
But honestly? The real highlight was Golden Lane, this absolutely charming street of tiny, colorful houses where castle guards and craftspeople used to live. I spent almost an hour exploring each miniature dwelling, imagining the daily lives of people who once called these dollhouse-sized homes their own.
The confidence boost of navigating this enormous complex completely by myself — reading maps, making decisions about what to see and what to skip based purely on my own interests — felt like a masterclass in trusting my own judgment.
Day 5: Hidden Gems and Personal Discoveries
Vyšehrad Fortress became my absolute favorite discovery. It’s way less crowded than Prague Castle but equally stunning, with incredible views over the Vltava River and the city spread out below like a living postcard.
The peaceful cemetery where famous Czech artists and writers are buried became my spot for quiet reflection. I know that sounds morbid, but there was something deeply moving about walking among the elaborate tombstones and thinking about all the creative souls who once called Prague home.
I packed a little picnic lunch (cheese, bread, and local fruit from a market) and spent hours just sitting on the fortress walls, watching boats drift down the river and thinking about my life back home. These moments of pure solitude were becoming addictive in the absolute best way.
Day 6: Confidence in Full Bloom
By this point, I was navigating Prague’s winding streets like I’d lived there for months. I’d found my favorite café (Café Louvre, where Einstein apparently used to hang out — how cool is that?), discovered hidden gardens perfect for morning reading sessions, and even ventured into neighborhoods completely outside the tourist bubble.
The Museum of Alchemists and Magicians was wonderfully weird and perfectly Prague — quirky, mysterious, and slightly magical. That evening, I treated myself to dinner at this fancy restaurant I would never have chosen if I were worried about accommodating someone else’s preferences or budget.
Eating alone at a white tablecloth establishment felt like such a grown-up, confident thing to do. The waiter was lovely, recommending wine pairings and chatting about his favorite Prague neighborhoods. Another reminder that most people are genuinely kind when you’re open to connection.
Day 7: Saying Goodbye to My Transformed Self
My last morning, I made one final pilgrimage to Charles Bridge for sunrise. This time, I wasn’t nervous or uncertain about being alone. I was simply a woman who had spent a week getting to know herself in one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
The difference in my confidence from day one to day seven was honestly shocking. I’d gone from anxious and uncertain to genuinely excited about solo adventures.
Solo Doesn’t Equal Lonely (Revolutionary Concept, I Know)
This was my biggest fear going in and my most surprising revelation coming out. I had rich, meaningful experiences every single day. Sometimes through brief but lovely interactions with locals or fellow travelers, but mostly through rediscovering the genuine joy of my own company.
I’d somehow lost that in years of constantly accommodating other people’s needs, schedules, and preferences. Prague gave it back to me.
You’re Way More Capable Than Your Anxiety Wants You to Believe
Every small decision — which charming street to wander down, where to grab lunch, how to spend an unexpected free afternoon — built my confidence muscle. By the end of the week, I was making quick, intuitive choices and trusting my instincts in ways that genuinely surprised me.
That confidence didn’t magically disappear when I got home. It showed up in work meetings, personal relationships, and daily decision-making in ways I never expected.
Slow Travel is the Secret Sauce
Without anyone else’s agenda to consider, I could linger in places that spoke to my soul and skip things that didn’t interest me. I spent an entire afternoon in the peaceful Franciscan Garden just because it felt right. I revisited my favorite café three times because the coffee was perfect and the atmosphere made me genuinely happy.
No rushing, no compromising, no “we should probably see this because it’s famous.” Just pure, authentic exploration based on what actually interested me.
Where to Stay for Maximum Comfort and Confidence
Old Town is super convenient but touristy and expensive (and honestly kind of overwhelming). I absolutely loved New Town — central enough to walk everywhere but with more authentic local flavor and much better prices.
Vinohrady is perfect if you want to feel like a temporary Prague resident, with incredible cafés and tree-lined streets that feel genuinely residential.
Pro tip: Look for places with 24-hour reception and stellar reviews from other solo female travelers. I always read reviews specifically mentioning solo travel experiences — they’re gold mines of practical information.
The Art of Solo Dining (It’s Way Easier Than Your Brain Thinks)
Prague’s café culture is absolutely perfect for solo travelers. Look for places with bar seating or communal tables where eating alone feels natural and intentional rather than awkward.
Traditional beer halls and pubs are surprisingly solo-friendly too — there’s something about the casual, communal atmosphere that makes dining alone feel completely normal. Plus, locals often eat alone, so you definitely won’t stand out.
My foolproof strategy: always carry a book or journal. It gives you something to do with your hands and makes the whole experience feel purposeful rather than like you’re waiting for someone who’s running late.
Getting Around Like You Own the Place
Prague’s public transport is excellent and super safe, but honestly, you can walk to most major attractions from the city center. The medieval layout can be confusing (I got turned around more times than I care to admit), but that’s part of the charm.
The tram system runs frequently even late at night, and it’s efficient and reliable. Get a multi-day transport pass for convenience, and always use official taxis with yellow roof lights and clear company logos.
Download offline maps before you go — Prague’s winding streets can be tricky, and you don’t want to drain your phone battery when you need GPS most.
Safety Tips That Actually Matter (Not the Scary Stuff)
Keep your bag zipped and in front of you in crowded tourist areas — pickpockets definitely target distracted visitors around major attractions like Old Town Square and Charles Bridge. Save your accommodation’s address in your phone and grab one of their business cards to keep in your wallet.
Most importantly: trust your instincts. If something feels off, remove yourself from the situation. But honestly? The biggest safety threat in Prague is falling so hard for the city that you start researching apartment rental prices (definitely guilty as charged).
Here’s what nobody tells you about solo travel: it’s not really about the destination at all. Prague was absolutely incredible, but the real journey was completely internal.
I learned to trust my judgment, genuinely enjoy my own company, and make decisions based on what I actually wanted rather than what I thought I should want or what would make other people happy.
This newfound confidence didn’t conveniently stay in Prague when I flew home. It followed me into job interviews, personal relationships, family dynamics, and daily decision-making. It fundamentally changed how I approach challenges and how I see myself in the world.
If you’re reading this and feeling that familiar flutter of excitement mixed with absolute terror, that’s your sign. That’s exactly how I felt three years ago, standing in my kitchen with a Prague guidebook, wondering if I was actually brave enough to book the trip.
Here’s the truth: I wasn’t particularly brave. I was just curious enough to feel the fear and explore anyway.
Prague is waiting for you right now. Not just the city with its stunning architecture, incredible food, and fairy-tale streets, but the version of yourself you’ll discover wandering those ancient cobblestones. The woman who can confidently navigate foreign cities, make decisions based on her own desires, and genuinely enjoy her own amazing company.
Your Prague itinerary for solo female travelers isn’t just another vacation plan — it’s an invitation to meet the most interesting person you’ll ever travel with: yourself.
So pack your curiosity, leave those doubts at home, and get ready for the most important conversation of your life. Prague is an excellent listener, and I have a feeling you might be surprised by what you discover you have to say.
Ready to start planning your own transformation? Your solo Prague adventure is just one brave click away. Trust me, your future self will thank you for being curious enough to take that first step.

Most people know Prague for its cheap beer and beautiful bridges, but did you know that the city has a blossoming art gallery scene, too?
Prague truly has something for everyone. Are you a fan of historical art? What about contemporary art? The city has it all — if you know where to look. But even if you don’t, don’t worry. That’s what this guide is for, after all!
Here’s a list of some of the best must-see galleries in Prague you can’t miss.
Fun fact: Prague’s National Gallery is one of the largest art museums in Central Europe. It has several buildings across the city. Honestly, if you want to see all of it, you might want to extend your trip by a couple of days! That’s how much art there is for you to admire.
Whether you’re interested in the old masters, Czech modernism, or international contemporary exhibitions, this gallery needs to be on your travel itinerary.
It’s a must-see for anyone who’s looking for a deep dive into Czech and European art.
I’ll admit — this one is a personal favorite of mine. There’s no better way to spend the afternoon in Prague than visiting DOX and seeing whatever exhibition they currently have on. They never miss!
DOX Centre for Contemporary Art is Prague’s leading modern art space. Here, you can expect thought-provoking exhibitions, modern architecture, and a permanent rooftop airship installation with some cozy beanbags inside.
It’s located in the Holešovice district, which is full of artistic cafés, beautiful plant stores, and small independent shops that you can get lost in. Perfect for an artsy day out!
This Prague art gallery is a must-see for contemporary art lovers.
Kampa Museum is all about modern European art. They especially spotlight Czech and Central European artists. Here, you can see the works of František Kupka and Otto Gutfreund, as well as other rotating exhibits.
This beautiful gallery also has an exciting location — you can find it on Kampa Island by the Vltava River. That’s right — it’s on an actual island. In the middle of mainland Europe!
If you’re looking for a unique setting with stunning views, this is the one for you.
MeetFactory is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. This contemporary gallery and artist residency was founded by David Černý, a famous Czech artist who also designed the famous Rotating Head of Franz Kafka.
MeetFactory is all about avant-garde exhibitions, live performances, and experimental installations. It’s perfect for edgier travelers who want to see something different.
If you’re interested in experiencing Prague’s alternative art scene, you really shouldn’t miss this one!
Schwarzenberg Palace is technically part of the National Gallery, but it definitely deserves its own spot on this list. It’s a beautiful place, which makes sense. After all, it’s actually a Baroque palace that was only later turned into an art gallery. Its highlights include Czech Baroque and Renaissance paintings and sculptures.
For its historical setting showcasing classic masterpieces, of course. Also, it’s near Prague Castle, another popular tourist destination — why not do a little 2-in-1?
Leica Art Gallery in Prague is a must-visit spot for photography lovers. It specializes in fine art photography by both Czech and international photographers. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, add this one to your itinerary. And don’t forget to check out the Leica camera store, too!
This one is a must for photography enthusiasts.
Last but not least, we have the Rudolfinum Gallery, which is a historic concert hall with a contemporary art gallery. It’s located by the Vltava River, near the Old Town, meaning that just walking there will take your breath away.
The Rudolfinum Gallery offers exhibitions of modern and contemporary art, despite how old and majestic it may look from the outside.
This gallery combines fine art with one of Prague’s most beautiful buildings. It also has a fun name. The Rudolfinum. Try not to think about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer while putting that name into Google Maps. I dare you.
The Rudolfinum is a gorgeous building, but it’s not the only one. Prague is a beautiful city with many views worth taking in. This is why river cruises are so popular here. If you want to see more of the city but don’t have a ton of time to walk everywhere, a cruise is the perfect solution.
You can try this Panoramic Vltava River Cruise by Get Your Guide, which will take you around Prague’s most famous landmarks, including Kampa Island, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and more.
Disclaimer: The above link is an affiliate link. If you choose to go on the cruise, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. No pressure, though!
In case it wasn’t obvious, Prague’s art scene is super diverse. Whether you’re a modern art enthusiast or a lover of the classics, you won’t be disappointed by checking out these gorgeous galleries. So, don’t forget to add them to your travel plans.

This magical city of Prague! No other place can leave such a living memory. No other city looks at its visitors with such wonderful eyes. Prague is the city that can make you fall in love with it!
In this article, we are going to give you 5 most popular tourist tips for curious travelers. Slowly carrying out all the points and enjoying your trip, you will get the most complete impression of this wonderful city and its traditions.
Let’s start our unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague!
1. Walk along the Charles Bridge
Prague’s oldest bridge is built of sandstone blocks, flanked at each end by fortified towers (Lesser Town Bridge Towers, Old Town Bridge Tower). From 1683 to 1928, thirty statues of saints were carved to decorate the bridge, the most famous of which is the statue of St John of Nepomuk.
From the bridge, you will have amazing views over many Prague’s medieval towers, churches, and palaces. The view towards Lesser Town, dominated by the Prague Castle complex, is very picturesque.
The best time to visit Charles Bridge is early in the morning or at night when it is not crowded. You can climb two towers standing on both ends of the Bridge for a magnificent view of Prague and the bridge from above.
You can get to the Charles Bridge when taking the tram number 12, 20, 22 or 23, getting off at station Malostranse Namesti.
The Charles Bridge over the Vltava River is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Prague. Its towers and sculptures are worth to be seen!
2. Admire the architecture of Old Town Square and watch a unique Astronomical Clock performance
Wander through the Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí), where the true heart of Prague beats!
The elegant tower of the Old Town Hall with the world famous Astronomical Clock, the monumental Church of St. Nicholas and countless colorful houses of many styles give this place a unique atmosphere, which will mesmerize you if you decide to take a look at its charm.
Not avoiding a crowd of tourists, watch a performance on an Astronomical Clock at the Old Town Hall, called “The Apostle Parade”. Its main function was to depict the movement of the Sun and the Moon; showing the time was merely a secondary element. The Apostle figures became part of the clock in the middle of the 16th century.
Very much has been written about the performance itself, but nothing will convey that atmosphere of mystery and admiration that reigns over the square during this performance. For a greater impression during the presentation, be sure to remember that the clock was built in the 15th century and has not undergone any tangible changes since that time.
The Apostle parade can be seen on the Prague Astronomical Clock every hour on the hour from 9 a.m. till 11 p.m. However, it is better to watch it in the morning, when there are relatively few people on the square. To take the most advantageous place, come to the clock 15 minutes beforehand.
While walking along the historical center, try famous Czech trdelnik, a kind of spit cake, made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick and topped with sugar and walnuts. Here you can eat a fried sausage and drink Czech beer.
All this must be done by sitting on a free bench and enjoying the surrounding pictures. In winter, the beer can be replaced with hot mulled wine or grog.
3. Enjoy a classic performance in Prague National Theatre
The National Theatre in Prague belongs to the most important Czech cultural institutions with a rich artistic tradition. Today the National Theatre consists of three artistic ensembles — opera, ballet, and drama. Operas are sung mostly in Italian and are accompanied by both Czech and English subtitles.
Visit Giuseppe Verdi´s La Traviata and Aida, Camille Saint-Saens´ Samson and Dalila, or very popular Georges Bizet´s Carmen. If you want to see something by Czech authors, there is Bedrich Smetana´s Hubicka (The Kiss), Tajemstvi (The Secret), and famous Rusalka.
Another scene of the National Theater is the Estates Theater. On this stage, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart´s La Clemenza di Tito, Don Giovanni, La Nozze di Figaro, and The Magic Flute are staged.
If you prefer the Ballet, you can visit Adolphe Charles Adam´s Giselle or project Solo Pro tri (Solo for three).
Both of the buildings are very nice, performances are well prepared, done by the best Czech and world dancers and singers, prepared by great directors and choreographers. So if you like Opera or Ballet, it is worth to visit the National Theatre, as it can be a great cultural experience, and a way how to spend a pleasant evening in Prague.
Do you want to visit the smallest street in Prague and go inside these tiny houses?
4. Golden Lane or Zlatá ulička!
On the eastern side of the Prague Castle, not far from St. George’s Basilica, there is an unusual street called Zlatá ulička. It is considered a symbol of Prague, its historical heritage.
Colored facades of tiny houses emerge on the cobblestone pavement. Sixteen old buildings have survived here. Zlatá ulička itself is a kind of museum. In nine of them, there are mini-museums dedicated to the former inhabitants of the street. The rest are souvenir shops.
There is a legend that alchemists lived on this street, receiving elixirs of eternal youth, gold, and a philosopher’s stone for the Emperor.
In the house № 22 lived Franz Kafka; he worked here on the collection “The Village Doctor”. Now there is a bookshop in this building.
In the house № 14, marked with a sign depicting a cat, an owl, and a crystal ball, a fortune teller had her salon. Here is also a small house under № 27, once inhabited by a local healer. The house is filled with drugs and herbs, as befits a medieval pharmacy. A jeweler’s workshop can be viewed in the house № 15.
Try to find a house near the last lantern and ghosts of alchemists, prisoners of the White Tower and other former residents!
If you haven’t visited this magical street yet or missed it while being in Prague, I think now you are looking forward to making this destination your point number one.
Zlatá ulička is open every day 9:00–17:00. After 18:00 admission is free. But keep in mind that most souvenir shops are closed by this time.
How to get there? Go subway line A or tram 5, 12, 18, 20, 22 to the stop Malostranská.
5. Finally, climb the Petřín Hill and watch Prague from the Observation Tower
There are many parks and gardens in Prague, but we strongly recommend you to visit Petřín Hill as it offers a stunning view of the city’s red brick roofs.
Built as a mini version of Paris’s Eiffel Tower, the Petrin Observation Tower is 60m high. Climb 300 steps to reach the top of the tower, and the view over Prague is magnificent.
In the spring, hundreds of apples and cherries blossom there, filling the air with a heady aroma. Have a pleasant stroll around the rose garden.
Other attractions include an observatory, a museum, a telescope, a hall of mirrors, a church, and many nice cafes.
By the way, next to the Petřín Hill, there is the Kinský Garden (Zahrada Kinských). It is rather easy to go from one park to another, just find an arch in the wall that separates them. By the way, in the Kinský Garden, you can find the Transcarpathian ancient church.
Once you have enjoyed the views of Prague, we recommend you to have dinner in Nebozizek Restaurant near Petřín Hill. You can reach it on foot or by funicular.
To reach the Observation Tower at the top of Petřín Hill, take the Funicular Railway. It departs from Ujezd street in the Lesser Town (Malá Strana), near Ujezd tram stop.
I think now you must be ready for an amazing trip to Prague. We hope our recommendations for your unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague will be helpful and you will enjoy it!

Cheers — KS !!

My wife told me this yesterday:
“I was talking to an acquaintance, and she asked if I’d ever been to Prague? I said, ‘No, but my husband’s been twice and loved it.’ I haven’t been to Prague, right?”
“Well actually, you have. You and the girls and I went with my students on that trip from Berlin to Prague. We went to the Cathedral across the river (the Vlatava) and crossed the Charles bridge on the way back. Don’t you remember how cold it was that day? The wind was killing us and our guide took the most crowded route at the busiest time of the day. And one of my students was sick and gave me her cold, remember?”
“Oh, now it’s coming back to me.”
Don’t worry. My wife’s mind is full of tasks and Buddhist philosophy, and special guides to help her family and friends, not to mention all the people she serves as their trusted therapist and whatever issues they might have. She hasn’t fogotten all the trips she’s made in our lives, but because of this slip, she asked me and her sister to help her remember all the places she has been to. We’ve done so, and it’s truly an impressive list, even if I don’t want to remember, or want her to remember, that fated trip to Hawaii she took not long after our trip to Prague.

The night the avant-garde German theater group performed at the Roxy Klub in Prague between the sets I was DJing, I knew it would get weird.
When the troupe lit an explosive, and it went off in the center of the dance floor, it caused several chunks of the plaster ceiling to rain down on the heads of the audience. After my ears stopped ringing, I cued up a song and spun some Groove Collective. Dancers filled the dance floor, gyrating around the hole left in the old cement floor by the performance artists’ dynamite.
It was another Saturday night at the Roxy in 1995.
I moved to the Czech Republic in January and was enrolled as a student at Karlova Univerzita in the mass communications department. Rather than go to class, I’d hang out with my professor, Cyril, who discovered that I was a musician and that I loved literature. He introduced me to the gang at Yazzyk Magazine.
Yazzyk was a periodical specializing in publishing East European authors and poets translated into English. It was run by a Canadian named Douglas and a Mexican-American named Tony. They hired me to be in charge of…

Athens, Vienna, & Prague
March 3rd & March 10th, 2025
Apologies, it’s been some time since my last words!
For the past two weeks, I have either been prepping for travel or have actually been moving, traveling to different countries!
March 3rd
Beginning with the long week of March 3rd, the week started off quite well, with lots on my mind, trying to prep for an absence of almost three weeks total. My flight leaving Portsmouth was on Thursday, March 6th, so I knew for the days leading up to it, I had lots to do, from getting schoolwork done before leaving, to cleaning my room and emptying my fridge, to also doing laundry and packing (which wasn’t too difficult as I’m only allowed one backpack for my budget flight ticket — which I realized after finishing my trip, I quite literally was able to do the infamous saying of “backpacking through Europe”!).
So after the somewhat stressful couple of days leading up to the trip was over, I finally was able to focus on the fun of the planning my friend Celeste and I had spent much time doing! Our first flight was to Athens, where we would stay for four nights. The flight was truthfully not the best, even though it was only four hours, it felt as if it took ages to land, thanks to the kid behind me kicking my seat, but nevertheless, we were landing in Athens, Greece, so what is there to complain about!
After figuring out how to get from the airport to the city center, we finally arrived in our (super) cozy hotel room! You’ll see why the room is so cozy in the pictures below, the bed frame was the length of the wall, haha! It was a funny encounter and experience, but it truly made our trip that much funnier and more of a memorable time 😁.
After settling into our room, it was quite late at night so we grabbed some quick food and then went to bed for our first night in Athens!
The next couple of days in Athens consisted of absolutely dreamy beautiful weather, with amazing food smells on every corner and glowing skin from the refreshing glistening Mediterranean sun. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Athens and wish I had more time to spend in the beautiful city, but I told myself it’s okay and that I would certainly make a return sometime in the future, hopefully sooner rather than later!
Some highlights of the trip were seeing the famous Ancient Greek ruins, such as the Acropolis and Parthenon, as well as visiting the waterfront, watching the sun set on the beautiful Mediterranean waters. Celeste and I were also able to meet one of our friends from Portsmouth in Athens to celebrate her birthday! We spent the day strolling throughout the beautiful city, eating delicious Greek cuisine and ending the night in a gorgeous rooftop bar with truly spectacular views of the Acropolis! Some things are better shown through pictures, so I’ll let the following pictures do the rest of explaining for our activities in Athens!
There was one other highlight of the trip that I can’t not mention, and that is Celeste and I’s encounter of a protest on a random street in Athens. So, quick story time:
It all started when Celeste and I wanted to watch the sunset on a beach along the coast of the city. The city center of Athens is actually quite far by foot to the coasts of the city, so we decided to take a bus to get us to the beach in a much easier and timely manner. Little did we know though that our innocent selves, waiting at the bus stop for a ride to the beach, would become witnesses to a quite significant protest in the city. It was a random Saturday in March on a random street in Athens in the middle of the afternoon when Celeste and I were waiting at the bus stop, watching numerous cars and buses pass by us, when all of a sudden the traffic passing by, stopped. All of a sudden, came a line of protestors holding a banner and chanting, and they entered the wide road and overtook the street. It began with quite a peaceful protest, simply walking together, united as one to fight for the cause they believed in, but within a matter of seconds, the protests escalated to another level. After long stretches of calm and peaceful protestors passed by, following just behind them was another group of protestors, but they were noticeably a different group of protestors. These young-adult looking individuals dressed in all black, covering their faces with black masks to hide their identities, came in strong after the peaceful protestors, making loud banging noises from the sledgehammers they had brought to damage public properties such as dumpsters, glass bus stops, and ATM stations. They further began to drag numerous dumpsters to the middle of the road and started fires in each dumpster… This all happened in a matter of seconds, right in front of us. Celarly, Celeste and I were quite shocked at what was happening, an experience that will truly be unforgettable for the rest of our lives. To make the experience even more memorable, out of natural instinct, we had our phones out and were taking pictures and videos of what was unfolding in front of us, but one of the young-adults in black noticed this and came up to my friend Celeste. She had been recording one of his comrades breaking an ATM with his sledgehammer, and immediately was telling her to delete the video. It was quite a heated yet calm interaction, as the boy seemed he just wanted to make sure there was no footage of them and their acts that could circulate throughout social media, is my presumption. So, after that quite stunning experience of a young man in black coming up to us and demanding us to delete a video, we realized that this definitely could escalate to a more dangerous situation. But, as I had mentioned, everything happened within a matter of seconds because shortly after that encounter, came a whole line of police troops dressed in army gear with gas masks and blockade shields, passing by us and heading towards the whole crowd of protestors. At that point, most of the protestors had made their way down the streets, so Celeste and I were luckily quite far from the protestors when we heard a loud popping noise and smoke erupt into the air from the presumed tear gas that the army had deployed at the protestors. We presumed tear gas because after the protest had settled, some protestors were pouring baby powder on their faces and eyes.
Ultimately, this once-in-a-lifetime experience was quite shocking and felt as if we were in a movie scene, casually waiting for a bus to take us to the beach, but ending in a deserted road, filled with dumpsters scattered across the streets with fire burning inside them, and papers flying in the winds from the protestors’ flyers thrown as they were chanting and walking down the streets of Athens. On the bright side though, we were completely safe, and truthfully I never felt a serious fear for my well-being, which is surprising, considering I tend to have quite an over-thinker paranoid mind. Also, after much troubleshooting of trying to find another bus and route to take us to the beach, we were able to end the day by watching the sun fall down onto the Mediterranean waters, a truly beautiful image that will also be a sight to remember!
March 10th
Moving onto our next journey, on March 10th, Celeste and I left our friend in Athens and met up with another one of our friends from Portsmouth in Vienna! We luckily found flight times that arrived in Vienna within an hour of each other so we were able to meet and reunite in the airport! From there, we figured out how to get to our accommodation, which was a nice and spacious apartment that was actually quite affordable after splitting the cost!
It was all our first time in Vienna so we were all super excited to explore the beautiful city, which began with the hunt for late-night food… food is always priority! 😄 After finding some delicious food, we walked back to our place and went to bed, ready to venture into the city, and also meet one of my friends studying in Vienna the following day!
The weather treated us quite well I’d say during our time there, which apparently, nice blue skies and wind-less spring temperature is not the regular weather in Vienna, so I guess we got lucky! Our two-day trip in Vienna essentially consisted of us three girls walking around, looking at famous landmarks while talking and sharing memorable moments, stopping at cafés and grabbing dinners to further enjoy ourselves and our time traveling together. It was truly an enjoyable time with my two friends, and I was fortunate enough to also meet up with another friend of mine who is currently living in Vienna for her studies! I met her during my working position at UNO as a Student Ambassador, so I was quite excited to meet back up with her, and in Vienna of all places!
After a few fun days of taste-testing Vienna’s most famous treats and venturing the streets of the beautiful city, a city I could definitely see myself coming back to, we packed our bags and got ready for our next journey to Prague!
Two days after Vienna, on March 13th, we took a train from Vienna to Prague which was quite short and enjoyable, and we got an interesting seating booth for the train, something I’ve never experienced before! In Prague, we had a similar agenda to Vienna, simply walking and exploring the city, enjoying our time together while also seeing the beautiful Historic European architecture of the city. In Prague, I was again fortunate to meet up with another friend who is currently studying in Brno, Czechia, a city not too far from Prague! She is a fellow student from UNO who is also on an exchange program, and we actually met through a previous study abroad experience at UNO a couple years ago! So, we got in touch and were able to meet in Prague for the day and explore the city together!
Prague was the farthest East country I’ve travelled to in Europe, and it was quite enjoyable up until an unfortunate circumstance occurred on our last day in Prague… but, we’ll address that later!
Overall, Prague as a city is quite enjoyable and has many beautiful sights to see, with some different, but tasty traditional meals. Unfortunately during our time there, it was quite rainy and cloudy and cold, but that didn’t stop our ventures and fun experiences in the city, including a river cruise with a lunch buffet! It was the first cruise with meal experience I’ve ever had, so it was quite enjoyable, sitting comfortably in the warmth of the boat while also seeing the city and eating delicious foods from the buffet (which I’d say we definitely got our money’s worth 😋). We also were determined to try a famous trending traditional dessert in Prague, one which I forgot the name of but will insert a picture of it below! It’s a delicious cone made of sugary bread filled with strawberries and melted chocolate (and sometimes ice cream), and it was quite enjoyable and definitely recommended for dessert lovers!
Now, onto the unfortunate circumstance…
It was our last day in Prague when we decided to try a famous café that ChatGPT recommended us to try. For the time we had spent in Prague, we used walking as our main form of transportation, as many things conveniently were located near each other. But, because it was our last day and we had been tired of walking around for many days prior, we decided to try out the public transit to rest our legs but also test out how to use their transportation system, as we needed to use the metro the following day to arrive at the airport from the city center. So, we walked to the tram stop that would take us to the café, where we looked for a ticket booth to buy a tram ticket, but there were none to be found. So, we assumed we would need to simply purchase a ticket on-board the tram, as some public transit systems have a tap-to-pay machine installed in the trams/buses. So, when the tram had arrived, we got on and saw a machine where the ticket could be bought. The tram was full of people, to the point that shoulders were touching for anyone nearby each other, and the only machine to buy the ticket was down near the exit door of the tram. So, we had planned to walk towards the back of the tram to the ticket machine, but the tram took off and we had lost balance for a bit, so we resettled and balanced ourselves, and shortly after this, a man in casual dark clothes approached us. He said “ticket check”, “I need to see your tickets”. We told the man, wearing no uniform but holding a ring badge to show his identity as a ticket inspector, that we had just got on the train and we needed to make our way down the train to purchase our tickets. He had quite a heavy accent and we were not completely sure if he understood what we had been telling him, but he kept repeating the question of needing to see our tickets, in which we kept responding that we had just arrived on the tram to buy them. He quickly became defensive and said that we are not allowed to ride the trams for free, stating in Czechia, people are not allowed to use public transit for free. He then asked us for our passports, implying that he knew we were not from the country, which attributes to my suspected belief that we were targeted for this “scheme” because we were quite obviously tourists. So, after he had taken our passports and “inspected” them, he told us that we had to follow him and leave the tram. He was holding onto all three of our passports at this point and was making his way towards the exit of the tram. So, I asked if we could get our passports back at least and he insisted that later he would give them back but we needed to follow him to exit the tram. From the time this man approached us and began assertively accusing us of trying to ride the tram for free, my suspicions of this man being a scammer was at the forefront of my mind. At that moment when he had taken our passports and was walking towards the exit of the tram, I was quite nervous and rushed to thinking that at any moment, this man could run and steal our passports (a fear of mine especially because this happened to my mom’s friend the last time she was in Prague). So, at that moment, I was a bit on edge about what could be the end result of this interaction with a man who claimed to be a ticket inspector. Luckily though, I kept my trails right behind him to ensure if anything were to happen, he wouldn’t be too far from me. We eventually all got off the tram and the man had told us yet again, that we were not allowed to ride the tram for free. We further continued to defend ourselves and describe our situation, as he truly had approached us after about a minute of stepping onto the tram. When we were talking to him about our situation, another man walked over in a similar non-uniform look, with the same ring badge, where he was consulted on what to do in this situation. This man, who was supposedly another ticket inspector, told us the same thing, that we weren’t allowed to be on the tram for free and because we didn’t pay for a ticket, we would be fined. This same man further asked what passports we held, and he saw an Italian and American passport, in which he made a quite abrasive and quite honestly offensive remark to the fact that we were Americans, which is yet another reason why I felt we were targeted. Ultimately though, these two men were saying that we had to pay the fine, and there was no way to get ourselves out of it, no matter how many times we had explained the circumstances we were in. They showed no leniency whatsoever and were constantly assertive in the fact that, because we hadn’t purchased a less than 2 Euro tram ticket at the time he had approached us, that we would be fined nearly 45 Euros each. He had further threatened that if we didn’t want to pay him now, ministry transport officers would be called and we would have to go to the ministry office of transport, and pay an even higher fine of almost 70 Euros. At this time, I had still had the idea that we could be confronted by scammers, so before agreeing to anything, I Googled the public transit fine laws in Prague to ensure that what he was saying, was valid. After looking at the ministry’s website and some articles, the man’s words had aligned with what the written laws stated, but, in my eyes, it still didn’t necessarily legitimize him as an authentic ticket inspector. The Google search I made also warned that some scammers may be at play, impersonating to be authentic ticket inspectors, so it warned that their badges should be inspected to authenticate their legitimacy. So, I had asked to see their badge, which I had already seen when the man first approached us, as he showed us his badge ring. I looked at the badge, but felt quite unknowledgeable, as I didn’t know how to tell if the badge was legitimate or not, so there wasn’t much I could do at that point. After this attempt, for a moment, we had collectively considered letting them call the ministry transit officers to come and prove their authenticity as ticket inspectors. But, they warned us, as the law stated, if we called the ministry transit officers, we would have to pay a higher fine than if we just agreed to pay these ticket inspectors there on the spot, which is one aspect of the city’s transit laws that I personally believe is truthfully, incredibly illogical and unfair. Ultimately, after being quite spooked and frazzled from the situation we found ourselves in, we decided to just pay the men the nearly 45 Euros they had asked for. After paying and leaving these men, we walked a couple steps away from the stop we were forced to be at, and had debriefed on what just happened. We were all quite emotional, feeling angry, scared, sad, nervous, and a bit skeptical about what had just happened. So, we did what any young lady would do in a frazzling situation such as this one, and all got on the phone with our mothers and described with all our emotions, the situation that just occurred. Ultimately though, our valuable Mothers’ advices were to not let this situation impact the rest of our day and time in Prague, and that at least we were safe and nothing terrible like our passports being stolen, happened. This was true, but for the rest of the day, our moods were all collectively quite down and we had felt quite irritated at the situation that had happened. In fact, we had been so scarred and angered from the situation, that the next day, we just booked an Uber to take us to the airport, and luckily this easier, stress-less, and more secure option wasn’t too much more expensive.
So, to come to a close on our experience and perceptions on Prague, our time there was truly quite nice and enjoyable up until the moment that we had arguably been targeted by the supposed ministry ticket inspectors of the city. So, as of now, I have mixed emotions and thoughts on Prague, and am not completely sure if it’s a city I feel I could return to again, which is quite unfortunate.
Ultimately though, to end the blog on a brighter note, after our upsetting last experience in Prague, we had a new journey to look forward to. On March 15th, we took the flight back “home” to London Gatwick, where we spent a couple hours in the airport eating and resting to gain energy for our next flight to Dublin, which was on the same day, and the next journey to be discussed!
So, reflecting on the past two-weeks spent abroad, there were many fun, new, and exciting experiences and memories, but it was also naturally a bit tiring, but as mentioned, the traveling did not stop there… who needs rest?!
So, until the next post and journey,
See you then!
From,
Kyla

Prague is a winter city. Summer is nice there but Prague doesn’t feel comfortable with summer. It’s in the winter where Prague is at its most self-expressed, when it shines, or rather glows. Anyone who has walked in winter on the lonely cobblestone streets under the lamp posts emitting ochre light knows how Kafka got his inspiration.

On October 24, 2023, AWS Cloud Day Prague at Forum Karlín brought together 1,500 tech enthusiasts and developers to learn about the latest AWS technologies and partner solutions. The event was a must-attend for any business looking to get into the cloud game or improve their cloud strategy.
The event kicked off with a morning keynote from Tibor Kolejak (Senior Director, Enterprise for the Czech Republic & Slovakia at AWS), Clare Liguori (Senior Principal Software Engineer at AWS), and customer speakers. It focused on the current status of cloud adoption in Central Eastern Europe, the latest advancements in infrastructure and analytics, new products such as AWS’s generative AI Bedrock, and how customers are using AWS to achieve their goals faster and unlock new opportunities.
Throughout the day, attendees had the opportunity to attend 30+ sessions to find out more about the latest advances in AWS technologies, cloud innovations, and inspiring success stories. The sessions covered everything from the basics of cloud computing to cutting-edge cloud innovations. But you had to make sure to come early if you wanted to get in — that’s how popular they were! Check out the full agenda here.
In addition to the technical sessions and workshops, the event featured an expo hall where attendees could meet with AWS partners and learn about their cloud solutions. The expo hall was a hub of networking, discussions, and super friendly people.
If you’re a business looking to get into the cloud game or improve your cloud strategy, Revolgy is the company you need to meet at AWS Cloud Day Prague. We’re an AWS Advanced Partner with a team of certified cloud experts who can help you with everything from cloud migration to cloud security.

Skeletons appear to crawl out of front yards. Some wave at me, and others seem to be enjoying themselves on porch swings as though they’re still dressed in muscle, organs, and skin and are filled with oxygen and life. Pumpkins line steps, some already carved, their faces misshapen and sagging from the heat in this part of the country, smiles now frowns melting onto the pavement.
Haunted houses are available throughout the city, replicating horrors we can also view on television and movie screens. These experiences provide people with the psychological opportunity to feel the relief of being able to survive or walk away from something that is not actually dangerous.
Sometimes, we walk through cities on “ghost tours” to hear stories about hauntings, what happened long ago to spur these legends, and to decide whether any spirits are restless. Maybe we go because we want to learn; perhaps we want to understand. Maybe we want to know the unknowable between life and death.
Executions of every variety were town spectator shows hundreds of years ago in Prague, and the heads of decapitated noblemen were suspended from the towers at both ends of the Charles Bridge. Macabre scenes like this…

After — back in May 2000 — I secured my monthly Metro pass, moved into my crash-pad, and got all of the visa, residence, and working permit paperwork half-way done, the real problem started: Where to get a coffee that actually deserves its name? Plus, what café or coffeehouse in good old Praha 1 (roughly) can you sit in comfortably and read, write, watch people, and/or chat? Back then, Prague didn’t have much that compared favorably to the coffeehouses in Vienna[1], or even some Starbucks outlet.
Things have seriously changed since then. It started around 2002 with a series of CoffeeHeaven outlets, a Polish coffee and sandwich chain that modeled itself after Starbucks but which had to sell years back all its outlets to London-based Costa Coffee. These days it seems that Costa Coffee has at least one shop on every downtown block. I still have my CoffeeHeaven bonus card, and Costa Coffee honor it, and I feel very smug every time I use it.
Around 2007–8, Starbucks finally invaded Prague with a couple of strategically located outlets and has since added a number of outlets, mostly in downtown. Google Starbucks in Prague. You can have your first SBUX fix at the airport. There are outlets for example at Václavské nám. 40 (corner Štěpánská), Jungmannova 34, Spálená 74/18 (near metro station Národní třída), and a couple of them near Old Town Square and so on. Can’t really miss them. The offerings are standard, as is the coffee and the food-stuff they offer. I have come to appreciate them because many of them are spacious (e.g., second level at Václavské nám. or the yuuuge Jungmannova outlet), they have free and reasonably good wifi (and no one cares whether you sit there for hours and hammer away), and the staff tends to be friendly and know what they are doing. Unfortunately that is often not true for many of the Costa Coffee places which can be claustrophobic, are run by staff that occasionally seems in over its head, and just seem less well-trained and efficient than their SBUX counterparts. That said, the Costa Coffee outlet in the Václavské nám. (“Rokoko”) pasáž remains one of my fav meeting places, increasingly though due to its centrality and short walking distance from my Praha workplace rather than the foodstuff or coffee they offer.
There are, of course, scores of nice stand-alone places (or minor chains such as mamacoffee, about which more in a sec) where you can have a good kava and read, write, chat comfortably, and/or dream. In short, places that fulfil the Rubinstein criterion, i.e., a place “where you can … think!” (I note parenthetically that for Ariel — who drinks strongly watered down instant coffee — it is all about the ambiance, while for me it is about both the environs and the quality of the coffee!)
In the neighborhood where I live (Prague 10, Vršovice), there were — before the pandemic — about a dozen cafes (no less than three within 20 meters of the Ruská tram stop) of which many were quite nice. Unfortunately, half of them have shut down. If you happen to be in my hood, do try this one which happens to pass the Rubinstein test with flying colors. As does this one, just a hundred meters down the road.
But this write-up is about cafes and coffee houses in Praha 1. So there. Talking about places that don’t exist any longer but that nurtured my coffee addiction while living in Prague: a shout-out to now defunct Ebel Coffee House, Kawa Kawa Kawa, and the Tonkin café!
Prague’s is still not quite comparable to the coffee culture that exists in Sydney or Melbourne but getting a good coffee in Prague is no longer the very real problem it was back in May 2000. Tripadvisor, under Restaurants in Prague, subsection Coffee & Tea, currently lists 367 places.
Below are the results of my recent, and very diligent, research in matters kava in Prague 1 (downtown). Suggestions for places I missed, or even dissenting opinions, are always welcome. Send to aortmann@gmail.com, or comment below if you like.
I take responsibility for all errors in judgement.
My current favorites follow presently (places I don’t much like have their own section at the end); note that none of my thirteen recommendations has made it to the top ten in the Tripadvisor ranking of best 10 cafés in Praha 1 (City Center). I am sure that those in the Tripadvisor top ten fail the Rubinstein test (Coffee Places where you can … think!)
Divadelini kavarna, attached to STUDIO DVA DIVADLO, Wenceslas Square 56, nestled away in a pasaz (Fenix palace/Palac Fenix)
Located in a pasaz off Vaclavske namesti but hidden enough to normally not being discovered by tourists, this has been one of my favorites for years.
You can sit inside and outside (in the pasaz that is), they offer coffee and wine and some fine food stuff such as omelettes, pancakes, hommos and avocado sandwiches, cheesecake with raspberry sauce, chocolate curd cake, etc.
A great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee, or a glass of wine for that matter. Note the pictures on the wall — portraits of less or more famous Czech actors. Don’t be surprised if you see one of these folks at the table next to you. That’s because this is the place where the actors go, after the show and before, and before and after practices at the attached divadlo, too.
The restaurant/kavarna is open from 9:00 am to 23:00 on weekdays and at 11:00 on weekends or holidays; breakfast is served until 11 only. So no omelettes on the weekend. Shucks because their omelettes are to die for.
They do have free wifi.
I can’t find them on Tripadvisor or Facebook.
Warning: There’s a bunch of divadelini kavarnas out there, so make sure you go to right one.
Monkey Coffee House Opletalova 922/8 Praha 1 (and also Pod Harfou 995/23)
A somewhat Spartan coffee house although they also have wine on offer. They (and I’m talking about the Opletalova site which opened early in 2023) have some sweet stuff (brownies, banana bread, impressive croissants) but various kinds of excellent coffees (including hand brews) and it’s a great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee.
The Opletalova site opens at 8 am and closes at 6 pm, all week including weekends (as of now) when they currently start at 10 am.
They do have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook although most of the pictures there are for the Pod Harfou site for now. They are on Instagram, too. My Tripadvisor review is here.
Bonus: Across the street from them is a place that offers a well-stocked assortment of Italian food imports, from coffee capsules, to chocolate, to grappa, and vino. Also, a few meters to the right there’s a cafe with lots of fabulous cakes etc. and next to that is a bakery with incredibly good bread.
Cafe Academia Vaclavske Namesti 792/34
This is in the middle of the city and Tourist Central. But you won’t know because the cafe is clearly frequented mostly by locals, last but not least (older) ladies reading in the books from the bookstore. ;-)
The cafe is nestled away on the second floor, in the back, of the Academia bookstore (which in fact is where you find the academic books). The coffee is surprisingly good. (Not quite of Monkey Coffee House quality but then what is ?!) They also have some sweet and tempting stuff (and even a cheese or ham&cheese toast, with salad) and a few house wines, in case you want to ease into winetime. ;-)
The bookstore of which the cafe is a part of is large and one of the better ones in Prague. (They have a sizable section of English language books downstairs.)
While the cafe is quite nice — real flowers and comfy chairs and all, with service that has some upside potential— , there is also balcony overlooking Václavské náměstí on the other side of the second floor. Great view!
They are open from 9–19:30 on weekdays and 10–18:30/17:30 on weekends.
They do not have free wifi but my eduroam connected automatically and just fine. (There is also free wifi in much of downtown Prague, so you should be able to log in from pretty much everywhere.)
You can find the Academia cafe on Tripadvisor and Facebook. They are on Instagram, too.
Spell Jindřišská 939/20, nestled away in a yard, entrance next to the (awful) Green Tomato restaurant, and attached to a hair studio
You can sit inside and outside, they offer coffee (not bad, but not of Monkey Coffee House quality) and some sweet stuff including a bowl with tvarok and fruit that is excellent. They have wine, too.
Another great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee, or a glass of wine or two.
They are open from 7:00 am to 20:00 on weekdays and open at 8:00 and 10:00 on weekends when they close earlier (14:00 and 18:00 it seems).
They do have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook and also Instagram.
The Barrister café and winebar (Kavárna | Vinárna) Štěpánská 629/59 (across the street from the Alcron Hotel, a few metres down the street, literally a stone’s throw away from Wenceslas Square)
A wide and stylish space, where you can sit and read and write. And have conversations. And where you can segue from coffee time to wine time without having to change the location. What’s not to like?
The coffee is good, as are the wine offerings. They do have some sweets, and a couple of other food offerings. Their menu is here. For downtown Prague the prices are reasonable.
The service is friendly and professional, mostly.
Open every weekday 8:00 to 22:00 and during the vikend from 9:00 to 22:00 and 13:00, respectively.
They have free wifi.
You can find them on Instagram here and on Facebook here (mostly in Czech though). The do have a (claimed) Tripadvisor page but there are no reviews yet as of 26 June 2025. Give it a try!
Sicily café Senovážné nám. 994/2 Praha 1
It is both a kavarna and restaurant. You can find their offerings here (in Czech and English); lots of nice stuff (lots of veg(etari)an options).
It’s a good place to work, shoot the breeze, or have conversations although it does get quite crowded around lunch time, so if you like to work there, it is best to go there in off-peak hours.
They open at 8:30 on weekdays and 9:30 on the weekend and close at 22:00 (except Sunday when they close at 21:00).
Breakfast weekdays until 12:00 and weekends all day.
They have free wifi although “sometimes it don’t work” as a waitress (who clearly could not care less) informed me on a recent outing.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook. My 2016 Tripadvisor review is here.
Mama café Vodičkova 10 Praha 1 (about 5 minutes leisurely walk from Václavské náměstí, follow the tram tracks)
It’s part of a chain that has other branches in Prahe 2, 3, 4, and Praha 7. There is apparently another related café in Praha 1 (Café NEZISK at Pohořelec 2). A trust-worthy informant tells me that the Vinohrady (also Praha 2) site is even better than the Vodičkova site.
The Vodičkova site is both a kavarna and restaurant that has daily menus of brekkie (scrambled eggs, curd pancakes, granola), various hummus related dishes (e.g., hummus with pita, hummus bowl, mezze plate), and sandwiches (e.g with egg spread or green pea spread); lots of veg(etari)an options. You can substitute the pita with veggie sticks if you so desire. Plus plenty of sweet stuff (cakes!) of tempting quality. You can find their offerings here (in Czech and English and several other languages). The food is really quite good and relatively inexpensive. Say, simple scrambled eggs are 165 koruns and come with a lovely serving of coleslaw, or some other salad du jour. The espresso is on the bitter side for my taste; the latte, even if strong, is on the weak side.
It’s a great place to work though, shoot the breeze, or have conversations although it does get quite crowded quickly (e.g., on a recent Saturday morning at 10 a.m. all seats were occupied), so if you like to work there, it is best to go there in off-peak hours.
They open at 8:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on the weekend and close at 22:00 (except weekends when they close at 20:00). Service tends to be exceptionally nice.
They do have free wifi (and it works best on the upper floor which is also much more spacious than the ground floor.)
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook.
Prague Bakeshop Kozi 1
This place existed when I moved to Prague in 2000. It was under different ownership then and has been a bit modernized but it is basically the same configuration and many of the same goodies and the same coffee cups etc.
It’s not a place where you could work; too crowded especially during peak hours. (Beware of pocket thiefs then in particular.) The saving grace are the wooden benches outside. In fact, that’s where you find me many Saturday and Sunday mornings. That’s because it’s the best place in downtown Prague to get a good coffee at 7 a.m. every day of the week. (Yes, that includes Saturdays and Sundays.) Plus, the area in which the Prague Bakeshop is located (very very close to Old Town Square), is absolutely peaceful and gorgeous that early in the morning. (Well, mostly, if you can ignore the drunkards, and shady characters, that spill out of the bars across the street. Most of them are fun to watch.)
A great way to start the day. In fact, I can’t think of a much better way to start it. Try their croissants, dorty (cakes), kolaces (tarts, tortes, pies), sandwiches, or quiches. Or their coffee (which for my taste is on the weak side but drinkable).
Open every day 7–21.
They now have (free) wifi. Took them a long time to get there! (Pro-tip: It sometimes does not work but outside you can log into the free wifi of the James Dean club across the street.)
You can study their menu here, in both Czech and English.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook. My 2018 Tripadvisor review is here.
Head Shot Coffee Palackého 720/5, located in the Franciscan Gardens, in the corner furthest away from the entrances
A fairly small space with a lovely outside, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It’s not the kind of place that a tourist would easily find; it seems indeed frequented by locals mostly.
HSC offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of deliciously looking cakes etc. A few sandwiches and hummus, too.
Open every week day from 8:00 to 19:30. Saturdays and Sunday they are currently open from 10:00 to 18:00.
They have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor, and Facebook and Instagram.
Café Truhlárna Františkánská zahrada, Jungmannovo nám. 751/19 (when you enter the Gardens from Jungmanova namesti, 50 meters to the left)
A fairly small space with a lovely outside, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It’s not the kind of place that a tourist would easily find but they do occasionally, although the Truhlarna folks advertise themselves and their wares on a blackboard outside in Czech only; it seems frequented by locals mostly.
The cafe offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of deliciously looking cakes etc. A few sandwiches, too. Very friendly staff.
Open every day except Sunday from 8:30 to 20:00 except for Saturday and Sunday when they start at 10:00.
They have free wifi and their network is called zahrahda; password is posted at the counter.
You can find them on Tripadvisor, and Facebook and Instagram.
Goodlok café Jungmannovo namEsti 18 (next to the entrance to Francescan Gardens, near the SBUX on Jungmannovo namEsti)
A wide open space, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. Although I suspect, it being in Tourist Central neighborhood, the staff would not look at you too kindly if you sit there for hours at a time. Or for that matter, potential visitors.
Goodlok offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of fruit juices and kombuchas. They also have omelettes (very good indeed, I had), kimchi-toasts, and other offerings. Food is served until 15:00 Personnel is friendly.
Open every weekday 8:00 to 18:00; not open on weekends it seems.
They have free wifi.
You can study their menu here, in Czech.
You can find them on Tripadvisor (two sites! here and here, few reviews but raves all the same), and Instagram.
Kavarna Adria formally, Národní 40, but adjacent to Jungmannovo namEsti (on the second floor of the massive Palác Adria building)
This is an amazing space (including a very large terrasse), where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It is still to some extent Tourist Central neighborhood (last but not least since the place is written up in many a tourist guide), alas … my experiences have been mostly good. But then I rarely get anything complicated. Mostly caffe lattes (strong) or double espressos, occasionally the cheese omelette, very occasionally a poppy seed cake, etc. I should mention that the dozen or so cakes Adria has on offer are superb and if you are sweet-tooth, you definitely want to try a couple at least.
Service runs the gamut and I am not surprised to see service on Tripadvisor rated a dismal 3.5. With some reporting pretty bad experiences.
Open weekdays 8:00 to 23:00, and weekends from 9:00 to 22:00.
They have free wifi.
You can study their (lunch) menu here, in Czech and English.
Coffee Cube Black Jungmannovo nám. 6/767 (Thanks, Michael!)
Fantova kavarna Wilsonova 300/8
Tynska Literarni Kavarna Tynska 630/6
Kavarna Kampus Hybernská Hybernská 4 (Thanks, Sebastian!)
Super Tramp Coffee Opatovická 160 (Thanks, Elisaveta!)
Liliová (Choco Café) Liliová 250/4 (Thanks, Adela!)
So these are my favorite places right now, most of them not well-known but I am confident you will not be disappointed. There are many more well-known cafes and coffeehouses in Prague such as Café Louvre (not bad actually but failing the Rubinstein test), Café Slavia, Café Savoy (all on the tram 22 line, within a kilometer), Cerna Madona/Grand Café Orient, BISTRO, Café Boulevard (currently an astonishing 1.5 on Tripadvisor! Avoid!), etc.
[1] As Lenka Reinerova — may she rest in peace — put it, “Where, so I ask myself often when I wander through my Prague, have all the coffeehouses gone; those coffeehouses where, over a cup of good black coffee, you could spend much of the day discussing, making plans, hearing the latest gossip, watching — or getting to know — interesting people, making friends, or even falling in love.” (Das Traumcafé einer Pragerin [my café in the sky, 1996; my translation.)

For all those that did not have the opportunity to attend this great event last Thursday (on the 27th of April), reading this post will help you get a nice overview of the experience. For those lucky ones that did attend, it will be a nice reminder (and a mental confirmation that you need to also be there next year!).
Of course, huge congratulations and many thanks to the Neklo team that organised this Meet Magento event. Apart from having planned all the details, different members of their Team were available to help with anything.
Approximately 200 people from many different countries gathered in the same place to attend the 2nd Meet Magento Prague. Although I did not expect this, the event was a truly international one, as I met people from US, UK, Poland, India, Dubai and Italy (and I am missing some countries for sure, as I did not have the opportunity to meet all people). As Igor nicely put it:
This is not a CZ-focused Magento event but rather the gathering of the international Meet Magento community in Prague (Igor Bondarenko, Neklo)
Lot of great content in the 21 Talks from experienced speakers on topics ranging from Magento development and tactics to grow an ecommerce store to insights from a scaling startup and the keynote from the Director of Zoo Prague.
Last, but not least, many litres of beer at the afterparty, as you can clearly see :)
As Thomas Goletz has shared this was the first Meet Magento event presented at a big and luxurious cinema hall! To be honest, for me this was also a 1st as I have never attended another event at a cinema hall. And what an experience this was!
There are 3 reasons why a cinema hall is perfect for such an event, namely acoustics, visuals and comfort. In respect to the visuals, I can just say that these were some great, big, high-quality screens (that you could also play video-games on!, as you can see in the tweets below). Lastly, the seats were absolutely great and comfortable, something that you are not getting in business events.
After the event, there were buses waiting to take us to the afterparty venue where there was a live band playing music, great food and lots of alcohol. What else can you ask for?
As I already mentioned there were 21 Talks, organises in 2 tracks (business, technical) from some inspiring, international speakers. The event had a really good flow with a nice cohesion between the Talks, that were organised on the various sessions by theme.
Following I am sharing my view on some of the Talks I listened to. Although I would love to have attended all Talks, I did not. And this was for a great reason, which is to get to know and communicate with amazing people from different places. Every attendee I met had something interesting to share either from one of the Talks or from their own experience.
The 1st Talk in the event agenda was planned for Thomas Goletz, the founder of Meet Magento Association. Unfortunately Thomas was not able to come, but he had recorded a video that we watched, showing his deep commitment to all the Events. Moreover, Lydia from the MMA Team was there and presented all the great things that are done by the Meet Magento Association and how big and impactful our community is.
After Lydia, Ben took the stage to share all the latest updates on Magento. This is not just a speaker, but THE Ben Marks, Magento evangelist and all-star Magento celebrity.
Ben shared the latest data about how big Magento has become, mentioning that Magento Stores sell a combined of $101B each year! Metrics are rising on every dimension be it # of stores, Partners, events or Magento installations (both M1 and M2). Following shared all the updates on M2 and the integration of companies that were acquired and are being integrated on the Magento platform.
The first session ended with a Talk on the insights gained from the growth of the scaling startup, Taxify. Roman briefly shared how the company was founded by a 19yr old boy before joining university and all their progress till now, valued at $80M. Especially interesting were their approach into competing with Uber, a bigger and more well-funded competitor. In short, he insisted on trying to become the best at what you do, not only at a local level but aiming high to become the best in the world!
Filip is a marketing executive from Fujitsu Technology Solutions. His talk focused on the importance of data in order to successfully operate a growing ecommerce business. He mentioned the proliferation of available data and how we can combine them in order to get actionable insights using Big Data technologies.
Lucas’s Talk on their experience from M2 implementations was really clear, data-based and full of insights and this is something that I heard from different people. He shared benchmarks on M1 vs M2 implementations in terms of time needed and current pain points on this process, providing all attendees with a nice framework to think about their next implementation.
5 latest email marketing trends for 2017 (Kristina Pototskaya, Triggmine)
Setting up an ecommerce store is really important, but without lots of relevant traffic one cannot grow. Email marketing is one of the top growth drivers and Kristina shared all the latest trends. The most important learning is that using technology, a store can intelligently segment its email list and send relevant, timely and personalised campaigns that can deliver great ROI.
This is the 2nd time I had the pleasure to see Kristina presenting and what I must day is that she really shares insights and adds value while also making us also laugh with her upbeat style.
Effectively promoting a store with digital advertising is key to ecommerce success. Alex shared his framework for doubling the revenue of a store using Facebook Ads either for retargeting or for prospecting. By growing 30% each dimension (frequency, recency, average value) a store can more than x2 its revenue. This was not theory talk, but really actionable tips!
Miles has vast experience from growing Magento stores using digital marketing. In this Talk, he shared how they are auditing a store in terms of SEO and what are the low-hanging fruits that you can take work on in order to grow your store. (I really loved the carefuly designed, great visuals from this presentation. It was as if they were a best practice example from Presentation Zen book).
Another beautifully designed presentation. Victor talked about impactful design by showing us different techniques and best practices on all the areas of an ecommerce website. While he was talking, it was more than clear that he was speaking from vast experience.
If you reached this far, it is more than sure that you have understood what a great event this was! A truly international event in a great venue with many Talks. I have to say just one thing; see you there next year!
And I would close this post by asking all of us to try to contribute on Magento in order to continue to build such a powerful ecommerce platform. The slide with ways to get involved is from Ben Marks presentation.
Thank you for reading!

July 16th, 2010
Prague… the jewel of Eastern Europe. I had extremely high hopes and aspirations for this city when I was originally planning my trip; so much so, I had once considered quitting my job and moving here to teach English. However, upon my arrival, I was so enervated and downtrodden that I was afraid I’d never leave the hostel. Suffice it to say that I think I have literally reached the breaking point of my body. Two months of non-stop partying, travelling, sleepless nights in noisy hostels, poor diet and dangerous excursions have beaten me to a pulp. My back feels like that of an 80-year-old man, and my knee gets worse with each passing day. I can barely walk, and stairs prove to be quite a challenge. I have felt sick for over a week now, no doubt the result of some foreign virus or bacteria I ingested with my head on a filthy hostel pillow. But ultimately, I set out on this trip not to complain or be hindered by bodily aches, but to live, learn, and make memories and friends for a lifetime! So enough with the whining… suck it up and get on with the damn blog!
Tim, Kevin and I arrived in Prague after a 9-hour train ride… it was supposed to be a 5-hour ride. Don’t ask me how it ended up so late because I have no clue. It sucked because I hadn’t eaten before I left, and had zero Hungarian or Czech currency on me to grab a bite in the dining car. To make matters worse, once we passed the border into Slovakia, we were approached by the conductor for our tickets. I brandished my Eurail pass, as I had done countless other times, but in this case, the man said in broken English “no good in Slovakia!” You have got to be kidding me. This douchebag is yelling that my rail pass isn’t valid in his country and I had to buy another ticket to just pass through! When I told him I had no cash, and learned he didn’t accept credit, he threatened to kick me off the train at the next stop. Luckily Tim and Kevin were able to pull together just enough change for me to stay on board, for which I am super thankful because when we finally saw the next town, it looked like that scene in Eurotrip when they arrive in Eastern Europe and it’s a cold war era ghost town. I highly doubt an ATM existed there.
We arrived into Prague, grabbed a quick lunch together, and then I set out hobbling about for a solid hour to find my hostel. A cab would have been nice, but I still didn’t have any cash. I checked in and set about meeting new people at the bar, and finally indulge in Czech beers, purported to be the best in the world. It was too late to explore the city, so I might as well explore these fine pilsner brews! I must admit, they are delicious, and certainly on par with the German lagers, but I’m sorry Czech Republic… nothing will ever beat the Belgian beers. They continue to reign supreme. I caught a healthy buzz, but was strangely exhausted from the train ride, even though I just sat there doing nothing the entire afternoon. I plopped into my bed, but was granted very little sleep due to my room being as hot as a sauna. There was a heat wave tearing through Prague this particular week, and this hostel (despite being rated the best in the city) had no AC. Fantastic.
The next morning, I set out to explore and learn about the city. Prague is positively gorgeous, with a massively winding river in the center, the biggest castle in Europe placed upon a hill in the background (every successive king would add a new section to it over the millennia, and it now consists of dozens of architecture types, from Gothic to Nouveau to Victorian…very cool), and houses of every color imaginable. It seems that at the fall of Communism, the people could not wait to paint their bleak and monotonous homes in vivid yellows, greens, reds, and blues… a veritable Easter basket of tones!
Another striking feature of this city, which is in stark contrast to say Budapest, is how old it truly is. While Budapest, Munich, and some other cities were ravaged by war and rebuilt to appear old, Prague survived the onslaught relatively unscathed. And there are two reasons why; one is a tale of heroism and triumph, the other purely sinister…
Hitler loved Prague and considered it a true gem of a city. When the Nazis came in and started deporting all of the Jews to death camps, he did something he did not do in other cities. As opposed to razing all of the Jewish edifices, as he had done in other cities, he chose to leave them standing. The reason being that after he had completed the eradication of an entire race, he would set up the Jewish quarter of Prague as a sort of museum: a testament to a destroyed group of people. As a result of this sick bastard’s intentions, the Jewish district is oddly well preserved, and thus very beautiful. In fact, the oldest still-functioning Jewish temple resides here, and is actually comprised of bricks from the original Solomon’s temple in Israel.
The other reason for Prague’s survival was the Citizen Uprising, an amazing story of a small group of people revolting against the brutal Nazis. At the very end of the war, the people were so angry at the Nazis, they wanted to fight back and show that they would not tolerate any more injustices. When Patton and his American regiments were within 60 miles of the city, the people took to the streets with whatever weapons they could fashion (pots and pans, broomsticks, bricks, etc.) and starting beating the Nazis to death, despite overwhelming losses due to Nazi machine guns. The hope was that the Americans would soon arrive and support them. However, unknown to them, the agreement between the US and the Soviets had Prague just east of the demarcation line, and thus Patton was unable to advance any farther. Knowing this, the Nazis began to furiously fight back. But then an odd thing happened; Nazis started shooting other Nazis! These were in fact Russians who had defected to Germany to fight with the Nazis, for they thought that Hitler was the lesser of two evils when compared to Stalin. These defectors, knowing the Red Army was only two days away, decided it would be better to surrender to the Americans rather than be executed by their former countrymen. The Nazis were confused as to who to fight, so they retreated, but began to burn the city down. Knowing that the Americans and Soviets were both pushing forward, they decided it might be in their best interest to regroup to protect Berlin. The Prague citizens, watching their great city begin to burn, did an interesting thing: they proposed a truce to the Nazis. If the Nazis would leave, without destroying another building, the citizens would not fire upon them. And so it was… the Nazis left, and the people rejoiced!… for a whopping two days. When the Soviets arrived, they took credit for the expulsion of the Nazis, and until 1989 when Communism crumbled, no one knew this amazing tale of how 30,000 Prague citizens fought off over a million Nazis. Amazing.
After my history lesson, I prepared to head out on the Prague Underground, supposedly the best pub crawl in all of Europe. But it started to pour, so I called it an early night. The next afternoon, I met up with Cammy (Florence), Sarah (Budapest), Kevin (Nice), and Chris (Corfu), and we set out on the pub crawl. The first bar was jam packed, but for 90 minutes, it was unlimited beer, wine, and shots of vodka/rum. We descended upon the bar with a vendetta; I think I was able to stomach about 12 shots and 10 beers before the heat became unbearable. At one point, I pleaded with the bartender to blast me with the cocktail gun; he obliged and soaked me in a stream of soda water… and everyone behind me! I was now dripping wet, but hammered and happy!
We continued on to bar after bar, until ultimately along the walk I realized I had to profusely urinate. I ran down into a metro stop, but was instantly dismayed to see that it had been locked up for the night. I hobbled back up to the streets to find an open store that may allow me to use their bathroom, but everything was closed. I turned the corner and walked down an alley looking for another bar, but I hit a dead end. When I headed back the way I came, I was shocked to see that someone had come along and trapped me inside this alley! A huge metal gate was stretched across the doorway, and there was no way out! I tried ripping it open, knocking on doors and windows, and screaming for the culprit who had locked me in, all to no avail. Great… let’s climb this here 12-foot wall on a torn knee ligament.
Just as I crested over the other side, I lost my grip and plummeted straight onto the concrete. As I lay cursing this gate prankster, an elderly woman came shuffling over to me. Oh how pleasant, a local is coming to my aid! What she had to say next was the most disturbing/hilarious thing I had heard in weeks! “Oh my, you have big fall! You are big boy! Here I help you up. You ok? Yes? Good! You want blowjob for 600 koruna??” ($30 US dollars) She made a move to grab my groin, and I instantly started laughing my ass off! This woman was the same age as my grandmother. Through hysterical laughter, I thanked her for her offer, but all I needed was a bathroom. I limped off cracking up to rejoin my group.
The girls went home early, but Kevin, Chris and I stayed to hit up the last spot on the pub crawl. It’s a massive club on the top floor of a 20-story building, accessed by elevator, affording an amazing view of Wenceslas Square, Prague’s central square steeped in history. I was having fun dancing under the massive crystal disco ball, but it was getting late and we were all running out of money. We cabbed it home and crashed.
The next day, Chris and I went in search of a supposed beer garden, but were disappointed to find a small café in some park. Beer garden my ass. Nevertheless, we sipped on some lagers and hung out all afternoon in the newfound coolness that had descended over the city. I headed off to grab dinner, and met up with everyone again later on at the hostel. We were all pretty beat from the pub crawl the night before, and since I wanted to be fresh for Berlin the next day, we decided to have a chill night (oh how wrong would I be in the end of this disaster). We headed over the river via metro to a local movie theater. The girls went and saw some more of that Twilight garbage, and Chris and I caught the new Predators movie, completely dubbed in Czech.
After the movies, we were supposed to meet in the lobby and head home together, but the girls were nowhere to be found. It was roughly 11:45 pm, so we walked all over this megaplex looking for them. Yep, they left us. After spending 20 minutes looking for them, we headed to the metro, but learned we had missed the last train of the day by five minutes! We had to head back up to the streets, and walk over the bridge to the other side of the river to catch a tram… in the now pouring rain. Upon arrival, we learned our usual tram had also stopped running, so we had to make an educated guess as to which of the night trams went past our hostel. We guessed very wrong, as after 20 minutes, we ended up in the Prague projects at the very last stop on the southeast part of town, at which point the tram driver kicked us out into the rain. Bewildered, defeated, and moody, we had to wait 45 minutes for another to come along. We figured we had just taken this tram in the wrong direction, since we both had an inclination that this was indeed the correct line. Finally, the tram arrived, and we rode it… all the way to the other end point on the complete other northwest side of town without finding our stop! Angered, we started asking everyone we could, but suddenly no one spoke English. We now realized we had to get on another line, so we rode this damn tram again in the southeast direction, but got off to catch a connecting train which we hoped was going in the right direction. It paid off because we finally found the hostel… after literally seeing the entire city! We left that movie theater at midnight; we arrived at our hostel at 3:20 am.
Long story short, I got four hours of sleep… again! Now I’m on the train to Berlin, my last real destination before heading back to Amsterdam for a single night before catching my flight home and ending this odyssey. I am quite conflicted at this point; I’d love to keep travelling indefinitely, but I can feel my body can’t go much further. I’m excited to go home and see everyone, to have ice cold beer, to lie in my bed with the History channel lulling me to sleep (as opposed to 12 drunks in my hostel room), to lift weights, to drive my car or make a call on my cell phone. I have four days left, but you can be assured I will make the best of them! Besides, my next hostel has a pool on the roof!

Prof. Jürgen Kocka spoke in Prague on Germany’s complex remembrance culture, addressing Nazi crimes, Germans as victims, expulsion, and the rise of populism. His reflections offer timely lessons for democracy.
On May 13, 2025, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic hosted one of the most distinguished German historians of our time, Prof. Jürgen Kocka. In a packed lecture hall at Národní 3, Prague, an audience of scholars, students, and interested citizens listened to his lecture: “Memory, Conflict and Research. Dealing with a Difficult Past.” This event was organized by the Collegium Carolinum, the German Historical Institute Warsaw, and the Leibniz Institute for History and Culture of Eastern Europe.
Prof. Kocka, born 1941 in Hejnice (Haindorf), northern Bohemia, expelled as a child, is uniquely positioned to reflect on the interwoven German and Central European histories. His academic journey led him to Bielefeld, Berlin, UCLA, and his research has shaped the international discourse on modern and social history.
The lecture offered a sweeping analysis of how Germany has dealt with its difficult 20th-century past, the Nazi dictatorship, its crimes, and the legacy of flight and expulsion in the aftermath of World War II. Kocka clearly distinguished between the Federal Republic and the GDR in their contrasting approaches to the Nazi past. While the West pursued a painful, slow, and self-critical confrontation, the East projected the Nazi past as a capitalist aberration, distancing its socialist present from any guilt.
“Commemoration becomes more abstract, less concrete, more institutionalized, more routinized”
Prof. Kocka observed, highlighting the challenges faced by younger generations in maintaining a vivid connection to the past. The second part of his lecture focused on Germans as victims -specifically, the millions who suffered flight and expulsion. Kocka underlined how difficult and politically charged this topic remained for decades, as many expellee organizations mixed legitimate memory with territorial claims. Only after 1990, with the definitive recognition of Germany’s eastern borders, could reconciliation with the neighbor countries and a more open remembrance culture develop.
Kocka gave special mention to the growing role of museums and local remembrance initiatives, such as the Isergebirgsmuseum in Bavaria, that now foster dialogue across former national divides.
However, his most thought-provoking section addressed recent shifts. In recent years, Germany has faced the rise of right-wing populism, symbolized by the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).
“AfD speakers have demanded a 180-degree reversal of the course of our historical culture.”
Kocka warned, that AfD tries to play down the importance of the Nazi dictatorship and describe it as a minimal and excusable aberration, as a piece of foolishness.
At this point, I would like to add my personal comment. While I fully understand Prof. Kocka’s analytical caution, I believe the rise of the AfD also reflects deeper dissatisfaction in parts of society. In both East and West Germany, many people feel that the traditional parties have lost touch with the everyday concerns of their voters. The growing appeal of populists is not only about historical memory, but also about social frustration.
There is a Czech proverb that captures this dynamic very well:
“Kdo seje vítr, sklízí bouři”
“He who sows the wind shall reap the storm.”
Germany, a country that has had bitter experience with the consequences of political radicalization, should not forget that social alienation can undermine even the strongest democratic values.
This makes it all the more important for academic voices and civil society to remain vigilant, proactive, and open to dialogue across political and social divides. Only by understanding the roots of discontent can democratic institutions regain trust and legitimacy. In this sense, I am convinced that contributions like the one from Prof. Kocka are more important than ever.
As a researcher in the field of heritage language and collective memory, I see interesting parallels. Just as the third generation often loses the linguistic link to its ancestors , as my research on heritage language in the Riesengebirge shows , there seems to be a fading awareness of the historical foundations of Germany’s democratic consensus. This makes active remembrance work, both local and transnational, indispensable.
“Historians are better in describing and explaining the past than in predicting the future.”
Prof. Kocka concluded, offering a thoughtful reflection on the continuing challenges ahead. I would like to thank Prof. Kocka, the organizers, and the many participants who made this event in Prague a memorable intellectual exchange. It was a valuable contribution to a highly relevant, ongoing debate.

The mix of design, business and IT was very welcome. I learned most from talks outside my own area of expertise. That’s also what attracts me in interaction design: talking with clients and users, and learning new things from different subjects. I talked with everybody in the conference, from the speakers to the guy making the tea. The conference had a very open and relaxed atmosphere and there were several cool things besides the talks such as: 3d printing, Google Glass, and even a professional masseur. Another neat idea was the discomfort zone, where people were allowed to debate freely and play devils advocate without consequences. Also great were the after-conference parties and events. Sadly, the design workshop on Thursday didn’t happen due to lack of attendees.
The quality of the talks was very good overall. But it seemed that every design or business presentation has lists of “ideas”, “key takeaways”, “guidelines” or “insights’. A lot of them seemed trivial or made up on the spot (“listen to your users”, really?). It would have been better for most talks to stick to one message! Now, I’ll break that rule straight away and present some take-aways :)
Marli Mesbov gave a great presentation on the importance of story telling. Stories work better than short tag lines, which is probably related to Key Take Away 1 (no take-aways).
Stories work for conversion and for your clients to positively remember you. Do you remember the fairytale of the boy who cried wolf? Don’t you think that carries the message better than “don’t alarm us for nothing”? The average attention span went down from 12 seconds in 2000 to a mere 8 seconds in 2012, so better make your story captivating!
Besides working on your site, stories also work great for doing design. It’s an old saying, but still good advice: instead of designing for users, design for a story.
Lastly, a story can be used to instruct a client on how to use the website. Instead of delivering a 100 page styleguide which people don’t read, you can make a short story, a trailer or just a word (“dictionary”, “phonebook”), which ‘explains’ the site to the client.
It was great to hear some self-conscious critique on terms we use within the field. Our terms are confusing and their meaning differs per person and company: UX, service design and even interaction design (but less). Some people include visual design in there, programming, marketing… All very confusing! And what to think of terms like ‘expert’ or ‘guru’? Instead, it’s better to describe what you do and how it benefits the client or project.
Bad user experience costs money, which is what we tell our clients also But it was great to see some examples, such as Expedia losing 12 million dollar because of a form field or Best Buy losing 300 million dollar by requiring an unnecessary login. This holds especially for mobile use: a lot of apps are used only once or thrown away within a month. Avi Itzkovitch had some nice examples how to overcome such bad experience by making more use of context. For instance by adapting the interface based on location, time of day or usage pattern.
I wish it could be a wholehearted yes! I had a lot of fun, met great people and learned a lot, but… Some things nagged a bit, like the cancelled design workshop, the open doors in some design talks and the endless lists of recommendations. Another thing is the overlap in the program: breaks were different for each track making it difficult to switch. That might be why designers mostly went to the design track and programmers to the development tracks, making the mingling a lot less. On top of that, all speakers were “safe choices”, nobody went really overboard or crazy with some thought-provoking talk. Still, it was fun and I learned useful things, so, I guess it’s four out of five stars. For a visual impression, see the Facebook photostream
Webexpo puts the talks online (very slowly), so which ones should you see?

I’ve been to Prague several times, for both professional and personal reasons. My last visit was just last week. Over the years, I’ve seen how overtourism has taken its toll on the city—especially with crowds of loud, drunken young tourists. But this time, for some reason, the streets were much quieter, with only a few visitors around. For the first time, I felt like I could truly see the city.

Military time should only be used in the military, and definitely not in train stations where there are analog clocks everywhere. That makes no sense. That would be like if you went to a 3D movie and instead of glasses they gave everyone a potato with a hole in it.
Why bring arithmetic into the equation? Who doesn’t understand the am/pm system? Kids even get it. So why turn the thing into a goddamn Zodiac cypher? 20:00 should be 10:00pm. It’s an optical illusion and very unfair.
Anyway, I missed my 10pm train from Paris to Prague.
Eventually, after sleeping on the ground, I got on the 11am train. Luckily, the booze shops were open by then, so I was able to grab whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. I also grabbed another baguette and some candy for the road. I didn’t need much on account of the Adderall in my system.
The cabin was a shared one, for 4 people. It was the size of a closet and barely fit two bunk beds. Only one person could stand at a time. It was extremely tiny.
The four of us tried to introduce ourselves to one another but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. We couldn’t communicate verbally no matter how hard we tried. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
About an hour in though, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew I’d bought in Paris. The cork made a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling. I motioned to the bottle and made the universal sign for drinking, “Eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
“I’ll be right back,” I told them.
I went to the bar cart and asked for four cups. Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting into my bed. One at a time, they stood to get their serving, like I was giving them communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within 2 hours we were all drunk and having the times of our lives.
We took turns telling stories in our own language without even caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love miming in France and we were still technically within the border) and facial expressions were all we needed. Words, as usual, were unnecessary.
When my turn came around I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting while vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. When I got to the drain mashing part they all gasped before breaking out into a chorus of laughter. There we were, four guys who barely knew each other’s names, acting like lifelong friends. I was so grateful to experience that warmth on what would have otherwise been a very lonely ride for me. I was missing my friends. I was missing Meghan. I was missing home, wherever that was.
The guys and I all had transfers we needed to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train. Or maybe it was the second transfer I screwed up, I can’t remember. Either way, I ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station. It was a rural area, and it was 2:00 am. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After about 10 minutes I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a maniac. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before.
Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel”. They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer?
I didn’t know where they were driving me. I hoped to my hostel. After 10 minutes, they stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis in it. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. When I got out of the car I bowed to them.
I hopped in the cab, and showed the driver the address of the hostel. He had me there in 15 minutes.
I had booked a shared room at “Hostel One Prague”. Again, it wasn’t the nicest of hostels, but it did have a bar. In fact, the bar was downstairs, in a cave. When I checked in there were people still drinking, so I joined them.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish guy named Simon. That accent everyone can tell. He was all of 5'7'’, 180 lbs, most of which was in his robust belly. He had a punk style along with the mohawk to match, even though he appeared to be in his late thirties. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm about him. I could tell he was a lifelong degenerate.
“How the fuck are ya, mate? Welcome. You need a drink.”
“I certainly do.”
“Why you checking in so late? It’s 2:30am.”
“Long story.”
“This is Caroline,” he said pointing to the other girl at the table. “She can drink.”
Caroline, I’d later come to learn was from Australia, and on “holiday”. The whole world takes holidays except for Americans. We take vacations. Much lamer. Also, the Australian government pays for their holidays, which blew my mind at the time. Caroline was reserved. Some might call her overweight, but I wouldn’t. She had long brown hair and bangs that layed atop her eyebrows. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. I thought she was pretty.
“Hello Caroline, hello Simon. I’m Sam.”
“Fuck that. You’re Johnny McEnroe,” Simon asserted.
“You think I look like John McEnroe?”
“It’s your vibe. You’re John McEnroe. Isn’t he Caroline?”
“I don’t see it,” she said.
“He’s Johnny Mac, and that’s final.”
We drank a few beers, then headed to bed at 4:30am. When I woke up around 1pm (13:00? I’m just practicing) breakfast was already laid out in the kitchen. It was a nice spread of eggs, toast, crispy potatoes, and fruit. Simon, Caroline, and a few others were already sitting and eating. I pulled up a chair.
“Caroline made breakfast,” Simon said. “No blood pudding but it’ll do. Come on sit down, have some.”
“May I, Caroline?”
“You may,” she said, laughing at my manners. “What’s mine is yours.”
I sat down and made a plate. I was impressed by the quality of the scrambled eggs, and the crispiness of the potatoes. Caroline clearly knew how to cook.
“I’m going to a bookstore today. You want to come with?” She asked. “Simon won’t go.”
“Fucking libraries, absolute shite. Beer is only 10 Krunas here, I’m going to drink all day.” Everything was cheap in Prague because they had yet to join the European Union and adopt the Euro. I shit you not, 24 beers cost 3 Euros at the store. Then, if you brought the bottles back they’d give you a Euro’s worth of their money (Korunas). It was an outrageous deal.
“I think she said it was a bookstore,” I said, thinking Simon had made an honest mistake.”
“It’s all the same Shite, Johnny Mac.”
“I see we’re still doing this?”
“Doing what? You are Johhny Mac. You don’t like it?”
“No, I like it. Feel free.”
“Good.”
After breakfast, Caroline and I headed out for the bookstore. We walked through a beautiful square that I don’t remember the name of, before stopping in a chocolate shop. I don’t eat chocolate normally, but I did that day, and it was delicious. When we got to the bookstore there was a long wait outside.
“There must be a book signing,” I said confidently.
“No, the line is because they only let a certain amount of people in at a time,” she said, correcting me.
It took forever to get in the bookstore, but when we did, I felt like a VIP. There were probably only 100 of us in the massive shop, and each one of us felt special.
Neither of us bought a book, but we did show each other our favorites. When I showed her Atlas Shrugged I asked if she had read it.
“Of course,” she said, in a way that implied everyone has read it.
“I’m on page 875,” I told her.
“I won’t ruin it for you, but I loved it.”
Now I was smitten. If she liked Dagny Taggert (the protagonist in the book), she was good enough for me.
Walking back to the hostel, I felt sparks. We didn’t hold hands but we walked a lot closer to each other than we did before. Both of us were relaxed, something I hadn’t felt in weeks. It was a delightful walk.
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself.
“How was the library, ya wanker fucks?”
His manner of speaking didn’t bother me or Caroline, who seemed even chiller than me.
“Jesus, Simon. You swear a lot.” I said.
“Fuck then, go on. Or sit down and have a damn drink with me.”
After a few rounds we decided to go to a bar down the street. I hadn’t been to a local Prague bar yet and figured this might be my only chance because I planned to leave for Berlin the next day. A city can be best understood by drinking whatever the bartender puts in front of you at a local bar.
I immediately loved the place as soon as I walked in. There were only five people there and the youngest person appeared to be 70 years old. The group of men were sitting at a table. It was not a table you’d normally find in a bar, rather it was a dining table. They didn’t even serve food there but each table in the place (there were 4 ), seated 6 people. At the bar there were a few more seats but that is about it. No one spoke English, or at least they didn’t show us they did.
The walls were wooden, like the ones you’d find in an Elks Lodge. On them hung pictures of soldiers in uniform. The bar itself was a classic one, like you’d find in America. I didn’t see any liquor on the shelves either. Only beer was served there.
When we sat down, the bartender brought us 3 lagers from a tap. He was a gruff man, about 80 years old. I’d never seen a bartender his age. He was half-drunk too, but still in control of his motor skills.
I put down triple the amount we were charged for our drinks and pointed over to the table in the corner. The bartender said something in Czech and pointed to me. The men cheered and smiled in my direction. Then, one by one they got up to shake my hand.
“Sam,” I said, pointing to myself.
“Caroline,” she said, pointing to herself.
“Simon, me’ name is Simon,” he said, not pointing at himself,.
We had a lot of beers that night, maybe 7 a piece. It cost around 10 dollars for our entire tab. Again, I left triple for my portion. That’s what gentlemen do. It was well worth it.
Caroline and I held hands on the short walk back to our hostel. We both wanted companionship that night and holding hands was the perfect medicine for that.
“Ahh, fuck off you two,” yelled Simon, as he turned around and caught a quick glimpse of us. I guess you’re coming to Slovakia with us now.”
“Slovakia?” I asked, looking at Caroline.
“We’re taking a bus to Bratislava tomorrow. Wanna come?”
“Bratislava? A bus?”
“Yeah, it’ll be fun. You should come,” Caroline said.
That’s all it took for me.
“I’m down.”
“Fuck yeah, Johhny Mac!”

Anthony Bourdain had an uncanny ability to portray the essence of a place. His introductory monologues were so freaking inspiring and something I’ll forever attempt to emulate. How the hell can you capture the energy of a city in words?
They’re such unique, ever-changing, and living expressions of society, culture, and time. And they all feel different. San Fransisco is not Paris which is not Kuala Lumpur or Beijing or Casablanca. Each has its own vibe that emanates from the shape and warmth of its street lights, the hush of the tide, the signs in the shop windows, the tables in the plazas, the smell wafting from restaurants or street vendors, the hum of scooters, the ringing of bicycle bells, the billboards, and the different eras of architecture that show the decades and centuries stacked over each other.
It is much easier to get all that with the audio and visuals of film. To express it all with words alone is a tall task.
But it is something I’ve been thinking about undertaking. Could I ever begin to do Prague justice? No, but I can try.
What is it like to live here in 2022?

November 22, or something like that.
Lovely cafe in which I do not know the name,next to another European clock towerand a bell that strikes upon the hourtick tick ticking away the seconds that make upEvy and I drinking lattes and eating cakes in a foreign place.
Wandering along the slippery cobblestone path, an indulgence, a tiresome dancebetween coffee and beer and long mornings sleeping withthe cold aircoming in through the window.
This place has decorative tiles, imperfect concrete walls supporting high ceilingsabstract paintings for the contemplation of the consumerthe ponderings of an American who can’t sit still obsessing over the future,reading Eckhart Tolle to cease the dwell.
Is it possible, to be all that I wish to beto live out the stories I tellin my mind, the visions of a lifeexisting in a raindrop of time.
Tis a compulsion to live almost exclusivelythrough memory and anticipation.

Two perfect days in April: my book launches in Prague and the Netherlands,https://medium.com/@Eline_Vedder/two-perfect-days-in-april-my-book-launches-in-prague-and-the-netherlands-8316595dd293,"Sign up

When the audience gets involved: events, interviews, videos, and book talk
In this article, I will cover two perfect days in April. 12 April: Book launch in Diemen, the Netherlands. 26 April: book launch in Prague.
It was the perfect day for my book launch; the cherry blossoms bloomed. Spring was palpable. The book signing took place at the local bookstore. We arranged coffee, cakes with the book cover on them, balloons, my lucky pencil, and of course, the books.
The local newspaper announced the signing. Read it here (it’s in Dutch). The article is about the book and my reason for writing it, my choice of leaving Amsterdam to move to Prague, traveling, writing in English, and daydreaming.
“I knew early on that I didn’t want to stay in the place I grew up and knew well.I wanted to gain new impressions and reinvent myself.” — Eline Vedder
Friends and family were there, and people I had not seen for eight years. They had read it in the newspaper. They bought the novel with them or brought it from the bookstore. I signed their copies and added a personal note. Something I knew they would like in the book, something that would resonate with them.
Strangers visited the store, too. Some passed the store and were curious. I told them about Nora’s story (the main character in Sitting Next to a Stranger) and my love for writing. We talked about books, traveling, self-publishing, creating art, and following your dreams.
Check the reel below:

A post shared by @eline.vedder
How books surprise usWhen I started writing the book, I thought it was about meeting strangers and summarizing the lessons we learn from each other. The book surprised me when I wrote it. It turned out to be about strangers, but more so, about finding a connection, friendship, and love. About art, traveling, and stepping away from your protective upbringing. About getting into the beautiful world. About daring to leave. Your place, your relationship, your old self. It’s about removing the labels you put on yourself. The characters in the book taught me everything I needed to know about these topics.
I still have to get used to the idea that my book stands on people’s shelves. People will enter the world I wrote down and go on a journey with my characters. I’m curious to hear what the readers will pick up from the book. Which topics and lessons will stand out for them? What will they find in the story?
“Like Nora, I used to go to the Museum Square and look at the Van Gogh Museum. I drew some of my first paintings there.”
“My son lives and works in Guatemala. I will give him Sitting Next to a Stranger once I finish.”
“I am an anthropologist and have traveled through Mexico. Can’t wait to see how you fictionalized this country.”
Saturday 26th April. 16.00/4 pm. Prague — I enter a calm garden in the city center. The sky is blue, and the weather is perfect after four days of rain. I place three journals on display. They are the original manuscript of my just-published novel, Sitting Next to a Stranger. I am setting up a small exhibition while I wait for my nerves to calm down and for the guests to arrive.
16.59/4.59 pm — My friends Gabriele, Andrew, Miko, and Cortney transformed the garden into a magical place. They hang all the balloons and posters and put everything in the perfect spot. They tell me that it’s going to be fine.
“It will all go smoothly, you can enjoy your achievement,” they all say in their own words.
“OK, I think you’re right,” I reply. My voice is quivering, and my eyes scan the garden. I realize how perfect it is, how grateful I am that we can make this day happen. How important it is to celebrate creative endeavors. The sun warms my face, and I start to believe it: I can do this, I’m the author. I know my novel, and I can answer every question. I trust my art and myself.
I run to the tables on the terrace. The people don’t know anything about this event. “Hey,” I say. “I’m celebrating my book. We don’t know each other, but you are invited.” They wish me good luck and adjust their seats so they can see what we are about to start. We are about to start the most magical three hours. This event is all I dreamed of. I’m still flabbergasted that I pulled this off, but I have envisioned this for the last three years. Is this manifesting?
Text continues
“I met you three years ago, when you told me you wanted to write a book. I’m so happy I can be part of this celebration.”
“I love the cover, the title is catchy.”
“I don’t read a lot, but my girlfriend does. She will love this book.”
“I’m lost in life, I need to figure out what I want.”
I reply: “This is the perfect moment for you to read this book. It won’t answer your question of where to go in your life, but it will make you gentle with yourself.”
“I have been to Mexico too, I can’t wait to ‘travel’ back to it.”
“I need something lighthearted.”
“I heard your interview, I want to read Nora’s story.”
You can find the full 36-minute Q&A on YouTube. Read the questions and my answers in my other Substack post.
My biggest takeaways from these events:
Writing is, first and foremost, something I do for myself. I want to spend my days thinking about scenes, characters, and books. I wrote this book because I had to; I wrote it for my 21-year-old self. The best mindspace was when I wasn’t even sure if I’d publish it.
Now, the audience is involved, and my book is out in the world. It’s there for you. Be surprised and have fun on this trip in Mexico and within yourself.
I’m always down for a book chat!
Thank you to everyone who showed up 💙✨

With Love,

Prague is a city of magic and mystery. Here’s a 100-word story I wrote based on a magical, mysterious moment one night in Prague.
After way too many beers, I stagger through Prague’s Old Town. It’s cold and the night sky is clear. I round a corner and see Kafka scratching his name on parked BMWs and scribbling license plate numbers in his notebook. He’s no doubt creating a new story of old Prague where Scodas turn themselves into BMWs while sleeping at night. I want to say hello, shake his hand, but when I approach him, he disappears into an alley. I follow him but the alley is narrow and too dark for me to see even with a full cold moon above.

What’s the first thing after landing? It’s definitely searching how to go to the city.
From London and Stansted Airport, the airport express ticket is about 20 GBP (24 EUR). Then guess how much the airport express bus ticket in Prague costs? It is 100 CZK (4 EUR). It is ONLY one-sixth! My price made my trip have a good beginning.
The public transportation system in Prague is well designed. The tickets are on time bases (eg. 30 mins, 45 mins). With the ticket, you can access all public transport (except airport express), including trams, buses, and the metro. The ticket vending machine can be found at the metro station.
Besides the tourist spots, you also can find the historical atmosphere in the entire city. Every corner of the city shows its special stories. From the bridge, castles, to the stores, none of them let me down.
The beauty of the city shines especially during sunset. The sunshine covers the roofs and makes the city even more orange. My friend and I enjoyed the sunset view at the castle, which is on the hill. There is no word able to describe how stunning it was.
Prague is a special capital. The city is full of stories. For example, it is where the Defenestration of Prague happened, which leads to the Thirty Years’ War. Now you can see how important a role Prague plays in history. If you are interested in European history, Prague definitely drives you crazy.
Same as in many touristy areas, the prices in the center of Prague are also “touristy.” My friend and I, luckily, found a local café with a cozy environment and affordable price. It is called Sladká Cesta Caffé.
There are various cakes and pies. The price is about 80–100 CZK. According to my friend, who studies in Germany, some desserts are also common in Germany.
Chill time! Sitting in the café, enjoying the desserts, and watching the passengers on the streets.
Kürtőskalács (Trdelník) 煙囪卷
There are tremendous trdelník stores on the street. The price is about 70 CZK without ice cream and 130 CZK with ice cream.
The root of this word, trdlo, is the name of the wooden tool the cake ingredients are wrapped around during cooking.
In my opinion, ice cream is not necessary. Ice cream covers the flavor of the bread and makes the pastry too sweet. The crispy hot bread with spread is just right!
Prague Ham
Near the Old Town Square, some food stands sell Prague ham.
It is tasty and juicy, but it is not affordable. The price is based on the weight of the ham. I would suggest you have someone and share it together if you want to give it a try.
Different from other tourists, we are really looking forward to something natural and special.
We used to plan to visit Bohemian, which takes 2 hours by train from Prague, but it would make the schedule too tense. After discussion, we decided to go to a natural park called Dioká Šárka in the countryside.
It is at the final station of tram no. 26. The entrance of the park is right next to the station. The park is easily accessible from the city. It takes about 30 mins by tram from the city center.
Unfortunately, it was not warm enough when we visited the park. There were rarely leaves. When the spring comes, the entire park is going to be amazing and really good for picnics.
There are several routes. You can walk by the river or go hiking. Trees, rivers, birds, and hills. The views can definitely purify your mind and help you stay away from annoying things.
Look at the picture below. Can you imagine how beautiful the park is going to be? Don’t miss the park when you visit Prague.
The international stamps (Z stamps) sold in Prague are the most beautiful I have ever seen!
The price for each international stamp is 45 CZK. Compared with other European countries, the price is relatively affordable.
BTW, the post office in Prague is also beautiful and spacious. If you want to send the postcards, find Česká Pošta near the train station.

I can mean this in the most basic way possible, of course. Stepping off the plane, I was an eighteen year old baby. Now, I’m twenty-one (and still a baby). I’ve finished uni, gotten into a relationship, and made lifelong friends from people around the world. I’ve lived in two different flats in Prague, with vastly different situations. My style has changed more times than I can count on my two hands.
But, as I was telling my mom, it feels like I’m leaving a friend. I never experienced Prague like the big packs of British guys coming for a stag do or the backpacking groups that are here for a long weekend before they bounce off somewhere else.
I don’t relate to the videos fawning over Duplex or the five story club of Karlovy Lazne. The Charles Bridge and Old Town Square became a route I would only walk through out of pure necessity, a scene I should’ve never taken for granted.
The Prague that I know is the sun setting over Žižkov on the rooftop of my friends’ apartment, sharing a bottle of white wine, a pack of cigarettes, and some hummus from Albert.

Jozef is a Slovakian living in Prague. Although he joined our team only half a year ago, it almost feels like he’s been here forever. He always has a plan, knows his way around all things design, and is the best man for any type of ideation. Jozef also hates discovering new places alone and apparently loves vodka.
What do you do?
I’m a product designer.
And I mean, what do you really do all day?
My days really differ according to which phase of a product we are working on. So, it can range from sketching user flows/stories, testing ideas, prototyping, working on visuals or preparing exports for dev guys — very colorful.
What keeps you motivated?
People I am working with ‘cause they’re really good at what they do, so I can learn from them and get inspired. And also our users. It’s really motivating and challenging to design something people like using.
What’s your song of the day?
I don’t have one. Recently, I started to love my spotify discover or some indie mixes.
What’s been the most recent life lesson?
I read few articles that the tech industry is about to change massively in the next decade. For me it means we should never stop exploring the unknown. For example, I seriously started to learn how to code but it’s going really slowly.
What are your all-time favourites? Any underrated or classic TV-shows, books, music you would like to share?
I really love the email digest and newsletters I receive. Just to mention few I rely on — Sidebar, Medium digest, UX daily and so on. I also watch series on Netflix and cooking videos on Youtube. And last but not least I recently bought some books about typography and a few posters.
Describe the scariest moment of your life.
The scariest one was definitely when I had a car accident with my friends. It happened so quickly. The car was totally crushed but luckily nobody was seriously injured. Before the crash I loved speed and extreme sports. Since then I am totally the opposite. This kind of thing changes you forever.
What are the five things you’d take to a desert island?
A bottle, swiss knife, matches, vodka and some book about how to survive on a desert island.
What do you wish you had known 5 years ago?
That being yourself is just what matters the most.
One thing you really like about your job and another you don’t like that much?
I really like that I can be independent and at the same time responsible. It kind of makes me feel I’m working on my own thing which is very important to me. On the other hand, I don’t like being without the team from time to time. But we meet up in almost every 3 months, so it’s not that bad.
What’s your one big dream or life goal?
Being totally independent in terms of everything like money and schedule. Just waking up and doing what I want.
What are your most recent discoveries? Any tv-shows podcasts, blogs, books we should keep our eyes on?
Treehouse — really cool site regarding how to learn code.
What are you really grateful of today?
That I woke up today.
The blog posts are a part of our ongoing campaign demonstrating the merits of gratitude. Join the campaign and check out other entries! 💚

I spent this summer travelling around Europe and nowhere quite captured my attention and gave me that “I never want to leave” feeling as Prague.
From its incredible architecture to its pumping night life, I was lucky enough to have a good friend show me around the city for four days. If you could spare only a weekend or a whole lifetime this fairy tale hot spot would still never fail to entice and surprise.

My first trip to Prague was in 2015, and I have been living in Prague almost for a year now. Considering the touristic season is already here (it was more than 20 degrees whole week!), I thought I should better create a post answering questions that I get from friends about visiting Prague and share the places I visited for the last 3 years with you all.
This post is ideal if you are planning to visit Prague for a short amount of time (more than a day, less than a month) and want to visit the key places of the city according to my experience. The post is not giving clear transportation methods (how long it takes from A to B, which trams go there etc), and only intends to initiate a list of places that I find worth visiting at your first Prague trip.
Prague has a beautiful Old Town (Staré Mesto) and it is a perfect place to start your trip. There you can see the Prague Astronomical Clock (currently being renovated until August 2018) which is the oldest functioning astronomical clock in the world. You will find its place in old town by just joining the always-waiting tourist groups in front of the clock because every hour twelve apostles appear from small windows of the clock. This parade takes almost a minute and is definitely worth watching. If you want to read more about the figures and the apostles of the clock, read here.
After you walked around the Old Town, you can move to Charles Bridge (Karlův most) which is one of the bridges that crosses the Vltava River. The historical bridge hosts 30 sculptures and sculpture groups on its walls. Although it is the most crowded place in the daytime due to the heavy interest of tourists, you would not want to miss the view from the bridge and the daylight look on the sculptures. I recommend visiting the bridge again in the evening to experience the charming lit version of the bridge and the beautiful city under the evening lights one more time.
From the Charles Bridge you can connect to Kampa Island. There is a little channel called Čertovka (Devil’s Channel) with an old mill (not functioning anymore). Around the old mild there is a Vodník (can be translated as Water Demon) sitting and watching for the possible souls to store in porcelain bottles* :) At the same time, this happens to be my favourite part of Kampa Island. Also, there is a restaurant next to the mill, and it has a cute balcony and two tables outside, by looking to it I always think it can be good choice for a romantic dinner ❤
* In Czech folklore, it is believed that evil vodníci (plural of vodník) try to drown people when they happen to swim in their territory and store the souls of the drowned in porcelain bottles.
From the little channel bridge, you can walk to John Lennon Wall. In my opinion, currently it looks like more of a name+surname wall of the people who sprayed their names onto the wall, but it should be seen for the worthy cause of the wall, against wars, and inspired by John Lennon’s peaceful acts.
Kampa Park is very pretty in the spring, a must-see for visitors in summer. You can see bronze statues of three crawling babies*, by the Czech sculptor David Černý and have some photos with them like I did :) The sculptor is known as a controversial artist and you can find his installations at many different spots in Prague. For example, he is the artist behind the famous Head of Franz Kafka and Man Hanging Out; the man in the subject is Sigmund Freud who was born in Moravia, depicted as hanging by one hand not sure if to hold onto or let go.
* There is an ugly TV tower in Prague and some of the crawling babies added on it to make it a bit prettier. If you happen to visit TV tower area, you can see the crawling babies climbing to the tower :) The babies that climb to the tower are made from fiberglass, a bit lighter than their bronze siblings at Kampa Park :)
While you are at Kampa Island, you can visit Museum Kampa, one of the many modern art museums in Prague. I haven’t visited the museum myself but it is on my to-do list. You should find Kampa’s yellow penguins as they are pretty cute and don’t forget to check them again in the evening because they are also lit!
Another must-see place, and also very popular by all tourists, is Prague Castle (Pražský hrad). The castle complex is really big and considered the largest ancient castle in the world and St. Vitus Cathedral is situated within the complex. You can also get one of the best views of Prague from the walls surrounding the castle complex. I am known to take more photos whenever we visit the castle area with our guests who visit the castle for the first time :)
But what I like the most about the castle is the surrounding gardens. Awesomely designed gardens make spring/summer or for that matter any good weather trip worthwhile! Currently, as you can see at the first photo of the post, spring is very inviting, and the castle gardens are full of nice trees, flowers and awaking greens ❤ You can check all the gardens listed here: https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle-for-visitors/gardens
Talking about castles and nice weathers, I also recommend visiting Vyšehrad (means upper castle in Czech). From Vyšehrad, you can get an amazing river view one which you can’t get from Prague Castle. Probably by now, you already know that I can get very excited about city gardens, and as expected from me, I very much liked Vyšehrad gardens, too ❤
Prague is full of parks and gardens, and I am very grateful that I am living in a city that everybody can access the green areas easily! We (me and my husband) are living in Vinohrady (means vineyards in Czech) and the closest park to us is Grébovka. As declared in the name of Vinohrady, Grébovka also has one remaining vineyard from the many historical vineyards once covered all park area in the 14th century. The vineyard has a cute wooden gazebo restaurant & wine bar where they can also have weddings :) And my favourite part of the vineyard is that it also has a winery where you can get the wine of the same vineyard ❤
In my opinion, Grébovka is the most romantic park in Prague and we enjoy our evening walks (even more romantic, thanks to the authentic street lamps of Prague ❤) there. If you’re staying in the same area, I recommend checking this park as well, if you like daylight park visits more, picnic season is already open!
Up until now, I listed almost all the basic touristic must-see places in Prague. If your trip is 2–3 days long, you possibly have enough places to discover in the city. But if you are more like nature-lover type and prefer doing outdoor activities maybe you can also check the nature parks I enjoyed visiting.
Divoká Šárka (Wild Šárka) is a nature reserve and named after a female mythological warrior Šárka. There is a small canyon in the park, and it is pretty good for trekking. As a plus, you can also have a nice view after you climb the hill. It is a perfect place for enjoying nature in Prague without getting too far* from the city.
* From where we live, it takes about an hour to get there, but it totally worths the effort.
Stromovka is a very beautiful and large park. It was established in the 13th century as a game reserve and converted into a park later in 19th century. The park has a style of an English landscape garden, and there is a pond that I liked very much spending time around it.
Prokopské údolí (Prokop Valley) is an amazing place to see and from where we live it takes almost the same time as Šárka to go there. There are two small rivers, a beautiful lake, and a natural reserve area. There are playgrounds for children and benches to rest if you want to have a rest. When we first visited the area, I fell in love with nature there, and I want to visit as much as possible this year.
These are all my favourite outdoor spaces so far and let me know if you can suggest some more for me to visit this year!
Before we finalise the post, I want to mention two places I saw families with kids enjoying their time there, and you might want to add these places to your travel plan if you have children.
Disclaimer: We don’t have a child so that I don’t have a personal experience in any of the places that I recommend from a child-friendly view. I just thought it might give some ideas to the guests with kids.
Prague Zoo is a very good place to visit, even if you are not a child nor have a child :) But I highly recommend, if you have a child ❤ The admission price for a family of 4 (2 parents + 2 children) is 600 CZK (about 24 EUR — April 2018). I usually have mixed feelings about the zoos but this one does not feel like an animal prison, instead, the animals have a lot of space, they wander seemingly freely and inspire kids to learn about them in a natural looking and feeling setup. When I visited the zoo in 2015, I thought except polar animals all animals are doing fine, but the condition of polar animals did not seem enough to me to support them in Prague hot summer :(
I know, Prague Zoo was seriously damaged when the flood hit the city in 2002, and hope the animals will get better treatment after the flood’s effects completely reverted.
My second suggestion for families with kids would be visiting Mořský svět (Sea World) Aquarium. It was relatively small and boring for adults but kids were having a lot of fun there when we visited the aquarium in 2016. The ticket price for a family of four is 850 CZK (about 34 EUR — April 2018).
Overall, I think Prague is an enchanting city with its different styles of architecture from the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque era. Dark towers, colourful and unique style of historical buildings, doors, windows, bridges, and cobblestone streets (unpack those high heels now!) carries the memories of a long eventful history. Prague also offers a great deal of green within the city with parks and natural areas. I think everyone can find a reason to love Prague and bring good memories back to home, or maybe make it their new home ❤

The first time I travelled to the Czech Republic was in the early 1990s. Communism was collapsing and, despite the obvious scars of decades of oppression, there was hope in the air. Modern and democratically leaning, Czechia (yes it’s really called that now) along with Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia (or the Visegrad Group) showed promise in bridging the East-West divide. I’ve travelled back many times since, happily noting the transformation of Prague from a city behind the Iron Curtain to a modern, upbeat, western city that has retained cool elements of its communist past.
To me, no neighbourhood displays this better than Žižkov — a grittier, historically working-class quarter infused with hipster cafés, craft brew pubs, and cool retro designers. With its awesome blend of old and new Prague, Žižkov is not to be missed.
FRIDAY4PM Shake off the jet lag with a nice walk in Park Rajská Zahrada and stop by the beer garden for a quick refreshment before heading out to dinner.
6PM Nothing beats jet lag better than Czech comfort food and a well poured beer. Head to Hostinec U Vodoucha, a classic hospoda packed with locals, for an authentic experience. I suggest the Pork Knuckle (189 koruna) and a pint of Mordýř 12° (45 koruna). The richness of the pork combined with the pickled veggies and a good lager to wash it down can’t be beat.
9 PM After dinner walk back to Namesti Jiří z Podebrad to take in nighttime views of the church, Kostel Nejsvětějšího Srdce Páně, and then head underground to BeerGeek. A craft brew house that’s constantly rotating its great selection of draft beers, they also offer small bites including a HUGE selection of chicken wings (monkey wings) that pair perfectly with what’s on tap. The bar’s warm, fun atmosphere draws people in and it can get pretty crowded on a Friday night so if you’d rather climb back into bed, check out their selection of to-go beers.
SATURDAY9AM Rise and shine! Žižkov is home to Vitkov Hill, a national monument to Jan Žižka’s victory over the Crusaders in 1420. It’s also a great place to take a quick run or hike to wake up. If you climb to the top you’ll be rewarded with spectacular views of Prague from the base of the massive equestrian statue of Jan Žižka.
11 AM Refreshed, and having taken in the stunning views of Prague head back down to My Coffee Story. A modern, neighbourhood coffee shop that serves great espresso and a nice selection of breakfast foods. Try the soft boiled eggs, Tri vejce ve skle, (135 koruna) or the homemade waffle with fresh fruit and mascarpone (110 koruna) to get your morning started off right.
1PM Žižkov is home to some great up-and-coming local designers. A few of my favorite shops include the über hip, cult, Czech bag brand, Playbag on Borivojova and Botas 66 on Krizkovskeho, which carries a wide range of runners, designed after Communist era Czech sport shoes, Botas or botasky. With new designs ranging from whimsical rainbow to classic brown leather this stop is sure to be a hit no matter what your style.
Let the Communist exploration continue with a visit to Bohemian Retro, a vintage shop specializing in items from pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. Despite the selection being a little more tired than I remember, it is still worth a quick stop. A more modern assortment of women’s wear can be found at SugarBat, which carries a wide variety of retro clothing that they describe as “pin-up, rockabilly and goth styles.” Nearby, on Mánesova, lingerie designer Zuzana Kubickova’s showroom and studio has a stunning selection of women’s intimates along some beautiful outerwear collections.
3PM Czechs love to grab coffee and a sweet afternoon snack. Stop by the newly opened Donut Shop and grab a coffee and brown-butter (56 koruna), or maple-bacon (54 koruna) doughnut to-go. Do as the locals do, and head back to the many benches at the square to enjoy your snack while you take in the sites and do a little people watching.
4PM Freshly refueled, or perhaps in need of another cup of coffee, saunter on over to Jirak Farmer’s Market. Described by Taste of Prague as “one of the best things to do in Prague,” this quaint market has the rare distinction of being on Wednesday to Saturday. The food and decorations change with the season, and the selection of fresh fruits, meats, coffee, wine and hot food items in fabulous. People rave about the crepes from Galetka, and the coffee from Kavovy Klub.
5PM End your shopping experience with a visit to NeverEnough. The local design shop sports an in-house bar, great music and friendly staff. Grab a cocktail or beer while perusing NeverEnough brandwear (my favourite) in addition to a more limited selection of shirts from several European designers.
8PM For upscale food in a relaxed environment, head to Riccardo Lucque’s La Bottega Gastronomica. The airy bistro has perfect window seats overlooking Mahlerovy Sady Park which makes for great people watching while enjoying the fine selection of delicious daily dishes, homemade pasta and divine wines.
SUNDAY10AM A visit to Prague wouldn’t be complete without a classic Czech breakfast of koláč from Antoninovo Pekarstvi. Be sure to try the makovy (poppy seed), and tvaroh (similar to cottage cheese), as well as the seasonal fruit selection. Apricot is always a favourite.
Noon The strange, somewhat ugly TV tower, with freaky climbing babies, built on an old Jewish cemetery defines Žižkov’s (and Prague’s) landscape. To catch a wonderful last bird’s eye view, take the elevator to the observatory (230 koruna) where you can watch films about Prague.
WHERE TO STAYAirBnB has a great selection of apartments for rent that are perfectly located to enjoy the most of Žižkov. Use this link to get a $40 credit!

It’s kind of ridiculous that I’m writing about Prague, my first destination after my month long program on my last leg of the trip in Croatia. But Prague represents a special place for me as it was a place to drown my depressed state with cheap delicious beer after studying the Holocaust intensively for a month.
Prague is a popular destination for not only Europeans but also the floods of Asian tourists who come in huge groups on massive coaches. Why do they all come halfway around the world?
Could it be the Charles Bridge where brilliant performers and caricature artists invade the sides of the bridge? Or is it the famously disappointing Old Astronomical Clock that leaves eager crowds to the tip of their toes every hour only to realize its short act?
The infamous tourist attractions of Prague are deserving of their title as some sights really reward your hard earned tourist dollars. For example, the nightscape of Prague Castle and Charles Bridge is ridiculously beautiful and one to be remembered.
But if you have at least more than a day in Prague, the rest of the city is worth exploring and may even outweigh the attractions listed in your Lonely Plant or Rick Steve’s guide. Even 5 nights here wasn’t enough to get a full taste of Prague, but if you need some ideas, take a look at my suggestions below!
Nábřeží Edvarda Beneše, 118 00 Praha 7, Czechia
I hate to see this place getting busier than it already is with the locals enjoying their beer (32 crowns for half a litre if I’m not mistaken) over sweeping Panorama views. Forget Petrin Park, you want to check out Letna Park for its many beer gardens, musicians/DJs and also friendly vibes.
Head to the red Metronome statue in the centre of the park and on top of the stairs (above the beer gardens) which was built to symbolize the long struggle against communism. Here you will see a familiar skate park for those 90’s kids that remember Tony Hawk’s skateboarding games. On the other side you will see a magnificent panorama of Old and New Prague.
V Pevnosti 159/5b, 128 00 Praha 2, Czechia
This one is a little more well-known with tourists, but it still deserves a spot on my list because it is expansive enough to make you feel like you’re the only one in the park. Relatively close to the Old Town, when the city starts getting hot and bustling with the package tours, escape to Vyšehrad for some peace and beautiful views.
Some of Prague’s oldest buildings are housed here, so for history geeks like myself, it’s such a treat.
Kostelní 1320/42, 170 78 Praha 7, Czechia
If you’re looking for some unconventional but well done museums, avoid the Communism museum — made up of cheap write ups and replicas of everything, and come to the National Technical Museum! Being an Arts student, I try to stay away from anything technical. But the inner boy in me came out when I saw the museums impressive fleet of cars, motorcycles, and planes. The museum itself is quite large and also has some historical context of the importance of these products so to add the technological aspect of experiencing Prague, the technical museum is an awesome alternative to the traditional museums.
Also students get a discount so make sure you bring your ISIC card or school ID with the years on it.
1, 120 00 Praha 2-Vinohrady, Czechia
This one was a bit of a lucky find along the way to Vyšehrad. It’s a quiet park that’s tucked in a nicer neighbourhood of Prague and I highly recommend grabbing some groceries and setting up picnic. If you’re lazier like me and enjoy beer more than bread, bring a bottle(s) and head out to the terrace in front of the classy restaurant in the middle. Here you will see another magnificent panorama of the newer areas of the city.
This one is a bit of a cheat because it’s not really in Prague, but it’s close proximity to the city with loads of sights make it an awesome way to escape the swarm of tourists. While Kutna Hora can be done within half a day, for those that take longer or would appreciate having quaint peace, a night or two wouldn’t hurt either!
Some sights in Kutna Hora include the infamous Sedlec Ossuary or AKA the Bone church (which is extremely short and close to being a tourist trap if it wasn’t for the freaky nature of having so many bones displayed openly), St. Barbara’s Church, and the Jesuit College — which generally opens exhibitions and other galleries.
A quick tip for travellers by train, make sure you purchase the ticket that goes to Kutna Hora Město. The main railway station for Kutna Hora is actually quite a bit ways from the actual town so make sure you remember to transfer into a smaller local train to take you to the Město.
The fact that I am able to remember these places at the top of my head must mean something. I hope you will also enjoy some of the places shared to me by locals, fellow backpackers, and Google. If you enjoyed these travel ideas for Prague and would like to see them for the other cities, let me know with a comment or a like!

I always thought eastern Europe would be cold and grey and Prague is no exception. But, as I walk past grungy stone walls under a slate sky, I notice the city’s canvas begin to fill with color. Each loud scarf or alleyway stencil builds anticipation toward my colorful destination, The Lennon Wall. However, as I weave through the side streets of this quiet, cobblestoned neighborhood in search of this mural homage to the late Beatle’s front-man, the wall is nowhere to be found! Just before I turn to my map for guidance, I spot a huddle of travelers staring at a simple message written across whitewashed facade in the distance. “Wall Is Over.”
All that remains from this crowdsourced feat of artistic expression were these big block letters. What a buzz kill! But then, as I look closer, I see a streak of fresh paint coloring the outline of an umbrella in the bottom right corner. Maybe this is a more apt portrait of Prague’s beauty. A place with a medieval core spared from world-war destruction, a towering castle beyond the reach of any mere mortal, and a body of citizens freed from communism just 15 years prior still teems with the rumblings of creative individuality. Just hours after the wall was painted over, as is customary practice every four years, the people have already begun to fill the space with life.
Prague is alive. The buildings’ imposing exteriors contain the thumping passion of proud Czechs. I could hear the city’s collective effervescence in the the fraternal “Čau!” as anyone enters or leaves a room or through the cracked window of an underground pub. The beer is cheap, tasty, and omnipresent. More signs for Pilsner Urquell (the local water) fill the streets than stoplights. With early sunsets, bars that never close, and pints that range from $1–1.50 USD, it is no wonder Prague’s happening nightlife is no secret to the world. One simply needs to step outside to hear packs of fashionable young people that make the streets feel like the hallways of the United Nations. To walk the streets is to share a drink with both the buildings and their inhabitants — each additional round bringing you closer to the city’s pulsing soul.
It is hard to decide whether the streets are more beautiful by day or by night. By day, the signature burnt orange roofs that top the baroque buildings give the old town a sense of cohesion, as if to cross the Charles Bridge is to step into a 14th century universe. By night, streaks of light shoot up Gothic facades like shooting stars, creating long shadows that imbue even the most ordinary storefront with a sense of magic. The Vlatava River snakes through the city like a moat for the Castle, while trams carry the lifeblood that courses through the city’s veins. Prague’s hip energy remains inclusive and accessible. Like leaving a dinner party at the house of an incredibly welcoming host, I felt a sense of home that demands a speedy return.

Ages ago I promised my wife Anne a trip to Prague, one of the European capitals she had never visited. I finally got round to organising it this year.
This piece is not about our destination, but about our journey. We try to avoid unnecessary flights and last year we bought a Tesla Model 3, so why not make it a road trip? We wanted to document what it is like to travel by Tesla. Other electric vehicles are available but I cannot speak with any authority about what the experience of driving them on a similar trip might be. Moreover, if you are looking for tips about Prague, or other cities, look elsewhere.
Prague is about 1100 km from where we live west of Paris. After consulting the road atlas, the Tesla website and various guides to the Czech Republic we decided on a six-day trip. Two days driving, with a stopover in Heidelberg, two nights in Prague, two in Karlovy Vary, and one in Luxembourg on the way back, (thereby knocking a second unvisited European capital off the list).
Having chosen where we wanted to go, and when, we let Tesla make most of the remaining choices. We picked hotels which had Tesla destination chargers, and where there was a choice went as close to the city centre as possible1. We weren’t trying to do this on a budget (it was a birthday present after all), and once in the hotels we wanted to be able to visit our destinations without getting into the car again.
No visas were required for us, but we did have to get two for the car: the German emissions sticker that allowed us in to Heidelberg city centre, and the Czech motorway vignette.
I usually charge my Model 3 to around 90 per cent, which gives around 430 km of range. The car warns against frequent charging above 90% and the last 10% is slow, but for long trips I push it up to 95 per cent (around 470 km) which I did on this occasion.
As we packed we kept a watchful eye on the developing coronavirus situation. By 29 February France had identified 73 cases of Covid-19. Germany 79. The situation in Northern Italy was causing serious concern, but travel to and from Germany, the Czech Republic and Luxembourg was not subject to controls2.
Sunday 1 March Home to Heidelberg (659 km)
The plan was that this would involve about six hours driving and one hour charging. The on-board route planner suggested charging at the Reims-Champagne services on the A4 for 15 minutes and then again near Metz for 25. But I managed to drive past the chargers in the service area and couldn’t legally turn back so we had to go on to the next exit, turn round, charge on the Paris-bound side, and then complete the circuit by continuing to the next exit towards Paris and turning round again. Wasted time about 40 minutes; wasted distance about 60 kilometres.
Our second charging stop was in Hauconcourt near Metz, and by the time we had had a quick lunch we were charged up and in danger of incurring idle charges3.
Tesla superchargers in France are frequently located in hotel car parks (often Accor brands) near to but not on the autoroute. This means that you don’t have to be on the motorway to have access to them. However some, such as Reims-Champagne are in the motorway service areas, and others — such as Metz are in commercial centres.
We reached Heidelberg in time to have a walk around the Altstadt and up to the castle before it got dark. We put the car on charge in the hotel car park overnight.
Monday 2 March Heidelberg to Prague (513 km)
Wanting to maximize our time in Prague we drove straight there, stopping only to buy our Czech motorway vignette and to recharge at the last supercharger in Germany (Wernberg-Kôblitz). Most of the route was on the A6 through southern Germany, which was consistently busy with trucks, but no serious congestion. Many junctions and bridges had roadworks so speed limits kept oscillating between 80, 100, 120 and 130 kph, and for some stretches, no limit at all. Prudence (the name I have given the car in recognition of her cautious approach to overtaking and driving in general) effortlessly accelerated to 180 kph, but I didn’t test her beyond that, and didn’t keep that up for long.
We crossed the border into the Czech republic without really noticing it, and certainly without having to stop which, for someone who grew up and lived for almost 40 years with an Iron Curtain across Europe, still came as a surprise. The car took us by what seemed a circuitous route round the back of the castle to our hotel, but when we saw the streets that a more direct approach would have involved we understood why.
Tuesday 3 March Prague (0 km)
Our hotel was ideally situated between the Old Town and the Castle. Trams and buses abound, but we were close enough to walk everywhere.
Wednesday 4 March Prague to Karlovy Vary (129 km)
After 48 hours in Prague we made the short journey to Karlovy Vary. The road was busy with trucks, and being upgraded in various stretches, but we had no hold-ups and no hiccups.
This once-grand spa town has an abundance of C19 and early C20 hotels crowded round the river and thermal springs. After checking in to an elegant and imposing hotel — again chosen because of its Tesla destination charger — we had plenty of time to walk around, get our bearings, and find some dinner.
Thursday 5 March: Karlovy Vary (O km)
A beautiful sunny day ideal for a good long walk in the woods and some time in the pool.
Friday 6 March: Karlovy Vary to Luxembourg (783 km)
A 9 o’clock start for a full day of driving, under grey skies and with a lot of rain, sleet and drizzle. As before we followed Tesla’s suggested route, driving through the Fichtel Mountains and the forests of Franconia before stopping three hours out from Karlovy Vary in the small town of Motten. Here, in what seemed like the middle of nowhere, we found a brand-new 16-stall Supercharger at which we were the only customer. We also found the wonderful Gasthof zum Biber where we had an early, and copious, lunch.
Motten was right for our East-West journey, but I suspect most of its users will be from the nearby A7 motorway which takes traffic from Northern Germany to Italy.
We saw at first hand quite how many trees there are this part of Germany, and were encouraged to see how many fields have been covered in part with solar panels.
From Motten we were able to get to Luxembourg, albeit with only about 30 kilometres left in the ‘tank’. The most difficult part of the journey was the last 500 metres to the hotel because of extensive road works around the station. I have to confess to a certain amount of ‘range concern’ if not full-blown ‘range anxiety’ but took comfort in Elon Musk’s assurance that there are 10–20 km of reserve capacity even after the screen reads empty. And if the worst came to the worst I could pull in to any service station/hotel/business with a standard electric plug and hook up to that for a while.
Once again, we had chosen the hotel not only because of its convenient location, but also because it has a destination charger. And for the first time the network let us down, because it is an older charger which does not recognise the Model 3 (at least, it wouldn’t connect with ours). Fortunately there was an adjacent Mennekes charger, which the hotel staff advised us to use.
Day 7: Luxembourg to home (418 km)
The car was fully-charged by the morning, and after a couple of hours walking around the historic centre of Luxembourg, and a detour to leave Luxembourg because of the same road works we had encountered on the way in, we headed straight home. Again one brief charging stop, at the same Reims-Champagne services we used on the way out. We could have made it without charging but we would not have been able to drive at 130 kph.
Afterword
I had considered before setting out whether to subscribe to the Chargemap Pass4, or one of the alternative networks of chargers5, for added peace of mind, but decided against, wanting to test the Tesla network.
The test was passed. During the six days we drove a total of 2373 km consuming 426 KwH of electricity at an average consumption of 180 Wh per kilometer. Much of the trip was on motorways where we maintained a cruising speed of 130 kph, sometimes more. We had lights on for the great majority of the trip, and wipers for much of it too.
We missed one Supercharger because we didn’t follow the instructions closely enough; and one exit because we weren’t paying attention to the navigation system. The busiest supercharger we came across (Metz) had five stands occupied out of eight, at the others there were only one or two other cars, and none at all in Motten. The destination chargers all worked well except the last.
We had one screen restart while driving, which was disconcerting, but lasted only 40 seconds or so.
I make a lot of use of the basic level of Autopilot (Traffic-aware cruise control), primarily so I don’t have to maintain pressure with my right leg. It is particularly useful in dense traffic which is running at low speeds or stopping and starting. I use Autosteer and Navigate on Autopilot more sparingly, and find that they work best in relatively empty roads. The driving habits of other drivers are sometimes more aggressive than Autosteer is comfortable with: for example if I pull out to overtake, and then — as often happens — the car behind me pulls out at more or less the same time, and close behind — the Tesla will abort the manoeuvre, sensing danger. That is safe, but unnecessarily prudent — hence my pet name for the car.
Our Supercharger stops cost about €80 in all for a total of 270 KwH; recharging the battery at home to the level at which we started will have cost about €10. Had we taken our old (diesel) car we would have used about 150 litres, at least €200 worth of fuel.
The remaining electricity was included in our overnight parking. The autoroutes in France cost about €60 in total, and we spent €25 on vignettes. That gives a total non-accommodation cost about €175, although that takes no account of depreciation on the car.
We could have flown to Prague for about the same basic price, but to that we would have had to add airport transfers, and if we wanted to see Karlovy Vary as well, taxi or bus fares.
We drove through four countries, visited two capital cities, two historic towns and a couple of places we’d never heard of before.
As of Friday 13 March the Czech Republic has closed its borders. When the world calms down, we’d consider similar trips to other European cities.

2. Anne guessed that by the time we returned there would be 300 cases of Covid-19 in France, I guessed 500. In fact there were 700, and it was becoming clear that that was almost certainly an underestimate. We tried to avoid crowds and — at the time of writing — have experienced no unusual symptoms. Whether we were increasing or reducing our risk, or the risk to others, by travelling we have no idea.

Last weekend I had the pleasure to spend two wonderful days in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. It was my second time there but I was shocked because of the beauty of the city. My first time there has been in winter, therefore it was a completely different atmosphere now with sunshine in the middle of the summer.
I visited Prague with my boyfriend and despite hours of sightseeing and enjoying summer vibes there was one thing that we both realized quite soon when we arrived.
Most of the people seemed completely unhappy and were extremely unfriendly.
As we are both entrepreneurs by heart we are always curious and constantly looking around for new learnings, even during our travels. Also when sitting on the train to Prague we were talking about what exciting things we were probably going to discover and how we could make a business out of those things but what we actually found out was quite different.
I did not do any research on this and probably we, by coincidence, met a couple of the few unfriendly people in Prague but it was significantly obvious, thus I want to share our experiences.
In fact, Viennese people are told to be extremely impolite people. Viennese cafès even have the most impolite waitresses, that’s something…

A personal tour guide of Prague and Czech Republic

Many tourists wonder how Prague could survive the war without any significant damage. Not that much true though, but comparing to other cities in Europe, Prague was one of the lucky ones. In this post I would like to take you for a virtual tour to tell you more about what you can experience on my Memorial Tour. Just in case you are still note decided to book.
Memorial Tour usually starts next to the Municipal House. This is the best place to talk about changes in our history, how we transformed from thousand years old Czech Kingdom to Czechoslovakian Republic and how Nazis took control over the country. The Municipal House was the location of the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence in 1918. It is here, where literally, the freedom was born.
Let’s immerse to the streets of Old Town and talk about how life changed under Nazi rule. Did you know, that in the first days of occupation, Nazis ordered a change-over to a right-hand traffic system, and we had only 9 hours to prepare for it? Many brave people joined protests that culminated in November 1939 when all Czech universities were closed and over 1200 students were sent to Nazi concentration camps. We will see the Charles University, the symbol of democracy and fight for the freedom.
There are so many brave people that put their lives for our country. Many of them were members of the resistance, many others died in the last days of the war when they stood against Nazi occupiers. Streets of Prague were full of barricades from any material they could find — cobblestones, furniture, cars… We will see the traces of this fights, that are still visible — you just have to know where to look. And of course, we will also talk about the Jewish community and their members, who were send to various concentration camps all over Europe. Did you know, that Nazis made a decision to protect all synagogues, just to use them as their museums?
The major part of our Memorial Tour will be about one of the bravest actions that was ever done — Operation Anthropoid. The Butcher of Prague or The Blond Beast are two (of many more) nicknames of Reinhard Heydrich, the new governor of Czech lands. He arrived to Prague in 1941 and immediately started persecutions of Czech political and intellectual personalities. He also gave orders to establish a ghetto and to start with the Jewish transports. He eventually paid for all what he did to Czechs in 1942 when two Czechoslovakian paratroopers from the resistance tried assassinate him. To know how it all happened we will visit the church of St. Cyril and St. Methodius in New Town district.
Are you interested to know more, to see it all? Just join me for Memorial Tour.
P.S. I will try to show you also the Petschek Palace. This building was build shortly before the WW2 for the merchant banker Julius Petschek, with all the modern gadgets such as tube post or paternoster lift. During the Nazi occupation the Palace became the Gestapo headquarters. The horrific tortures and interrogations took place in its basement, and there is a small exhibition about what happened in the rooms nowadays. Petschek Palace is used by the Ministry of Trade and Industry today, therefore the visit is only on request.

Travelling through Europe had always been a dream for me — not as part of a typical group tour with strict itineraries, but as a slow, meandering journey where I experience different countries getting a feel for the life in this continent.
This was my third trip… and towards the end of the trip I felt something very unexpected.
It was something that I’d never seen in travel vlogs or read in blogs that walk you through the adventures and experiences of Europe.
I was in Prague — it was my last day of the trip. I was walking over the beautiful bridge that connected old town with the extravagant Prague castle. The atmosphere was very lively, people walking around joyfully with live music being played at every corner. The weather was pleasant too and I was surrounded by the best landscape of river, mountain, and the beautiful Prague castle.
And yet — I wasn’t mind-blown.
I hate to admit it — but it all felt… normal. Not because the city was dull or unimpressive. On the contrary, Prague is one of the most beautiful places I have seen.
It was an amazing vibe, so much so that it made me feel guilty for not being surprised or mind blown by the ambience. An ambience that anyone would die to experience.
I realized this was happening to me because I had seen so many beautiful cities, wonderful architecture, and gorgeous landscapes that my brain had subconsciously normalized it.
My brain had adjusted itself to this new reality, and all the beautiful places had unknowingly become my new normal.
It was like eating your favorite ice cream every day only to find out that it doesn’t excite you anymore.
I learned something new that evening in Prague — even the best things or the best places we see or experience in life cease to excite you or offer surprise spark after a point.
It stops being special.
I had always dreamed of seeing the Swiss Alps, climbing the Florence cathedral dome, watching the sunset from the Prague castle — and all those things were truly amazing — but now that I was on the right side of all those experiences — everything else felt just normal.
In fact, when I look back at all achievements or special moments of my life — they all had eventually subsided and became mundane. When I got my first job, or started living in my dream city, or when I first started dating — all the feelings that excited me beyond imagination at first started to feel ordinary when they became reality.
Perhaps, the moment you accomplish your goals — your brain normalizes it. Sparks begin to fade; you aren’t surprised or mind blown anymore and it feels just routine.
Think for yourself, the life that you are living now, in this exact moment, was a life that your younger self would’ve dreamt of… and yet it feels just another day today.
Having said that — know that just because your brain normalizes something doesn’t mean it isn’t an achievement that you should stop being proud of. It simply means life has used that achievement as a conduit to move upward and you have outgrown yourself.
You now have bigger ambitions and bigger desires that excite you.
So — don’t dismiss your efforts or take your achievements for granted just because it feels normal now.
The younger version of me — the one who dreamt of travelling, doing everything from solo adventures to group outings — would be in awe of everything I’ve experienced today.

Žižkov, Anděl, Budějovická, Hradčanská, Staroměstská, Náměstí Míru, Háje…?
What do these weird Czech names mean and how does the area look like?
Prague is divided into districts, as you may already found out, those districts are divided into smaller parts with a specific name and also specific lifestyle you can experience.
During my Prague´s life I have lived in many various parts of the Prague city. I was also lucky enough to meet with wide range of experiences Prague can offer. After all I have decided to share my point of view and try to do a short, but hopefully an accurate review about those different districts.
Now, let´s come back to our — still for now — unknown Prague´s district called Prague 3 or in Czech Praha 3: if you are already in crazy mood of your Erasmus and want to practice Czech language, you nerd!
The district includes officially most of the cadastral area of Žižkov and parts of Vinohrady, Vysočany and Strašnice.
This district varies a lot as you move from one site to the oppossite one. Around “borders” with other districts, like Prague 2 (Vinohrady), Prague 10 (Strašnice) and Prague 9 (Vysočany) it lives their own life. Žižkov, the main part of P3, is less international than P2 or P1. You will also come across some really old and damaged buildings or even abandoned, but that´s what makes its spirit.
When I was going through this area I felt like in 80´s in Czech republic, life after the revolution.
It´s a calmer area, older Czech people are living here, but don´t worry, you won´t feel like in a retirement home. There are many cafes around and pubs as well. You should check out Café Pavlač, for instance!
Žižkov and P3, in general, offers a wide range of flats for rent. Flats are mainly less expensive, situated in older tall buildings — typicall for Czech republic. As I am mentioning in a Lifestyle paragraph, you will meet older people with their dogs, also some Gypsies, however you can still live in a luxurious flat and rock a world from Vítkov hill or Žižkov´s tower (highest peek in Prague by the way).
Itself is a bit different. I would express it as more Czech not so international part, a bit older, not playing a theatre for tourists. It is also more industrial with older buildings. Its highlight is certainly Vítkov park — if you want to feel a true history as a though guy, go there! At the hill took a place one of the main battles of Hussite wars. If you are still being nerdy, calm down, I have not forgotten, Žižkov is also an area of Franz Kafka — a famous Czech writer! By the way the name Žižkov comes from a name Jan Žižka, who was Czech general and Hussite leader, follower of Jan Hus — simply a though guy with one eye.
As you see above, Žižkov area also offers some architecture craziness as climbing babies at a tower, but also many interesting corners for you to observe in old Prague.

By Jacques Poitras
MATT WELCH WAS back in Prague for the Party at the End of the World. It was March 1, 1995, and the newspaper and the life he had created for himself were crumbling in the old cobblestone streets of the Czech capital. Prognosis, the English-language rag he had launched five years earlier with a few friends, had ceased publishing; tonight, a final, drunken bash would send it off into history.
Before heading to the party at Rock Club Bunkr, a bar housed in a former Communist nuclear bomb shelter, Welch, some of the other founders, and a few friends ducked into U Vejvodů, a traditional Czech pub. They reminisced about all the struggles going back to the beginning. Charlie Hornberger, the paper’s last editor-in-chief, described closing down the office. Welch shared anecdotes from the Budapest Business Journal, where he’d taken a job two months earlier. At their feet sat bundles of newspapers: the cover of the final issue of Prognosis showed a Communist-built apartment complex crumbling under the headline “The End.”
That possibility had been looming for months, even years. Prognosis had never made a single koruna in profit. Then again, that had never been the point. “Though it misfired and miscued on more than one occasion,” Welch wrote in a goodbye essay, “Prognosis at its full bloom was one of the most ferociously good newspapers any part of the world has ever seen. There is no satisfaction that can compare to this essential fact, nor any disappointment that can diminish its luster. Prognosis was, for nearly four full years, the exact sum of what the editorial staff imagined a great newspaper should be.”
And now it was over. Along with those defiant superlatives, Welch’s essay dished out an equal helping of self-pity. The other founders of the paper had postponed promising careers to embark on this adventure with him; “I, as a college dropout with little experience at anything, had nothing except an exaggerated sense of self-worth,” he wrote. “I am acutely aware that my life, such as it is right now, exists because of this newspaper and this experience called Prognosis. … Fact is, I now have something akin to a viable life, and the tangible source of that life is now dead.”
Prague was no longer the dreamy, mystical city Welch and his friends had discovered in 1990 as it emerged from the Cold War. The looseness of those post-Velvet Revolution days was fading, and the city was completing its transition from Soviet bloc outpost to Western destination. The Czechs were cashing in, hustlers now outnumbered hipsters, and the market was swallowing those, like Prognosis, who didn’t cut it.
Back home in the United States, Ken Layne, a former Prognosis writer, read Welch’s farewell column. The piece, he told me in 1995, “just shows Welch playing his favourite role: the bumbling can’t-get-my-shit-together-but-I-mean-well loser. … He refuses to take real responsibility for stuff falling apart. Prognosis failed because the founders had no interest or experience in running a successful business—and that’s what a newspaper is: a business. They thought business was bad and success was evil.”
ACROSS THE TABLE at U Vejvodů, Doug Arellanes, a former art director at the paper, pulled out an old letter. In 1990 Welch and two other founders — campus paper colleagues from the University of California at Santa Barbara — wrote to Arellanes from Prague. They shared the excitement of an idea: to launch an English-language newspaper in the Czech capital. “The key to all this I think is tapping as many good people as we can,” Christopher Scheer wrote in that letter, “not running this like a business but like a movement.” He would later explain: “No one starts a business with basically no money. We did. Lacking money, we damn well better have some love and elbow grease to carry us through. We were somewhat fatalistic, also, realizing that any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success.”
Welch had arrived in Eastern Europe that August to write a novel. When the other Americans who made up the future core of Prognosis pulled into Prague at the end of disparate backpacking trips, he was away in pre-war Yugoslavia; his pals discovered he had already established a profile. “He made quite an impression on this town,” Scheer wrote to Arellanes. “Women strewn in his wake, fans rumour-mongering about his eternally imminent return … It’s like Jesus!”
Anyone who met Matt Welch understood why. His long, blond hair, piercing dark eyes and affable demeanour often made him the center of attention. In Prague, he took to playing guitar for passers-by and spare change on the city’s postcard-perfect 700-year-old Charles Bridge. Back home in California, he had worked alongside the other Prognosis founders at the Daily Nexus, the University of California at Santa Barbara student paper, composing its weather forecasts as beat poetry. “He drank enormously, liked to wear dresses to work once a week and otherwise tried to create a mythos about himself,” Scheer would remember.
There was no shortage of talent among the founders of Prognosis, but Welch seemed to be the catalyst. He was “incredibly skilled at assembling myriad people to make his daydreams come to life,” according to Ken Layne. “I once told Matt the reason he’d never finish [writing] a book of fiction is because he’s too goddamn busy living a book of fiction.” If his life was, as he told it, going nowhere until he reached Prague, then the city offered the ideal setting for his apotheosis.
BESIDES THE STUNNING architecture, a rich cultural tradition, and women with beautiful Slavic eyes, Prague had Václav Havel. Czechoslovakia’s president knew about rising from despair to an exalted position. Havel, a playwright, had been jailed as a dissident by the Communists before the Velvet Revolution of November 1989 transformed him into head of state. He remained an idealist who talked of “living in truth” and building a civic society; for young Americans disenchanted with the Republicanism of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Havel added to Prague’s appeal. “My God, this is what politics should be,” John Allison, an early expat arrival, would remember thinking after seeing Havel’s February 1990 speech to the U.S. Congress. “This is my calling.” By the end of the year, Allison found himself working as the “American advisor” to Prague’s mayor.
Havel “did sort of underline the uniqueness of the place and time,” Christopher Scheer remembered. “He sort of encapsulated it. But he wasn’t the whole story, just a symptom, because every Czech we met seemed to have a wild story, to be oddly humble and intellectual at the same time. That’s why Havel could be president—because he represented a powerful strain in Czech culture.”
Welch came to idolize this rumpled philosopher-king who, indirectly, had made Prognosis possible. In his cramped apartment in an industrial section of Prague, a large poster of Havel occupied a place of honour on one wall. Someone had used a cigarette to burn out the eyes on another poster, of Václav Klaus, Czechoslovakia’s Thatcherite finance minister. You can deface anything on the walls, Welch once told a group of guests, except the Havel poster.
Besides Welch and Scheer, the other Americans who gathered at a pub in Prague in November 1990 to hash out the newspaper idea were Ben Sullivan, Laura Pitter, Jenny Ogar, and Lisa Frankenberg. They were all staying with Czech students Welch had befriended. “The next morning, we woke up hungover and had to decide if it was all just a beery fantasy,” Scheer recalled. “We decided tentatively that it wasn’t.”
The next evening, sober, they sat down and figured out how much money they could pool for the launch. Travellers’ cheques, credit card advances and anything they could sell were all put on the table. Everyone anted up except Lisa Frankenberg.
IN WELCH’S PROGNOSIS narrative, Lisa Frankenberg became the villain. Even in those early days, Scheer and others had doubts about Frankenberg, who had worked at the Nexus before leaving to get involved in the UCSB student government. Her unwillingness to put up money made them question her commitment to their Prague newspaper, but Welch, a friend, defended her. “She was not at all like our vibe,” Welch says. “We were pretty hippie and idealistic and journalism-based and easy to get along with. She was considerably more abrasive.” But he argued that “we need different types of personalities here, particularly on the business side, and maybe we can convert those negative characteristics into something we need.”
Today, the first few issues of the monthly Prognosis look amateurish, with unattractive fonts, awkward layout, and collegiate earnestness. But they were fresh and lively, and in the spring of 1991, with Prague’s expatriate population swelling, and thousands of English-speaking tourists on the way, they represented a triumph. The founders, their meager start-up funds supplemented with money from “investors” — a few well-heeled family friends back home — had waded through layers of left-over Communist bureaucracy just to launch the paper. The first edition, “zero issue,” was snapped up by expats and backpackers starved for something to read in English. The paper would go on to chronicle everything from the sweeping privatization of state institutions, to the growth of the drug trade and prostitution, to the establishment of an Andy Warhol Museum in the Slovak village where the artist’s mother was born. “We wanted to create something that had never existed, in a place where it was impossible to imagine such a thing existing,” Welch says.
Frankenberg soon began to have doubts. In charge of distribution and advertising, she heard the same comments over and over when she tried to sell subscriptions and ad space to the growing foreign business community. Prognosis was fun, but her prospective clients wanted serious business news to help them understand this lucrative new market. They also wanted it fast: a monthly paper didn’t provide immediacy in a quickly changing economy. And the sometimes arch, collegiate tone of the paper turned them off.
In an interview in 1995, Frankenberg described how no one at Prognosis seemed concerned about what she was hearing. “The attitude was, ‘We’re having fun, we’re enjoying this, why should we change?’” she told me. There was no business plan for growth, and no budget forecasting revenues and expenses. “Very clearly, the response [from the others] was, ‘We’re not a business, we’re a newspaper.’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute, a newspaper is a business.’”
Frankenberg’s worries were compounded the day Alan Levy visited the Prognosis office to offer his services. Levy, a 59-year-old American journalist, had covered the Prague Spring, Alexander Dubček’s 1968 attempt to democratize Communism from within. When Soviet tanks arrived to crush Dubček’s experiment, Levy was expelled. He lived in Vienna for 21 years, moving back shortly after the Velvet Revolution, and his book about 1968, So Many Heroes, became a must-read for expats. He proposed writing a column for Prognosis, a series of profiles of interesting Czechs and expatriates.
The founders turned him down. “We didn’t want to publish an archetypal expat-freelancer just because he had ‘clips,’” Welch later wrote. “I wasn’t at that fateful meeting, but apparently he came on strong and condescending, and I’m sure we were more than just a little defensive about people questioning our credentials and telling us what we should cover. So with those prejudices, we read his stuff and thought it wouldn’t fit into our Mission-from-God approach.”
Welch came to see it as a defining moment for the young paper: “We finally had confidence enough in what we were to reject an over-qualified representative of what we didn’t want to be,” Welch said. Frankenberg would later call her Prognosis colleagues “callow” for not hiring Levy. “I was flabbergasted that anyone would turn away such a gifted writer and I expressed my apologies to Alan,” she wrote years later. Frankenberg was now so frustrated that she considered packing it in and resuming her studies back in the States in the fall.
But in July 1991, a newspaper distributor working for Frankenberg had a chance meeting with a Texas businessman, Monroe Luther, who was in Prague inking deals. Luther told Frankenberg he might invest in Prognosis, but he wanted his money put to good use: he wanted a more business-oriented weekly, and suggested she come back with him in two days with a proposal to transform the paper.
According to Matt Welch and Christopher Scheer, Frankenberg and her philosophical soulmate in the Prognosis business office, Kent Hawryluk, demanded a radical change of editorial direction—more serious and business-friendly—without mentioning Luther’s possible infusion of cash. (Frankenberg disputed this account when I interviewed her in 1995, saying she was upfront about Luther’s investment offer and that the desire for a revamp came from him.) Frankenberg and Hawryluk also wanted to be equal partners in the business, a status denied to them because they had invested no money. Otherwise, they said, they’d walk. “Man, were we agonized,” Welch says. “We definitely needed them, and they did stuff we couldn’t imagine doing ourselves, but there was something pretty gross and not trustworthy about playing ultimatum games with an idealistic venture started by people of good faith. So ultimately, we said no.”
A few days later, Frankenberg and Hawryluk resigned from Prognosis and persuaded Luther to use his money to help them launch a business-oriented weekly called The Prague Post. It hit the streets in October, 1991, its early issues were hopelessly dull in design, style and content. But the paper knew how to sell itself: the Post played to the business community with credulous coverage of finance and investment, and bought prime space on billboards, branding itself a serious player in the marketplace and selling a lot of advertising. “Their initial billboards cost more than we spent in the first nine months of our entire operation,” Scheer recalled.
Alan Levy was hired as titular editor-in-chief of The Prague Post. “We are living in the Left Bank of the ’90s,” he declared in a column in the inaugural issue, alluding to Hemingway’s Paris. “For some of us, Prague is Second Chance City; for others a new frontier where anything goes, everything goes, and, often enough, nothing works. Yesterday is long gone, today is nebulous, and who knows about tomorrow, but, somewhere within each of us, we all know that we are living in a historic place at a historic time.”
The Prognosis founders were hardly jealous of the Post’s content—they rolled their eyes at Levy’s prose, and they wouldn’t miss Frankenberg and Hawryluk—but the pair took their advertising and distribution contacts with them. Suddenly, Prognosis was without a business staff, and without the network the pair had assembled to sell the newspaper in an often-baffling post-Communist environment. “It was like a jackhammer in the nuts,” Welch says. “It totally drained the joy out of the situation.”
Welch, Scheer, and the others responded by taking Prognosis biweekly and working even harder. “We did not, however, try to beat the Post at their own game,” Scheer said. “Arrogant or not, we decided very consciously to keep trying to put out the newspaper that we wanted to put out and not just try to be a local version of The Wall Street Journal.”
THEY STILL HAD HYPE on their side. For foreign reporters dropping in on Prague to profile the growing expat community, the grimy, cluttered Prognosis office was an essential stop. The paper represented the kind of journalism they secretly wanted to practice: fun, smart, brashly principled. Any feature piece on the self-exiled, twentysomethings of Prague inevitably included the same tropes: the American-owned New York Pizza restaurant; the mayor’s “American advisor,” John Allison, who had moved onto a job in Havel’s office in the majestic Castle overlooking the city; Laundry Kings, the American-owned, first-ever self-serve laundromat in Prague—and Prognosis. “It’s practically impossible to live here for any length of time and not be interviewed by some major paper or broadcast network, adding another level of absurdity to what is already a pretty ridiculous existence,” Welch would write. “All this silliness has not exactly hurt our paper, my career or my swelling ego needs.”
In July 1992 Welch was the central character in a lengthy article in Details magazine that many expats credited with single-handedly spinning the Prague hype-meter into the stratosphere. Using Prognosis as a framing device, writer Henry Copeland portrayed Prague as a hedonistic haven for a new lost generation. Welch and others would mock the article, particularly a quotation uttered by one Prognosis writer: “In Prague, everything is so open that you can re-invent yourself every day.” Yet a copy of that issue, preserved like new, was tucked away in Welch’s flat, where I discovered it during the two months I spent subletting his place.
In retrospect, that Details piece represented the high-water mark for expatriate Prague. The same summer it was published, reality began to intrude on the fairy tale: Czechoslovakia’s first full-scale elections, in June 1992 produced a political schism in the federation. Václav Klaus, leader of the Civic Democratic Party, triumphed in the Czech parliament, while the victory of a pro-independence party in Slovakia threatened to split the country. Klaus, a bottom-line man in favour of rapid privatization and economic restructuring, had no qualms about saying goodbye to the Slovaks: the poorer, slower-to-modernize, more rural part of the federation was a drag on his ideological plans. As president, Václav Havel sought to preserve the federation because of the multi-ethnic ideal it represented, but even Havel’s moral authority could not contain the forces that had been unleashed. On New Year’s Day, 1993, Czechoslovakia, the country that had survived Nazism and Communism, the two great totalitarian plagues of the twentieth century, ceased to exist.
Havel was soon chosen as president of the new Czech Republic and Klaus became its prime minister. Prognosis would call them “those wild and warring poster boys of the modern Czech soul.” Klaus, the no-nonsense, get-things-done manager in a hurry to downsize the machinery of government, was the efficient administrator, while Havel, the philosopher and moralist, was perfect for the role of symbolic head of state. They would clash repeatedly: Havel felt Klaus forgot the human element in governing; Klaus found Havel’s dreamy idealism impractical. “The advocate of non-political politics met a consummate political animal,” Havel’s biographer later wrote.
The schism echoed Prague’s expat newspaper war: Prognosis, though struggling financially, continued to strive for a journalistic ideal akin to Havel’s “living in truth” as it chronicled the changes in Czech society. The Post, Klaus-like in its pragmatism, prospered by playing to the market, giving the big-spending expat business community what it wanted. Prognosis was still cooler, but like Havel, it was no longer invincible.
THE DETAILS STORY drew me to Prague as I fled a recession-wracked newspaper industry in Canada. But by the time I arrived in January 1993, the city was re-inventing itself so quickly that it was no longer the Capital of Dreams sketched by the magazine just six months earlier. The cost of two expat staples, beer and apartment rent, both ridiculously cheap by U.S. standards in early 1992, were creeping up as the market adjusted to the city’s destination status. The talk now was less about Havel, the playwright president, and more about Klaus, the economic guru whose reforms were seen as a textbook example of how to move from Communism to capitalism.
Visiting reporters had also discovered a new source of expat wisdom. They now often visited the offices of The Prague Post to interview Lisa Frankenberg. Across town at Prognosis, meanwhile, the founders, exhausted by the grind of publishing and the battle with the Post, turned over senior editorial positions to newcomers and moved into writing positions, or onto new adventures. Welch relocated to Bratislava, the capital of newly independent Slovakia, to run the paper’s bureau there, while the new managers grappled with how to give the operation some much-needed stability.
The new publisher, Erica Breth, discovered there was still no real budget, business plan, or bookkeeping. (Scheer, when I interviewed him in 1995, disputed the idea that the founders had ignored the business side; they “worried enormously” about it, he said, but “none of it made our business sense any more acute, none of it made us more organized, none of it brought us big investors.”) More money from “investors” back in the U.S., including wealthy liberal philanthropist Helen Bing, couldn’t erase the red ink. The journalism remained solid, and Breth and her fellow managers stayed one step ahead of invoices from printers, phone companies and other suppliers. But Prognosis was sputtering financially.
Several staff members left in the summer and fall of 1993. Some, like me, were lured by jobs back home; most feared the paper’s demise was a matter of time. On a fundraising trip to the United States, Breth made the rounds of foundations and other do-gooders who had endowed the paper in the early days. But the Czech Republic’s much-publicized economic success meant, perversely, that the novelty of a scrappy little paper in Prague was wearing off. The money Breth gathered in early 1994 was quickly used, all at once, to pay off the paper’s printers, who hadn’t collected for months and were refusing to roll the presses.
Matt Welch wouldn’t give in. He left the bureau in Bratislava and returned to Prague, where he and Ben Sullivan, another founder, stepped back into senior editorial jobs under John Allison, who became editor-in-chief. “I still recall that the engine that was the news desk was being fueled almost single-handedly by Matt and John Allison, who both toiled mightily to put out a newspaper,” reporter Logan Mabe would say.
Welch was still making myths: Prognosis could rise again. In May, 1994, a Dutch businessman, Harmen Smink, injected cash by buying 51 per cent of the paper. Welch contacted a handful of Prognosis alumni in California, among them Ken Layne, and appealed to them to return to Prague. “He had these various godlike attributes attached to each of us,” Layne told me in 1995, “and he figured he could just play God and assemble a new group of ‘founders’ that would continue the legacy, as it were, and maybe put some fire and guts back into it.” Others were wary, but Layne accepted an offer to become editor-in-chief—until he learned at the last minute that he would not have the authority Welch had promised him. He was tempted, he said, to fly to Prague “just to beat the shit out of Matt and leave him for dead with his fucking guitar rammed up his hippy ass.” In Layne’s place, Charlie Hornberger, a Nexus pal of Welch, took over.
Smink’s money allowed Prognosis to move into better offices and go weekly with full-colour covers. Newsstand sales jumped, but advertising did not. Within a few weeks the problems began anew: Smink’s hard currency seemed to be evaporating. It would later emerge that the paper’s business manager was defrauding the paper, funneling money into her own private ventures. By the time anyone noticed, it was too late.
The newspaper’s philosophical guru up in Prague Castle was in no better state. As his popularity plummeted, Václav Havel mused to one interviewer about how he looked forward to leaving the presidency and becoming a simple pensioner. The economy, not ethics and morals, drove the agenda in Prague, and Prime Minister Václav Klaus was the man of the moment. He had a budget surplus forecast for 1995, the lowest inflation rate in the former Soviet bloc, and a jobless rate below four per cent. At the end of 1994, Klaus mocked Havel’s idea of the president delivering a “State of the Nation” address to Parliament — then delivered one himself. Poll after poll showed Czechs considered Havel the more principled of the two men, but they trusted Klaus to run the country.
On New Years’ Day, 1995, Klaus gave a look-ahead interview to the country’s first private TV station, Nova. In a clear attempt to eclipse the president, it was broadcast at the same time as Havel’s New Year’s address on state television. Of Havel’s remarks, Prognosis reported: “Far from an optimist in his days of waning popularity and influence, Havel could apparently muster only the dark conclusion that ‘Not everything is lost yet.’”
The president might as well have been talking about the expat newspaper inspired by his idealism. As the financial situation worsened, Welch accepted a job at the Budapest Business Journal. Smink tried to buy out the remaining 49 per cent of the paper still owned by Welch and the founders; when they balked, he cut off salaries and shopped his controlling shares to potential buyers, including The Prague Post. A gossip column in the February 21 issue of Prognosis ended prophetically with a comment that “all things come to an end sometime.” The following week, the founders decided to maintain their paper’s dignity. They closed it down.
MATT WELCH SAT down with a bottle of wine at his desk in Budapest at the end of February 1995 and wrote a piece for the final issue of Prognosis that would be headlined “A Long Goodbye to the Paper I Loved Best.”
“We were right all along,” Welch wrote, “if excessively stupid and self-indulgent in the deployment.” He expressed pride in the legacy Prognosis would leave—in particular the journalism education it gave to many young Czechs and Slovak interpreters and translators who became talented reporters for local media organizations—but he also mourned: this was the piece in which he declared that “the tangible source of [his] life is now dead,” tying his own fate to that of the daydream he would soon bury. “What I was expressing there,” he says now, “was a kind of gratitude for having been able to experience something that made me at least quasi-presentable to the world of journalism, and a melancholy for that beautiful and helpful thing being dead.”
Lisa Frankenberg told me she felt no sense of triumph at the demise of Prognosis, even though it gave her Prague Post a freer hand in Prague’s English-language media market. She claimed to be moved by Welch’s coda. “There were probably only a handful of people who read that through to the end. I read it. I read it to the very end,” she said. Winning the expat newspaper war was “very weird and sad. It was a very weird day. We knew it was coming for a long time.”
One night in May 1995, as the spring air brought with it the promise of another beautiful summer in Prague, Frankenberg took a stroll on the Charles Bridge with Monroe Luther, the owner of the Post. They talked about the paper’s prospects: its circulation was rising, and a growing number of English-speaking Czechs read it. “It’s a successful business,” Frankenberg told me at the time, though she refused to reveal if it was profitable.
Suddenly Frankenberg saw a familiar figure with a guitar, blond hair waving in the breeze as he strummed on the bridge. “Hey, Matt!” she yelled. He smiled, answered, “Hey, Frankenberg.” Matt Welch was back in town, and could still muster a smile for his former rival.
Frankenberg and Luther kept walking. “Someday in the future, I’d like to sit down with him and have a coffee or a beer and talk things out,” she told me in 1995. “But it takes time. It was probably like part of him dying when Prognosis died.”
They never had that coffee. Welch eventually returned to the United States, where, he says, he parlayed what he called the “quasi-presentable” reputation he earned in Prague into a career in journalism. The Prague Post continues to publish digitally, though it shed its print edition in 2013. Welch says he holds no grudge against Frankenberg. “Why? Competition’s good, man! It made both papers better. And because I, unlike her, can look at myself in the mirror every night before going to sleep without so much as a twinge of doubt of how I comported myself professionally in my early twenties. She won the battle, for which she deserves real credit. But history will not remember her paper nearly the same way, and that just makes me smile and smile.”
IN 1995, MANY Prognosis staffers and alumni were less sanguine. True, the city had become faster, harder, more expensive and less forgiving: the free market that had made Prognosis possible had killed it. But it was tempting to conclude Welch and the others had squandered what they had built—a newspaper that everyone who worked there had come to consider their own.
“These American kids start the first English-language newspaper. … It can’t help but thrive, right?” Welch’s friend, Ken Layne, told me in an e-mail in 1995. “It sputters along for several years, getting a million dollars in free press, no business plan, no financial plan, no discipline, just bumbling along, just like all of Prague is doing. And just like the fucking Communists, Prognosis is living off subsidies,” a reference to the money from relatives and foundations in the United States. “Meanwhile, the Czechs figure it all out. They toss away a lifetime of anti-capitalist bullshit and turn Prague into a fucking money machine. Everybody figures out how to run a business, how to make cash, how to succeed — everybody but these American kids who refuse to even acknowledge the need for money, for success.
“If Lisa Frankenberg is your villain,” Layne added, “you’ve bought into the biggest piece of fabricated history ever. If they had figured out how to use Lisa’s smarts … Prognosis would be a thriving media empire today instead of a dead newspaper fondly remembered by fifty people. The results speak for themselves. Lisa is no monster. A hundred other people have felt the same way about the half-ass manner in which Prognosis was run.”
When I remind Layne of those comments almost two decades later, he explains that “one of my habits of my youth was to get good and drunk and pissed off while typing. It was, I guess, my literary style of the era.” In 1995, he says, he was still bitter about his aborted return to Prague. “I was supposed to be editor of a paper I loved in the Czech Republic, and instead I was drifting around.”
Layne still doesn’t blame Frankenberg for the paper’s demise: she left in 1991, and the paper took another four years to fold, he points out, plenty of time to have turned things around. But he is more forgiving of Welch and company. “While I’ve lost touch with all but a dozen or so of the Prognosis gang, those dozen people remain some of my best friends,” he says. “The group of Californians and Czechs who started up that paper did a pretty good job with intolerable circumstances.” Even in 1995, at his most frustrated, Layne said of them, “they are good people, and that Prague experience remains incredibly significant. It reverberates through every part of my life.”
CHRISTOPHER SCHEER’S FATHER, journalist Robert Scheer, urged the Prognosis founders in 1994 “to just become an Internet newspaper,” Welch says, “which would have been way ahead of the curve.” Instead, because the paper died at almost the precise moment the Internet became a mass phenomenon, there is no online archive or digital database of its five-year run. Former employees now speak of a complete set of printed issues the way one recounts an urban legend: the full run is always sitting in the basement of the friend of a friend, just out of reach. So Prognosis, as an iteration of young, earnest, idealistic journalism, cannot be considered in its entirety, but only in pieces. A virtual collection of yellowed issues lies scattered across the globe, a notional scrapbook of clippings, impressions, half-memories and fading photographs.
In the twenty years since its demise, my picture of Prognosis has evolved from a lost opportunity into something else. As a bit player, I too was frustrated to see it fold. Today, I no longer imagine an alternate history in which Prognosis survived the nineties: I just marvel at the audacity of its brief, improbable existence. During one gloomy period in 1993, Christopher Scheer wrote in a memo to the staff that the paper was not “a normal institution. … Stability is not its primary, overriding goal. Those who seem to wish Prognosis was some great gleaming ship of stable corporate love — including myself at many an exhausted moment — would not want to work at such a place.” The founders of Prognosis gave us a life-changing experience; they didn’t owe us permanence.
Any outcome would be an adventure and therefore a success, Scheer had said. And so the sharp edges of the picture soften to something else: a moment, ephemeral but real, in the dusty swirl of post-1989 Central Europe. Lyle Zimskind, a managing editor of the Czech edition of Esquire, would remember Prognosis as “chaotically managed” but “livelier” than the Post — a victory by any measure, except that of for-profit survival.
In his 1990 letter, Scheer had advocated “not running this like a business but like a movement.” And every movement runs its course. Welch made not only his daydreams come to life, but those of every other expat who saw their work — their words, their whimsy, their passion — on those pages. “Prognosis was an expression of pure newspaper romanticism,” he says. “The whole thing was an expression of love for the form.”
“The paper failed,” writer Logan Mabe would conclude, “but it wasn’t a failure.”
IN LATE 2011, Welch, now the editor-in-chief of Reason, a Washington libertarian magazine, returned to Prague to attend the funeral of his idol, Václav Havel. Havel’s English translator, Paul Wilson, had secured him a seat inside St. Vitus Cathedral, the imposing Gothic structure at Prague Castle that dominates the city skyline.
Outside the gates, hundreds of thousands normally taciturn Czechs were mourning their hero. They were part of the West now, part of the European Union and of NATO, and though Havel’s popularity had faded before he left the presidency in 2003, his reputation for principle was intact — unlike that of his rival, Klaus, whose government was eventually tainted by corruption scandals. And so, though the end of Communism had produced many complications and disappointments, the citizens of Prague crowded the streets for Havel’s funeral procession, wrapping the city in the same atmosphere of possibility they created in 1989.
In a piece for Reason’s website, Welch reflected on what Havel had inspired, not in Welch himself, but in the Czech capital. “From the Velvet Revolution through at least 1991, and in many (though lesser) respects for years after, Prague was alive with rediscovery and experimentation in the exciting, difficult, anarchic interlude between Communism and its built-out replacement,” he wrote. “More than mere nostalgia for a limited era of time (one I was fortunate enough to participate in), that same spirit of, well, love, or at least its handmaiden decency, has never really gone away.”
The newspaper was never far from Welch’s mind during his quick return to Prague. “That forty-eight hours I spent there was a profound moment, one I absolutely lived up to by drinking until 5 a.m. the night before the funeral with a bunch of ex-Prognosis comrades, and then vomiting inside the castle after the religious ceremony, and also, again, under the Charles Bridge on the walk back,” he told me. “Friends from New York told me to do it right, in their honor, and so I did.”
“Prague is beautiful like an insecure woman,” Prognosis staffer Kate Sullivan once wrote. “It doesn’t seem to realize the crazy extent of its beauty; it doesn’t notice the effect it has on people.” But everyone who ever worked at the paper realized it. They still do.
“To this day,” Welch says, “I reject the term ‘the real world,’ because my feeling is that we should all strive for the surrealism that we were able to enjoy in early-nineties Prague.”

Our experiences traveling through Prague
Prague is the complete opposite of Berlin. While Berlin is modern and hip, Prague still maintains its old town charms and traditional values. At first glance, Prague appears to be frozen in time thanks to its beautiful old buildings, castles and town squares that have survived the past few world wars.
However, after delving deeper into the city we soon realised that the entire Old Town and Castle Quarter were populated by tourists. Most locals in these areas were people working in the tourism industry and shop retailers. I have mixed feelings about Prague. I may be slightly biased by the fact that we both fell ill for two whole days in Prague, but mostly I think it’s because unlike Berlin, we didn't really get to experience a lot (if any) of the local scenes in Prague.
CONS:
PROS:
Having visited 4 countries already as I write this, Prague stands out as the most distinct and beautiful old city. The Old Town (Stare Mesto)is the centerpiece of Prague, intact with beautiful heritage buildings exudes an air of romance at nightfall when the orange hued street lamps lights up the streets of Old Town. Walking around Old Town Square in the evening felt abit like being in a fairytale.
Also for the opera and theatre fans, the tickets to a show were very reasonable (approx 10–15euros) compared to Vienna. We didn’t manage to catch a show, however reading online it would appear that Prague offers a good and cheaper alternative for classical music plays.
Castle Quarter (Hradcany) is a Unesco heritage site known for Prague Castle located in this area and the surrounding sights which are packed with Czech history. Castle Quarter dominates the skyline of Prague as it is located on a hill on the other side of River Vltava. Aside from the multitude of historical museums, cathedral and castle buildings to visit, Castle Quarter also offers the best vantage point for photography. Get yourself a combi ticket at Prague Castle to get the most out of your visit. Some of the notable mentions were captured in the photos below.
Unfortunately our appetites have shrunk in Prague. As mentioned earlier, we fell sick and were homebound for two whole days out of our week long duration in Prague. That could be the cause of our lack of foodie finds, but generally Prague didn’t impress us much in the food aspect. The foodie scene was not as evolved as its neighbouring cities, so fusion or international cuisines were not as plentiful. Their traditional meals are generally meat and potatoes with not much greens on the plate. I’m all for trying new food and traditional cuisines, but I can now conclude that Prague’s traditional fares are just not for me.

My brother and I decided to establish the headquarters of our tech company in Prague. It was the best decision we’ve ever made.
People who have visited Prague before can confirm that it’s an astonishing city with impressively clean streets, stunning architecture, diverse cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife. But most people are only now starting to realize that Prague is also a hidden gem for tech companies.
To understand why Prague is just starting to flourish, you have to look back more than 100 years and understand a bit of Czech history.
Throughout its history, the Czech Republic has always been a prominent economic player in Europe. In the early 20th century, it was actually an industrial powerhouse and held 10th place in the world industrial production. It was only after World War 2 when the Czech Republic became occupied by the Soviet Union and then ruled by communism, that its economy started to halter.
However, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully ended communism, the Czech Republic reestablished democracy and a market economy. Since then (over the last 30 years) the Czech economy has been growing at an impressive pace and it now proudly produces the most GDP per capita in comparison to all other post-communist countries.
Prague also has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, at just 1.3%.
Looking back at the last 30 years and seeing how much progress the Czech Republic has made leaves me and everybody living in Prague excited about the future.
The Czech Republic boasts a great education system.
I myself spent a few years in the Czech Republic during high school and can confirm it from first-hand experiences. When I was transferring over from my school in the US, I had to spend the whole summer catching up on algebra, physics, and chemistry just so that I could join the same age students and didn’t have to stay a year back.
Getting a university education in the Czech Republic is free, which gives the opportunity for everyone to enroll and lifts the education level across the whole population. The free education system also attracts many foreign students who wouldn’t have been able to afford an education at home.
Czech universities also have very high-quality computer science and mathematics programs, which serves as a solid foundation for future software engineers. The mathematics programs are especially key for those students who later on pursue careers in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
HackerRank, a California-based service that runs tests for software engineers, ranked Czech engineers 2nd in the world in mathematical challenges which reflect their skill in functional programming.
The Czech engineers ranked 9th in the world overall. The US ranked 13th.
If you’re reading this article and you’re sitting in a large US metropolitan area, you’re probably used to long commute times and have just accepted traffic as part of your life, as I did when I was living in the Bay Area. Prague doesn’t have this issue.
Its public transport system is ranked 5th in the world and is used by over two thirds of the city’s population. It has an affordable, yet sophisticated train, metro, tram and bus system, allowing you to comfortably get around the city within minutes.
Prague is located in the heart of Europe and has direct flight connections to all other major European cities such as Paris, London, or Amsterdam. Flight times are all under 2h and usually cost between $50 — $250 round trip.
Prague is gradually becoming a global metropolis and is catching up to cities like Paris and Amsterdam, however, it is still incomparable when it comes to prices and is, therefore, a great place to work and live. You can afford to live a high standard of life with an average Prague salary, especially if you’re working in tech.
I ran a price comparison of San Francisco vs. Prague (my two hometowns) and this is where we’ve landed (1):
It’s also tough to get bored in Prague. It’s an energetic city with endless cool events to attend. If you’re into contemporary art exhibits, prosecco festivals, local food markets, underground techno raves, or just into chilling in the park enjoying the castle view, you’ve got it.
Over recent years, Prague has attracted a lot of foreigners and now has a thriving expat community, which makes up more than 25% of Prague’s workforce. Plenty of Americans and Brits have decided to move here as well and surprisingly in some districts you now hear English on the streets and at cafes more often than Czech.
We’re witnessing the Prague startup scene flourish.
Just over the past few months, we’ve seen Prague startup productboard raise a $45,000,000 Series B round led by Sequoia Capital, Twisto, an emerging fintech startup raise $15,000,000 and Rossum, a startup extracting data from invoices and documents using machine learning, raise $4,500,000.
If you’re just launching your tech startup and are having trouble with hiring the right technical talent, or are shocked by the high prices and burn rate you’ll have in an oversaturated tech hub like Silicon Valley, you might want to consider making Prague your new home.
Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn. I’ll be happy to give you tips and tricks for Prague. I’ve been here for almost 4 years and moving here was the best decision I’ve made.

Southeast Asia is so much popular and we can read about those ideal places for nomadic lifestyle in almost every second interview with some digital nomad. It has been many years like that but today more digital nomads are tired of Asia and want to try something else.
Why not?
Location independent lifestyle is not about living in Asia.
I know, South East Asia is perfect. It is so cheap! It is fun! There are beaches! You will escape from stress…
It might be true, but why should I stay there for the rest of my life? Yeah, let's go there, experience that, but why settle there?
Digital nomads can work from anywhere, so they tend to move every month or two months. Their “moving out/in factor” is very deep inside of them.
For those who are from Australia or New Zeland it is obvious that they prefer Indonesia, Malaysia or South East Asia. But what about US citizens? Coming to Europe is not hard for them. They ask for a Shengen visa and can travel within all EU members during the period of 3 months.
Many of them know right now and the word of mouth is getting spread out.
This is just a beginning. Let's dig deeper why you will meet more digital nomads in Prague nowadays than ever before. Prague is indeed becoming one of the most popular hub for digital nomads.
The climate in the Czech Republic is very nice for all three season (spring, summer, autumn). Of course most digital nomads are coming during summer. Winter is not a favourite season while you are in the city. Anyway the location of Prague can guarantee very pleasant weather conditions.
Moreover there are no earthquakes or any other dangerous nature occasions.
Prague's architecture is amazing. Many says that Prague is the heart of Europe and the most beautiful city in the whole Europe. And it is true! If you don't believe me, you should google some images from Prague.
The Czech Republic lies in the middle of Europe, you can decide if it is eastern or western Europe. Don't forget bring this topic when you sit with a beer with some Czech. You will have fun, that's for sure :-)
The infrastructure in Prague is very modern. The transportation is easy and as a english speaking traveller you won't have a bigger problems.
Yeah, we do speak english. It is not our official language, but most young people can speak very good english. You can meet lots of foreigners in Prague as well.
When you are lost, you simply ask for a direction in the nearest shop and will get an answer.
There are many coworking spaces in Prague. You can choose if you prefer bigger space or maybe smaller coworking.
The price is around 10 Euro/1 hour or 130 Euro/month.
I can recommend you Locus Coworking or Impact Hub.
Plenty of events are going on every day in Prague. Either business's topics or topics for self-improvement. The good thing about coworking spaces in Prague is that they are not just for work but they really connect you with other interesting people. The staff do lots of events, so make sure you will check them out.
You can find many cultural events in the city as well.
Prague is a place where to party, that is for sure. Prague is very famous because travellers go party here. Some come to Prague just to party. I am serious!
Well, if you come here, it is definitely recommended to experience that. The buzz is cheap and there are tons of clubs.
Work hard, party hard!

Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, has a lot to offer for visitors from culture, architecture, food, and drink.

Prague offers beautiful views, gothic architecture, and plenty of things to do for tourists.
If you are planning a Euro trip, you must stop in Prague. Prague is one of the favorite and most beautiful cities in Europe. I have made a list of 6 free things to do in Prague. Let’s take a look …
Old Town Square is voted as the most beautiful square in the world. There are so many things to do, and the architecture is stunning.

Last summer, when the spring lockdown temporarily lifted, we engaged in a bit of an ‘empty Prague tourism.’ It’s surprising how little I get to see the city’s historical parts — I mostly avoid them because they are full of tourists. Prague is wonderful (so I understand that people want to see it), and the distinctive landmarks like Charles Bridge or Old Town Square are usually packed. And so that’s where we decided to go.
We started our stroll at the beautiful Kampa island. With its maze of tiny streets and an old watermill, it’s one of my favorite places in Prague. We didn’t go as far as the famous Lennon wall, but we enjoyed the poetry booth on the edge of the park instead. This invention is one of the indigenous ideas of Ondrej Kobza, who is also behind the Prague street piano initiative and is always looking for ways to make the city more interesting. Needless to say, I am a fan.
From Kampa, we headed to the Charles Bridge. I was curious about how many people would be there — after all, we were not the only ones on the empty city sightseeing bandwagon. As it turned out, it wasn’t completely devoid of explorers like us, but there were very few people.
The Charles Bridge is usually a bustling hub of activity with its sides lined by various stalls and the space between them filled by a mass of people. You can move only at a slow pace here — together with the crowd. I have never seen it as empty as that day.
We crossed the Charles Bridge and got to the Old Town Square and its famous astronomical clock. When I was a little child, my parents sometimes took me there to see the renowned moving figurines of the twelves apostles, a display that plays out at the end of every hour. But we always had to stand on our tiptoes in the middle of the crowd to see them.
This time was different. We picked the restaurant directly across the astronomical clock, sat at an outside table, ordered lunch, and waited for the whole spectacle to begin.
I have never ever thought that I would be eating in one of the Old Town Square restaurants. Usually, they are full of tourists, and the prices are astronomical — no pun intended. Today though, the restaurant was half-empty and the prices reasonable. And the food was delicious too! I was glad to find out they served a vegetarian burger, and I can definitely recommend it. If you are interested, the name of the restaurant is El Toro Negro.
We slowly ate our lunch, and then the astronomical clock awakened, and everything suddenly set to motion. The twelve apostles moved behind the little windows, a figure of a skeleton that represents death beckoned at us with its little scythe, and the cockerel that symbolizes life ended the spectacle with its crowing. It was pretty nostalgic because I haven’t been here for a long time.
At the end of our excursion, we decided to visit the main Prague library around the corner from Old Town Square. We had a particular reason for it — in the lobby is a sculpture that I love, and Ben has never seen it before. It is a tower built from old books stretching from the floor to the ceiling. Inside of it are two mirrors that reflect the picture, so when you look inside, you see a book tunnel that stretches into eternity.
I never get tired of this sight. Ben was properly amazed. We are a pair of bookworms, so we can never pass on a sight like this. And it was a great conclusion to a well-spent day as tourists in our own city. It was a fun thing to do, and I think we will try to repeat it more often from now on, Covid or not. After all, Prague is a beautiful city, and I should realize more often how lucky I am to live here.

All by myself: Where to Get Coffee as an Introvert in Prague,https://medium.com/@katerynabasina/all-by-myself-where-to-get-coffee-as-an-introvert-in-prague-ce8fc26d205,"Sign up

It seems illogical that an introvert should love going out. And yet we do. However, we often go out for reasons contrary to why extrovert’s head to the nearest bar. It is not a journey to meet someone or get social, it is a time to engage in a solitary activity and dive into the inner world of thought, perceptions and sensations. Whenever an extrovert goes out to make a new acquaintance, an introvert will often prefer to read a book, do some writing or appreciate the multitude of tastes that his food offers him.
The Internet abounds in advice on how to dine like an introvert. Some of it is quite amusing, like:
While you may choose to follow or disregard this advice, I suggest you head to a cafe anyway. Here’s my list of cafes in Prague where you can have a decent cup of coffee and be left alone, if that’s what your heart desires.
Mama coffee
I found Mama coffee by chance. I wanted to have a look at a New Town Tower and followed the Vodičkova street heading to Vaclavske namesti. On my right I saw big steel-framed windows and cosy tables inside, so I gave it a chance. At the time I was starting to get desperate about finding decent coffee in Prague.
This place is more than simply good coffee in the city center (and believe me when I say finding good coffee is not as easy as it might seem). It has a great vibe due to the abundance of green plants, vintage furniture and photographs on the walls. It was there that my husband and I bought two framed photographs by František Beneš — a mysterious Czech photographer who voyaged across Europe and Africa and captured people and life at the turn of the century. Why is Beneš mysterious? His photo negatives have only recently been discovered and archived by another Czech photographer, Martin Wágner, but there is little information about Beneš himself.
It was in this caffee I saw a girl with Jack Russell and I had a thought that it was the very dog breed I needed. The Asian girl was sitting on a stool at a bar, slowly retracting dog biscuits from a pocket of her black jacket and feeding it to a dog who was watching her with lively and attentive eyes. The universe works in unique ways, and a day later we got Josef from a shelter, who is a mix of a Jack and a daschund, our misbehaving and beloved pup.
The café has solid desserts and very affordable house wines, so you can safely hide away in a corner with a book or with your work on a laptop.
Neustadt
Minus: they don’t serve coffee after 7 p.m. except for filtered coffee.
Plus: enchanting courtyard. If you are lucky enough you might even hear some music — there is a piano open for public to play. When the sounds fill up the courtyard, it is the most enchanting experience. The music will play its charm upon you.
Neustadt is a hipster place and rightly so. Just sit down and listen to how the voices of people around you echo from the walls of the courtyard. Look at the grapes on the adjacent wall and the little tower which will make you think a Rapunzel might actually feel quite comfortable here.
Literární kavárna Retêzova
If you find yourself in that very hellish part of town which is swarmed with tourists, you’ll crave to end up in a quiet place. Well, I’ve got you covered. Retezova street is in the very center but miraculously manages to stay crowd-free. The first time we came to Literarní kavarna was on our first visit to Prague. It was winter and in the middle of the day the place was empty. And so was it on all of my other visits. This is the perfect place to blog away, being inspired by all the black-and-white photographs of writers who used to frequent this place.
Mind you, despite the lack of people the service can be a bit slow — on the other hand, why hurry when you have all day to write that article?
Grand Café Orient
The very building in which Grand Cafe Orient is situated brings you back to an era of Czech cubism — all things pre-war, avant-garde, revolutionary and rebellious. I have never seen anything quite like it in design, and it is easy to see why Czech cubism is something the nation takes pride in — crystalline shapes and unexpected angles of ordinary objects. Its idea was to reject the secessionist architecture and yet if you look closely its aesthetic is as decorative as the style it rejected.
Paradoxically, Grand Cafe Orient on the second floor is less cubist, more art nouveau. The coffee is alright, this is definitely a place for people-watching, tourist-watching, to be precise. Yet the atmosphere lashes your imagination and it runs away like a wild steed into an era where rebelling with art was possible without the phones, but with the work full of expression.
Louvre
I didn’t want to include Louvre first because it defies my theory. At midday, it is definitely not a good place for introverts, because it’s packed with tourists. And even if you do get a place a stranger will most certainly come up and wish to sit with you. And if they sit down, they’ll most certainly engage into conversation with you. It happened to me on my last visit. An American lady, desperate for a lunch spot, sat down on the bench across from me, and as she was doing that already, I offered her to join me for lunch not to seem rude. We had a small talk about this and that — she was living in LA, came to Prague for a screenwriting and poetry workshop — don’t get me wrong, I love meeting artistic people, but it was not what I came to the cafe for. I came to dive into my own inner world, remember?
And yet I could not make a list of my favourite cafes and not include this one. There’s something absolutely tantalising in dining at the same table as Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Karel Čapek and Albert Einstein could have dined. They could have been writing letters, having philosophical readings or using these tables as a temporary office. That link to a different epoch amazes me and makes me fantasise: how different did life feel at that time? Did it feel less hectic? Cruel? Paced? More authentic? More like you owned it because there wasn’t any technology involved? Because you weren’t bombarded by all these little notifications and e-mails and messages that keep your mind in all other possible places but not actually in your life?
As you can see, it is a good place for meditation. As a bonus, this place has the only proper Turkish coffee in Prague, made and served in a proper little copper cezve. Mmm!
Cukrkavalimonada
Simply the best place in Mala Strana (the area of Prague on the other side of Charles Bridge). Especially good for salads, pasta and mouth-watering desserts. Because the tables are so close to each other, also very good for eavesdropping. Once I overheard a conversation between a woman — she was a teacher of Czech — and her date, apparently a “project manager”. I initially thought he was a spy, because he was carefully avoiding all talk about his work, giving vague answers like — “I am from US and work on some projects that have to do with Europe”. But in the end I thought may be he was just an asshole, trying to sound more important than he really was.
Anyway, if you love fresh food with an Italian twist — this place calls upon you. Be sure to bring a decent amount of cash though, as they don’t accept credit cards!
Do you enjoy visiting cafes by yourself? What does your favourite cafe look and feel like? I’d be very curious to know. And if you recommend another atmospherical cafe in Prague, i’ll be more than happy to check it out and include it in my list! Happy cafe-strolling!

Why is Prague so popular? It’s a question that often comes up, and one that is easily answered. With its stunning architecture, vibrant culture, and long history, Prague is one of Europe’s most popular tourist destinations. From its cobblestone streets to its iconic castles, there are many reasons why Prague is so beloved by visitors from around the world. In this blog post, we’ll explore what makes Prague so popular and why it remains a top destination for travelers.
Prague has a fascinating history that spans over a thousand years. Founded in the 9th century, Prague has been a significant political, cultural, and economic center in Europe since its inception. It was once the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and the seat of the Kings of Bohemia.
Throughout its history, Prague has witnessed a plethora of events, from invasions and wars to periods of peace and prosperity. One of the most significant events in the city’s history was the Prague Spring in 1968, a time of political and cultural liberalization, which ended in Soviet intervention.
Another defining moment in Prague’s history was the Velvet Revolution in 1989, which marked the end of communist rule in Czechoslovakia. The revolution was peaceful, and it brought about political and economic reforms that helped transform Prague into the vibrant and cosmopolitan city it is today.
Visitors to Prague can experience the city’s rich history through its many historical sites, such as Prague Castle, the Old Town Square, and the Jewish Quarter. These sites offer a glimpse into the city’s past and the significant events that shaped its history.
Prague is a city steeped in culture, from its rich history to its modern arts scene. The city has been influenced by various cultures throughout its history, including German, Jewish, and Slavic cultures. This has created a unique blend of traditions, art, music, and cuisine that draws in visitors from around the world.
One of the main draws of Prague’s culture is its art scene. The city is home to numerous art galleries and museums, such as the National Gallery and the Museum of Decorative Arts. Prague’s love for the arts can also be seen in its architecture, with numerous buildings boasting impressive designs and intricate details.
Prague is also famous for its traditional cuisine, which includes dishes like goulash, roast pork, and dumplings. Visitors can experience authentic Czech food at local restaurants or try it out for themselves by visiting the city’s farmers’ markets and food stalls.
Aside from its food and art, Prague is also known for its music scene. The city has produced many famous musicians, such as Antonin Dvorak, Bedrich Smetana, and Gustav Mahler. Prague is also home to numerous music festivals, including the Prague Spring International Music Festival, which attracts top musicians and visitors from around the world.
Overall, Prague’s culture is a vibrant and eclectic mix of history, art, music, and food that is truly one-of-a-kind. Visitors to this city will be able to immerse themselves in this unique culture and experience something truly unforgettable.
Prague’s stunning architecture is undoubtedly one of the key reasons why the city is such a popular tourist destination. Throughout the centuries, Prague has been shaped by many different architectural styles, each one contributing to the city’s unique character and charm.
One of the most famous styles of architecture in Prague is Gothic. This style can be seen in many of the city’s churches, including St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle. The cathedral is a breathtaking example of Gothic architecture, with its towering spires and intricate stone carvings.
Another notable style of architecture in Prague is Baroque. This style is known for its grandeur and extravagance, and can be seen in many of the city’s palaces and public buildings. The Clementinum, a complex of historic buildings in the Old Town, is a stunning example of Baroque architecture, with its ornate facades and sweeping staircases.
Of course, Prague Castle is the centrepiece of the city, so don’t miss this incredible building, even if you only have a few hours to spare. Get your Prague Castle skip the line tickets in advance to save even more time.
In addition to these historic styles, Prague also boasts a number of Art Nouveau buildings. This style is characterized by its decorative and ornamental elements, and can be seen in buildings such as the Municipal House, which was built in the early 20th century.
Prague’s architecture is not just limited to grand public buildings and churches. The city’s streets are lined with beautiful and colorful houses, many of which have intricate stonework and decorative details. The Old Town Square is a great example of this, with its colorful facades and charming cobblestone streets.
Hop on a Prague guided tour to experience the city’s best buildings.
Prague has a magical and romantic atmosphere that draws in visitors from all over the world. The cobblestone streets, gothic buildings, and romantic bridges all contribute to this city’s enchanting vibe. Prague’s atmosphere can best be experienced by wandering around the city’s streets, soaking up its ambiance.
The old town square, located in the heart of the city, is a particularly atmospheric spot. Visitors can admire the impressive buildings surrounding the square, take a break at a quaint café, and listen to the chimes of the Astronomical Clock. The Charles Bridge is another great place to experience Prague’s atmosphere. The bridge’s views of the Vltava River, the castle, and the city skyline are breathtaking, and the street musicians and artists that populate the bridge make it an exciting place to be.
One of the best things about Prague’s atmosphere is that it’s present day and night. In the daytime, the city’s vibrant energy and buzzing markets are a delight to explore. But at night, Prague transforms into an entirely different city. The streetlights illuminate the gothic buildings, casting shadows on the streets below. The atmosphere is quieter, more intimate, and altogether more romantic. A night-time walk along the Charles Bridge or a cozy dinner in a local restaurant are unforgettable experiences.
In short, Prague’s atmosphere is a mixture of history, romance, and a touch of the mysterious. The city’s magic is best experienced by wandering its streets and soaking up its ambiance. There is simply no other city quite like Prague.
Last but not least, the people of Prague contribute greatly to the city’s popularity as a tourist destination. Prague locals are known for their friendliness, warmth, and hospitality, making visitors feel welcomed and comfortable during their stay.
As one of the most culturally diverse cities in Europe, Prague attracts people from all walks of life, including expats, international students, and travelers from around the world. This vibrant mix of cultures and nationalities adds to the city’s appeal, making it a hub of diversity and creativity.
Moreover, the people of Prague are proud of their city’s heritage and are always eager to share their stories and traditions with visitors. Whether you’re exploring the historic streets or enjoying a night out at a local pub, you’re likely to meet locals who are passionate about their city and willing to show you around.
In addition, Prague is a safe city with low crime rates, which contributes to a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. Visitors can explore the city at their own pace and feel safe while doing so.
All in all, the people of Prague are a vital part of what makes this city so popular. Their friendliness, cultural diversity, and passion for their city create an unforgettable experience for visitors, making Prague a must-see destination in Europe.
Overall, Prague is a truly unique and special city, with a fascinating history, stunning architecture, rich culture, and a lively atmosphere that attracts visitors from all over the world. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply looking to experience a new culture, Prague has something for everyone.

It’s a cold, sunny day in mid-January, and I’m sitting on a frosty barstool outside, sipping the hot mulled wine the Czechs call Svařák.
I can see the colorful Astronomical Clock about thirty feet away, built by Master Mikuláš Kadaň in the early 1400s, with the Church of Our Lady of Týn looming above Old Town Square.
Across the narrow cobblestone street stands the ornate house, dubbed the Minute House, where the influential writer Franz Kafka spent his early childhood.
As always, there is a constant flow of people bustling about, wrapped in parkas and earmuffs, moving into and out of the beautiful square. Many people stop every hour to watch the Twelve Apostles appear at the top of the Astronomical Clock.
It’s busy but not too crowded, yet more proof that the best time to travel is in the winter, when prices are low, tourists scarce and you can appreciate what a place has to offer.
I’ve come to Prague to escape the Covid madness still gripping much of the United States and the West — and the increasingly aggressive propaganda of the corporate media.
My grandchildren needed someone to take them back to London after their annual Christmas visit, and I instantly volunteered.
With my American Express travel points, I could get a ticket almost for free — and prices for a week-long visit in Prague were too good to pass up. My hotel right on the Old Town Square, with its large ornate bedrooms and funky statues of angels with swords, cost me just $83 per night, breakfast included. I couldn’t afford to stay home.
I did have to take not one but five separate Covid tests and demonstrate a near-professional knowledge of computers to clear the bureaucratic hurdles, but I sailed through Czech Immigration with hardly a glance.
After breakfast, I work in the mornings on my laptop and then spend the afternoons exploring the city — Prague Castle and the magnificent St. Vitus Cathedral on the hill, the medieval Charles Street bridge, the Museum of Communism, the shape-shifting steel statue of Kafka’s head by the artist David Černý, the National Museum near Wenceslas Square, the Jewish Quarter.
I pay the obligatory visit to an Absentherie, tasting the once-forbidden Green Fairy, and take a cruise out on the Moldau River.
What strikes me the most is the upbeat, freer atmosphere in Prague.
As much as the US prides itself on its love of liberty, the truth is that there is more freedom now in Eastern Europe than in many countries in the West or in places like Australia.
Some tourists wear face masks but most of the Czechs do not. Life has returned to normal here in Central Europe, and the smiling faces and friendly greetings of dobrý den on the street stand in marked contrast to what you see in locked-down Los Angeles, New York or Chicago.
After nearly a week, I have been asked only once for my digital Covid Passport, and, when the scanner couldn’t read the QR Code from the U.S., the waitress just shrugged her shoulders and let me in anyway.
The thing about the Czech Republic is that its people had more than 40 years’ experience dealing with Communist governments and their insane bureaucratic demands, from 1948 up until the Velvet Revolution threw the dictators out of power in 1989. Once you’ve dealt with Soviet tanks rolling down your streets, as happened in Prague in 1968, Covid insanity is small beer.
The other aspect to Prague that both delights and unsettles me is how safe and clean the city is. The streets are spotless, the centuries-old architecture magnificent and the buildings freshly painted.
There are no homeless visible on the streets at all, although you do occasionally see a beggar kneeling with his forehead touching the ground, hat or cup obsequiously raised upward for a donation. Young women walk the dark alleyways and cobblestone streets late at night, seemingly unafraid.
In contrast, on the car trip to Los Angeles for my flight here, there were entire tent cities tucked underneath the freeway overpasses, mounds of garbage piled ten feet high. Violent crime in American cities is skyrocketing, thanks to the “defund the police” movement and the election of “decriminalize everything” leftist prosecutors.
In other words: Prague shows you that cities don’t have to be cesspools of crime, violence and uncollected garbage. Instead, they can be havens of culture, beauty and neighborliness. The ethnic hatreds and identity politics that are tearing America and countries like the UK apart are absent here.
In the end, this trip is restoring my faith in humanity — and in the possibility, at least, that big cities can be livable again.
If the relatively poor Czech Republic can afford cities of unparalleled beauty and serenity, surely the vastly more affluent United States can do the same.
The lesson I take from Prague, therefore, is that there is hope for the future.
If the Czech people were able to remove authoritarian, surveillance-obsessed bureaucrats from power in a peaceful, nonviolent revolution, so, too, can liberty-loving Americans. Hopefully, it won’t take us 40 years.

I lived in the greater Seattle area for three years. I’ve lived in Prague for five months. Here’s my take on the wins and losses in both countries.
1Topic: SmokingWinner: Seattle
As a lifelong non-smoker, I define a country’s smoking success as having less of a smoking culture. Compared to the US, Prague has a huge smoking culture. According to data from the Czech National Cancer Control Programme, about 25% of Czechs smoke, compared to approximately 15% of Americans.
Anecdotally, I’ve noticed much more smoking on the sidewalks, in parks, and in the outdoor sections of restaurants in Prague than in the US. Every time I walk through a smoke cloud in Prague, I long for the US.
2Topic: DogsWinner: Prague
If you’re a dog-lover, Prague has two really awesome parts of dog culture that make it better than the US:
3Topic: Dog PoopWinner: Seattle
Czechs don’t pick up dog poop. :( I almost had to stop picking up my dog’s poop in Prague because I physically could not find anywhere to buy poop bags and could not consistently find publicly-provided ones. For months, I lived off the supply I brought from the US, then finally restocked when I was on vacation in Asia.
But don’t take my word for it. A reply on a TripAdvisor forum went as far as to encourage people to not pick up dog poop, as it labeled you as a foreigner. And this poignant excerpt from the Czech Expats page, titled “Poo Fighters” (the Seattlite in me approves of the title), explains the issue even better:
There’s the issue of doggy do-do. However positively disposed you are towards our four-legged friends, no-one enjoys stepping in a steaming pile of poop. Yet despite all those green disposal bins supplied with free brown, erm, doggy bags, some owners persistently fail to clear up after their pets… Matters have become so serious that Prague 7’s district council is considering DNA testing feces at the scene of the crime in order to track down the responsible pooches.
I don’t think I’ve ever stepped in dog poop in the US. In Prague, I’ve stepped in it more than half a dozen times. Get your shit together, Prague. Literally.
4Topic: Public TransportWinner: Prague
If you want reliable, dependable, and affordable public transport, Prague is an easy choice. On a normal weekday, if you miss your metro, the next one is only two minutes away. Two. Minutes. From this list of best global public transportation, Prague ranks within the top 25:
In the US, conversely, public transport is a nightmare of inconsistent times on incomplete routes. I can personally speak to the abhorrent public transportation Pittsburgh offered during my college years; with the minor experience I’ve accumulated, I can also briefly speak to Seattle’s public transport. That said, with the exception of New York, none of them compares with any of the public transport systems I’ve used in Europe. For the curious, Now This News covered the historical reasons why the US is transportationally behind the rest of the world (summary: we chose highways).
5Topic: Health CareWinner: Prague
I caught a lung infection within my first two months in Prague. I went to the doctor but didn’t have my work-supplied insurance card yet. They charged me without insurance for an emergency, unscheduled visit with a nurse practitioner. I approached the checkout desk post-appointment, waiting for the immense sans-insurance bill. As I stood, cringing, watching the lips of the receptionist read out my balance, seemingly in slow motion, it was… $35. Without insurance.
In the US, my boyfriend had some blood tests done in a scheduled appointment and was charged $1,500 post-insurance. Prague obviously wins here.
It’s not just cost, however. It’s also coverage. In the Czech Republic, every citizen is by-default insured. In the US, over 10% of adults do not have health insurance. Health insurance for all is definitely a win.
You go, Czech Republic.
6Topic: Automatic Sliding DoorsWinner: Seattle
Sliding doors in the Czech Republic have two major issues:
In the US, sliding doors open in such a way that you just keep walking, and the doors will move to not impede your pace. Czech doors, in contrast, will open after you’ve been standing in front of them for a few seconds. On my first day in Prague I tried to enter a mall, but the sliding doors weren’t sliding. I figured the mall was still closed. It wasn’t. I just didn’t wait long enough for the sliding doors to engage. I texted my American friend living in Denmark about it. She confirmed that European sliding doors just suck.
I only have anecdotal and social evidence to back up my claims, however, I know I’m not the only one to have noticed this. I don’t know this person, but based on their rant, I can tell we’re soulmates in another life:
2. The doors have different opening widths depending on the season
Czech sliding doors open less in winter. I get it, they save energy. However, this algorithm has a ton of problems. First, you get used to one opening width and then have to acclimate to another. This wouldn’t be a problem, except that you’re usually not paying much attention to the doors when walking through them. Suddenly — SURPRISE. They unexpectedly open narrower than they used to and you walk into the door. I wish I were kidding, but the sliding glass doors at my work cracked in the winter, I presume for this very reason.
And second, the narrow width is a huge bottleneck. Luckily, waiting outside doors in the winter is one of my favorite pastimes. Oh wait, it’s not.
Get with it Prague.
7Topic: Drinking CultureWinner: Prague
US drinking law: No open alcohol on the streets, absolutely no open containers in cars, and .08 BAC to drive. And that .08 BAC is something a drunk person has to self-gauge. Ne dobry (that means “not good” in Czech).
Prague drinking law: Open alcohol containers are mostly legal, open containers in the car are fine as long as the driver doesn’t partake, and drivers must have 0 BAC. There’s no tolerance for drunk driving, or even buzzed driving, in the Czech Republic. 👍
The Prague drinking laws make Czech drinking culture less restrictive for people enjoying responsibly. Additionally, they’re not so strict that they ironically encourage more drinking, like in the US, where paper-bagging alcohol or hiding alcohol in a bottle of Gatorade is a common sight. And finally, the zero-tolerance rule for drivers makes drunk driving less prevalent in Europe.
In the US, alcohol is involved in 23% of traffic-related deaths. In the Czech Republic, that same statistic is 4%. And the Czech Republic is one of the worst offenders in the EU.
8Topic: ShoppingWinner: Seattle
You know what I miss about the US? Target. Need to find some obscure household item? Target has it. Target doesn’t have it? Amazon surely does.
What happens in the Czech Republic? Well, if you want to find that same obscure household item… well, you can go to… fuck it, I don’t know. There are no major shopping centers like Target or Walmart. Think you can turn to Amazon next? Nope, there’s no Amazon in the Czech Republic. Your only options are to use Germany’s Amazon service, or the Czech Republic’s Amazon equivalent, Alza.cz.
I miss you, US shopping. ❤
9Topic: TechnologyWinner: Seattle
One of Prague’s charms is its rustic, classic look. The streets are still cobblestone, the buildings are still original. Apparently, Prague is so beautiful that Hitler himself was inspired to spare it. Consequently, it’s one of the few places in this part of Europe that wasn’t bombed in WWII, so it’s one rarity that preserved its vintage appearance.
Unfortunately, that old-school culture also makes Prague lag the rest of the world in adoption and prevalence of technology. Do you enjoy elevators? Get ready to use some slow, old, questionable elevators that you’re not sure will hold your weight. The one in my apartment building doesn’t even have up or down buttons — just a call button. When my dog chewed up my laptop charging cord, I quickly found out I couldn’t get a replacement in the Czech Republic (luckily, my work had an extra lying around). When I lost my Fitbit charger, I was forced to order one from Amazon Germany.
This carries on to other parts of daily life. When I was apartment hunting, almost nobody accepted emails. You had to call, and calling meant you had to speak Czech. Welp.
Welcome to the shitshow that is the Czech technology scene. Missing you rn, America.
10Topic: Customer ServiceWinner: Seattle
Need help at a store? Czechs don’t give a fuck. Want a shopping cart? Gotta put in a coin to get one. Want a bag for your items? Gotta pay for that too. Need a restroom while shopping? Get ready to pay again.
Generally, Czech store representatives and systems are ruder, less-helpful, and more prohibitive than in the US. It’s even worse if they figure out you’re a foreigner.
Check out this poignant quote and related article with more formalized data on Czech customer service:
In the Czech Republic, a basic lack of understanding of the minimum level of courtesy required when dealing with the public seems all too widespread — and it’s costing companies dearly. A survey by telecommunications firm Genesys estimates that Czech businesses lose 1.08 billion US dollars annually because of substandard customer service.
11Topic: Elderly CommunityWinner: Prague
Perhaps because of the prevalence of public transport and the de-emphasis of cars, elderly people are active and all over Prague. It’s really refreshing to see independent elderly people around the city, a rare sight in the US. If you want to stay active in your senior years, I’d prescribe Prague.
12Topic: BathroomsWinner: Prague
Do you love knowing who’s in the bathroom with you based on the shoes sticking out beneath the stalls? Making eye contact through the stall gap? Do you enjoy people hearing you poop? And hearing other people poop?
Europe has none of these things. Water closets are God’s gift to relieving yourself. They’re little, private, sealed, closed rooms where you can do your business discretely and in peace. Mmmmmm.
The only downside is that Europe has a bad habit of charging for bathrooms. But with bathrooms this delightful, I’ll take it.
Topic: WaterWinner: Seattle
I ask for few things in life. One of them, however, is free, still, ice water without a lemon in it. Seattle gets this. Prague does not. Most Czech restaurants don’t offer free water, and when you ask for water, they offer you the option of still or sparkling. And when your paid-for, over-specified water does arrive, it usually includes a lemon. And no ice. Shame on you Prague.
(I realize that most of this is personal preference. Please indulge my rant)
And there you have it! What I love and don’t love about my two homes, Prague and Seattle. Did you come to the end of this article looking for me to call a winner? I’m sorry to disappoint. Both cities have a special place in my heart.

GETTING MY HAIRCUT while traveling is something that I still can’t take in my stride. Because of this I now look like one of those Barber: What you want? memes. Here’s my easy step-by-step guide on how not to get a haircut in a foreign country. Haircuts, as they say, are 20:20.
There are two key factors you should aim for when truly trying to devastate your hairdo: laziness and language barriers. Thankfully, I achieved both.Laziness, over time, will allow your hair to look odd. It grows this way and that- always unevenly, of course. Eventually, it will evolve to a look bad enough that if you bump into someone you hadn’t seen in a while they feel obliged to ask “Everything okay man?”
By this stage you start to think ‘You know what? A bad haircut probably wouldn’t be worse than this.’(*Note* If you reach this point, remind yourself: a bad haircut is, in fact, much worse).
This morning, I had that incorrect thought. It was time to get a haircut in Prague.
‘The difference between a good haircut and a bad one is a couple of weeks’ my Granny says. As an Irishman, I would never be seen to disagree with my grandmother. But, come to think about it: A travel blog is the safest place to dispute your 93-year old Granny’s opinion and get away with it.
That’s if I was to do it. Which I would not.
As mentioned, my hair was more than unruly. It was bordering on passers-by questioning my mental health. Too short to be long hair; too long to be considered short. I looked tragic.
I had 2 work meetings on Google Hangouts later that day. Not the phone ones in your PJs. Video ones where you need to appear compos mentis.It seemed as good a day as any to smarten up.
I researched some Prague barbers and found plenty. There was an American Expat website that offered some decent options. Weighing them all up, I decided it would be best to procrastinate.
I took a break from helpful research and watched YouTube videos on ‘How To Cut Your Own Hair’ instead. Almost all of them were imitating a David Beckham haircut of one time or other.
Could I do this myself? I had my own lightweight electric razor…
Could I ask my wife, perhaps? Remembering our hostile afternoon in Cape Cod after how I reacted to her previous attempt, I thought better of it. Back to Google.
It ultimately came down to discovering the barbers closest to Prague’s Old Town Square, where I am staying. I reviewed the reviews and set my sights on their sites. One, in particular, seemed slick.
The website and Facebook page gave a good first impression. It spoke to my need to think that I’m cool and stylish at 31. Even the translation for tutto barbuto- ‘fully bearded’- was pretty badass.
Customers drank scotches and smoked shisha in the online pictures. Smoking Hookah isn’t my thing. But drinking scotch while getting a haircut would be great to tick off the bucket list. It was 10am.
My wife Rachael and I embarked on the 6-min journey by foot from the Old Town Square to Tutto Barbuto.
By Prague standards, it was mild although my toes were beginning to lose sensation.
Flecks of snow fell lazily on the streets, too few and far between to ever last.When we found Tutto Barbutto, it was dark and empty. For a moment, I thought it was closed.
Before turning to leave, I hurled a tentative ‘Dobrý den?’ towards the back of the shop. A small woman, maybe 26, emerged immediately, greeting me in Czech.
-I’m sorry, but do you speak English?-No.
We were off to the perfect start.
We were at an impasse. She had been clear she didn’t speak English. I had zero Czech but 2 impending Google Hangouts. Not to mention, the 99 problems growing out of my head. I decided to push through in English.
-Are you open?
-Yes.
That was good enough for me. I removed my coat and scarf then sat into the barber’s chair.
The lady who was about to cut my hair had dark features and a Marilyn Monroe portrait on her inner arm. I produced my phone to show her the picture I had screen-shotted as inspiration for whoever cut my hair.
This screenshot technique always strikes me as awkward. You can’t show them a photo of somebody who is tooooo attractive or it feels as if your drawing comparisons between yourself and the male model staring back at them dreamily from your phone.
Even the act of providing a photo is something I steer clear from when home in Ireland. Doing anything outside what is seen as standard behavior could be met with the most withering critique an Irish person can give a compatriot:
“He’s getting notions about himself”.
Looking at the screenshot, she zoomed in.
“Very fastidious,” I thought.
She could have been thinking “This man has notions,” in Czech.
To reaffirm we were on the same page, I pointed to the side of my head- albeit, an overgrown one- and said “Very short”. Then I helpfully pointed to the top of my head and said “Long”.
I find myself in these lost in translation moments regularly. While in the midst of them, I hope that a sizable smile will fill the gaps and encourage my opposite number to give me the benefit of the doubt while I point at my head and say random words.
-Zero blade?-No, thanks. A one.
I’m sure I held up one finger and accompanied it with another oversmile.
After a quick wash, the razor purred and hairs began to drop. So long, old friends.
She was painstaking and focused, spending what seemed like 15 minutes on the sides alone. It looked terrific. Suddenly the phone rang and she went to retrieve it.
Rachael came over to the chair for a moment and we both talked about how good I looked before the hairdresser returned.
I’m a long term insomniac and the night before had been rough. I had laid awake from 3.30am-7 before giving up the ghost of sleep and getting up to work out. It was only 10.30 in the morning, but I’d already been awake 7 hours. My eyes were heavy.
And now that the adrenaline was wearing off since my hairdresser was so good, I wasn’t sure I would be able to stay awake in the warm barbershop.Snip.
She chopped about three inches from my hair in one fell swoop. She had clearly experienced my universal gesture of point-at-top-of-head-and-say-long though. Or had she? I waited to see.
Snip.
Snip-snip. Snipsnipsnip.
I looked in stunned silence waiting for her to stop. She didn’t.
While I knew I needed a serious cut, I had expected to leave with much more hair to brave the bitter Prague weather. That protective layer of hair now lay on the floor beneath me.
As I write this now, it seems so stupid. Why not just stop her? There was something that was making me give her the benefit of the doubt, though. I felt like she had a plan.
Turns out she really didn’t.
Rach had been on her phone for the last few hellacious minutes. In the mirror, I saw her look up.
“Keith!”
I ignored her call, trying to look calm as if this was all my plan. The man with the plan.
“KEITH” she called again, louder.
I looked at her in eyebrow-raised resignation. Edwina Scissorhands chopped on, oblivious
Rach jumped out of her seat and walked towards the blizzard of hair.
“You’ve cut it too short!”
The hairdresser paused. After a moment she said:
“Was damaged.”
“It’s fine,” I said to no one in particular in consummate Irishness.
And it was fine. Just about as fine as looking like an idiot can be. The strangest think about my Prague haircut was that, at the end, she shaved back my hairline a half-inch or so.
Image of google screenshot for Prague hairdresser and how it turned out.Can you spot the difference between my Prague haircut and the model?When she finished, it didn’t look so bad. I won’t claim I looked good but it could have been worse. Through a combo or blow-drying and hair-spraying, she made it seem like she hadn’t scalped me.
Stepping away from the scene of the massacre, that big broad smile from earlier was a little more difficult to muster. But muster it I did; long enough to pay the 569 Czech Koruna (about $23).
Then I did what any self-respected Irish person would do.I thanked her and left a tip.

Nestled in the heart of Europe, Prague stands as a testament to the seamless fusion of history, architecture, and culture. Its magnetic allure has made it a global sensation, drawing in millions of visitors each year. But what is it about Prague that makes it so popular worldwide?
In the heart of Europe lies Prague, a city that seems to have borrowed pieces of history from various centuries and woven them into its very streets. For those with an appreciation for architecture, Prague is nothing short of a living museum, where each building tells a story of a bygone era.
Gothic, Baroque, and Romanesque Harmony — What makes Prague stand out is its remarkable blend of architectural styles. As you wander through its enchanting streets, you’ll encounter a seamless fusion of Gothic, Baroque, and Romanesque designs. It’s like taking a stroll through time, where every turn unveils a different chapter in the city’s architectural evolution.
Prague Castle: A Symbol of Grandeur — At the pinnacle of this architectural symphony stands the iconic Prague Castle. This colossal structure, overlooking the city, is a testament to centuries of history. Gothic spires reach for the sky, Baroque…

Prague
I had not heard a single negative thing about Prague before arriving — most of the travelers I had encountered prior had preached about how amazing of a city it is. This had my expectations sky-high for the Czech city, which I hereby declare the Interstellar Mistake (Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Hans Zimmer, reality-based space sci-fi… how could it have not been the best film of all time?!) When I only get to visit a place for a few days, my entire perception of it is largely dependent on the weather while I’m there (Ireland is beautifully sunny and warm, in case you were unaware). Unfortunately for me, my visit to Prague was accompanied by clouds, rain, and cold weather.
That said, it still is architecturally a magnificent place, thanks partially to it not being blown up by war. After all the historically significant, gigantic, celebrated churches I’ve seen over the past three months, the Gothic churches of Prague are far and away my favorite. The charred-looking stone and ridiculously intricate gold and black ornamentation stand out prominently above the other buildings of the city. The largest of these, St. Vitus Cathedral, sits in the middle of the Prague castle on the top of a hill overlooking the Vltava river. The castle itself is a pretty well protected peek into the past, with the palace, churches, shops, and residencies that once inhabited the space within the castle walls.
Another thing Prague does do well is public / street art. This is also most definitely in response to Soviet rule of the city. One particular space called the “Lennon Wall” celebrates the freedom to write anything on a public wall without an authority covering it up. Every day, hundreds of people come by and paint their own drawings and words on the wall, which is now feet thicker due to so many coats of paint. Beyond this street art, there are many humorous statues with implied political meaning, such as giant bronze babies with barcodes instead of faces, and two men urinating in a pool shaped as the Czech Republic. I don’t exactly remember the point of that one, but it’s funny nonetheless. Hopefully one day I’ll be able to return to Prague under clearer weather and lower expectations, and be able to thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the place.

Prague is beautiful and it never lets you go. If you are lucky enough to visit it, then likely you will end up doing the same things the majority of the tourists do: sightsee Prague Castle, shop at the Old Town square, take a picture near the John Lennon wall and cross Charles Bridge.
There is nothing wrong with checking all the “touristy attractions”, but there is just so much more to Prague, and I would not like you to miss that. When you take a few steps away from Prague’s most famous spots— a world brimming with lively culture opens up.
I was born in Prague and even if I lived in other cities, Prague will be always my hometown. It is a beautiful and unique city with many things to do and see. I will show you some secret, local-approved things you must do when in Prague. Here they are.
I strongly recommend checking the lesser-known 10th-century castle of Vysehrad. It offers some great views of the river and the city but also features lovely grounds perfect for picnics and gatherings with friends. Some of…

The Czech capital guards its secrets.
We came late to Prague. By the time we made our way to the red-roofed city, the path to the east was already well-beaten by hordes of budget travelers and lairy British stag parties. An influx of foreign tourists has pushed Prague close to the top of the list of Europe’s most visited cities, with all the opportunities and problems that kind of popularity creates for the local residents.
But Prague is every bit as beautiful as it was back when it seemed so exotic, smiling shyly behind the Iron Curtain. The Haussmannian grandeur of the Old Town buildings invites comparison with Paris, but Parisiens would never allow their buildings to be painted like this. Bright yellow next to powder blue beside terracotta. And while tourists gape at the astronomical clock that jerks into life twenty-four times a day, the sun — when it shines — gilds the dark spires of the Church of Our Lady of Tyn and makes the old stones glow as brightly as the painted buildings.
The same force that makes a person wander the world pushes flowers from the ground to salute the distant sun. The artists of Prague don’t stop painting the old buildings just because they can no longer afford to own them. Among the graffiti of the Old Town, two themes recurred: the Golem, as played by Paul Wegener in the 1920 horror film he directed. And the simple phrase, in English: Life Is Beautiful.
Flowers bloom and die and never leave a mark, and for most of us, this beautiful life is the same.
Few of us shape history, like the dead kings in their cold tombs on the high hill where Prague’s castle stands. But that doesn’t keep us from trying. For an additional fee that’s as steep as the stairs, you can climb the tower of St Vitus Cathedral and look out across the river at Prague. And up there, in the teeth of the wind that rises from the Vltava, you can see the old stones scored with the initials of decades of visitors, the merged letters in a dozen languages forming the ridges and valleys of an insensate fingerprint.
Prague isn’t as cheap as it used to be when the first intrepid tourists arrived from the West after the fall of Communism. But it’s still an absolute steal compared to the likes of Paris or London or Barcelona. Two nights at the gorgeous five star Art Nouveau Palace cost 166 euros after tax. Dinner and drinks for two at a Michelin starred restaurant for 200. Prague still represents a great deal for a budget traveler and offers a chance to splash out on high-end experiences at a price you could never hope to pay in other European capitals.
Prague has other marks, too. Scars with gloomier origins than the vandalizing initials of bright and brutish tourists.
On the day we visited, a young woman was lighting a candle in front of the narrow window of the church basement. The stone is still pockmarked with holes, where Nazi bullets once struck sparks from the walls. Seven hundred and fifty soldiers launched attack after attack on the church, but couldn’t dislodge the men hiding inside.
After hours of fighting, the Germans brought in the fire brigade and ordered them to flood the basement. Not one of the Czech freedom fighters was taken alive. The mission cost them their lives and the lives of anyone connected to them. It also prompted Nazi massacres in villages entirely unconnected with the plot. But it was the only successful assassination of a high-ranking Nazi officer. The war would continue, of course, with or without Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler’s ‘man with an iron heart.’ But at the cost of their lives, Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis, Adolf Opalka, Josef Bublik, Jaroslav Svarc, Josef Valcik, and Jan Hruby proved that despite their military prowess, even the highest-ranking officials of the Nazi government could be killed. And 70 years later, Czechs still honor the bravery of men willing to die for their country.
Some fights are worth having. And life is beautiful. So beautiful that sometimes it’s worth losing.
Prague feels like the kind of place with secrets. It’s still relatively new to modern mass tourism, having been shut off behind the Iron Curtain within my lifetime. You can see it in the bullet marks, or in the creepy statue of the Commendatore outside the theater where Mozart’s Don Giovanni premiered. You can see it in the frowning face of the ubiquitous Golem.
Stories make cities what they are, just as they do for people. We become the sum of what we experience, our cathedrals and our bullet holes. Our spires and basements. We may be the wealthiest and most fortunate group of people in human history, and yet so many of us are afraid. Afraid to lose what we have. Afraid to fail. Afraid of others who are themselves prisoners of fear, that makes them lash out and bite anyone they can reach. Fear lives at the heart of our culture, the magic word written down and stuffed into the hollow clay skull of the Golem to make it live.
Tyranny comes in many forms, and fear has always been one of its favorite weapons. Prisons without bars are the hardest to escape. I’m living proof that you can spend your whole life making what seems like the right decision and never get any closer to what you really want — the raw experience of being alive. Inside each of us, an iron-hearted voice commands caution, and while we hoard worthless tokens and live in fear of losing, we miss the bright imperfect world sailing by.
And yet we all want to make our mark. That brief blaze of light across an immensity of darkness, to say in some way to the uncaring universe that we were here. This is mine, a few words held out into the world like writing on water, vanishing even in the act of creation. The rough wind whirls the ticket from my hand, and I carry on without it, lighter for the loss.

Presented at ICOM Prague. August 24, 2022. Because I don’t ever fully ‘write’ talks but instead assemble slides which I then talk ‘around’, what follows is a very slightly more verbose version. The images used in the presentation, of which some are included here, were generated using the ‘of the moment’ AI image synthesis tools Midjourney and DALL-E2, I have included the relevant prompts used in the image captions. I wanted to use those images as a means of hinting at some of what I didn’t talk about.
Hello. I changed jobs last week and so did my slides.
I’d like to acknowledge that these words were prepared on the unceded lands of the people of the Kulin Nation in Naarm (Melbourne). The ideas I will talk about are the result of working with many collaborators, and inspired by many other poeple. All knowledge is the result of generosity and intercultural exchange.
A huge thank you to ICOM, and the organising team in Prague especially Martina and Jiri. And also to the tech team here at the conference centre who were able to deal with my request to present on my own device from the stage. I know how hard this can be when you’ve not set up your venue to make that possible.
I work at ACMI, Australia’s national museum of screen culture. I will give you a little bit of background because it will help contextualise some of what I say later. Because this is ICOM, let’s begin with our collection.
ACMI has a large collection of different types of objects and media. Our historical time-based media is stored on analogue and magnetic formats but our contemporary commissions arrive as digital files on digital storage formats — hard drives, USB sticks. This used to be rare. It is now common. The range and diversity of our contemporary works continues to expand from linear to interactive, networked, and multiplayer games.
As you may also be aware, Melbourne also has an amazing videogame-making creative community. As a result we also collect modern videogames and because of the uncertainty and complexity in digital preservation, this is a collaborative effort with Powerhouse Museum (Sydney) and National Film and Sound Archive (Canberra). This approach to collecting contemporary software-based artworks is greatly assisted by this distributed collecting approach, which I believe will become necessary and standard practice across many types of museum.
Through this process we’ve learned that digital objects are more fragile than their analogue ‘originals’, and that both digital and digitised objects exist in systems that require reliable power, engineering, maintenance, ongoing software development. These are all challenging frontiers for museums.
Further, collecting modern materials and presenting them for contemporary audiences has forced us to rethink the documentation processes of the past. Our online collection documentation reveals to the public the bias in what has (and has not) been collected, and how the language used in historical documentation practices reflects the prejudices and social biases of its time.
We also make rich experiential exhibitions that take advantage of constantly improving projection and interactive technologies. ACMI is also a bit famous for The Lens. With the support of the Lens, ACMI wants to change the media we make and consume. We want to change the what, the how, and the why of cinema, of television, of games. The Lens is one in a range of technologies to foreground the visitors’ agency in this. And the visitors’ responsibility to ‘take the museum home with them’. We work with the seductiveness of the media forms to sow the seeds of a critical eye, ear and hand.
Things have changed.
The old ACMI used to be a place to come to see an exhibition or watch arthouse cinema. That was how we measured success. The new ACMI suceeds when it changes what you watch or make, and changes how you watch and make. And that change could occur anywhere — hence our brand as a ‘multiplatform museum’. We are still figurng out how to best measure that.
ACMI’s mission and how we fulfil that mission has been transformed by harnessing the potential of new technologies.
As a quick aside, at ICOM, many people have asked me about ‘the metaverse’. Julian Oliver, now a well known contemporary artist (‘critical engineer’) along with Chad Chatterton, and Andrea Blundell — built a real-time collaborative virtual world — ACMIpark — that reproduced ACMI and Federation Square online, and bridged the physical and the virtual.
This was before Second Life, before Facebook.That was twenty years ago.
These ideas that seem new are not new.
The rest of the talk is a gentle provocation.
In 1968, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a conference on ‘computers and museums’. It was very important, and like many things from the late 1960s, we still feel its resonance today. At that conference the University of Illinois presented the PLATO system [Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Applications]. PLATO was originally developed for the Illiac I computer connected to 20 student terminals and was a key part of education technology research. In these images we glimpse the birth of user experience design for media technology in museums.
“The terminal must be simple to use, yet flexible enough to accommodate and display many types of information. It must provide enough depth and scope of information to challenge the visitor without confusing him. It must involve him in gathering information and answering questions without frustrating him.”
You can see on this user diagram the familiar ideas of story, question & answer, user comments, related objects that museum educators and designers still focus on today. These are some of the first terms we still see in design briefs for gallery interactive experiences, and online catalogues.
That was more than fifty years ago.
It was designed in an era before the arrival of colour television.
We still think like that today.
In 1994 I was at university. Both I and many others were excited by the arrival of the nascent public web. For those of us in Australia and NZ, the 1990s and early 2000s ignited a utopian dream of ‘planetary computation’ and access to a ‘global network’. Culturally too — for us, distant and far awy — it offered the mirage of an opportunity to destabilise the media power centres of Europe and North America.
The web could have gone in many directions. There was the cosmopolitan web, the web as an infinite library, the web as a playground. And of course the web as a shopping mall.
Museum websites were rare but the first that existed were courageous. Some museums collaborated with others to build ‘knowledge portals’ and in some countries, museums even provided internet access directly to communities that they worked with. Even though screen resolutions were tiny, museums were worried about the people ‘stealing our thumbnail images’.
It was a short lived dream.
Back then it felt like digital technology promised a lot. We thought expansively about the opportunities and that early history of museums and the web is largely one of exploration and imagination.
Unfortunately we didn’t question the underlying logic or politics of the databases we were working with or building. That would come much later.
Nowadays, every museum has a website. Even the smallest. And they ‘do social media’ even if its a job done by a volunteer. They don’t even need to do it well. Their web presence is just a communication of ‘we exist’ — like a sign on a motorway that cars zoom past barely noticing.
In 2008 the smartphone and mobile devices grew web access by billions of people. Suddenly half of the planet was connected — we did not think of the consequences of such rapid change. More people, all at once, was great for the profits of technology companies, but not for much else. The debates around access to the internet changed to focus on the quality of that access.
The internet is now awash with digital content and museums flood the web with their digitised collections. As a result of the economics of web platforms, everything is tracked. In an attention economy, breadth wins over depth. More, more and more.
We have seen that flood of content change our politics, grow misinformation, grow fear, destabilise our societies. In the absence of shared narratives, communities will create their own narratives — true, false, rumour or otherwise.
The companies that emerged as part of the Web 2.0 wave have merged and consolidated into a handful of closed, data leveraged platforms. Free-to-use platforms have monetised our attention, monetised our data.
It turns out that the Internet is not a place.
We need to stop thinking about it using metaphors of place. There is no ‘there’ there.
The cloud is simply a server farm in a region of cheap real estate with manageable weather and reliable energy supply. Like ACMI’s digital collections it is fragile. More fragile than we think. During the recent UK heatwave, several of the server farms underpinning the UK cloud came under extreme heat stress impacting the performance of major digital platforms. We should expect this to worsen — and more of the Global North will be exposed to the conditions that the Global South has existed as an everyday reality.
The internet is not a place. It is better thought of as a time machine, or a time sink.
So now what?
Through the pandemic I’ve been running a mentoring scheme for arts and culture CEOs pairing them with digital practitioners. In this program we work through conceptual and strategic issues around technology and how it affects and creates opportunities across different artforms and practices. It aims at building competencies amongst senior arts leaders to help them navigate the potential of the future — developing a both capabilites and critically, fostering a digital imagination.
It has not just been for museums but also for ‘adjacent’ arts institutions — theatre, music, dance, cultural centres, performance venues. Through it, we have realised that we share many of the same challenges — ageing infrastructure conceived of in the last decade of the 20th century; skills that are expensive and rare; and as a result of infrastructural and skills shortages, we have crimped our imaginations. We talk a lot about risk, and we talk about cybersecurity, machine learning, bias, we talk about accessibility and we talk about sharing services across domains.
At the heart of this is the question, what might institutions need to support the creative practices of the future — for the more diverse audiences of the future?
Our conversations have shifted from digital marketing, the latest immersive spectacle, and back of house operations to tangible transformation —21st century infrastructure, staff skills and an expanded creative imagination. And how that shift inevitably leads to new questions about institutional purpose.
How might our buildings adapt and be re-designed for an always-connected visitor? And even more importantly, how might we retain that visitor’s attention and focus whilst they are in our building?
How might we shift our focus from technologies of ‘information and data’, to those of world-building, narrative, emotion and imagination?
How might we better collaborate across the arts and cultural sector?
But, and there is always a but.
The pandemic and its social effects has created a huge demand for quick ‘solutions’. Around the globe many institutions are in desperate situations — lacking revenue, lacking State support, pressured by the demands of a rapidly changing social and cultural context.
This situation sets up a risky situation where museums and those in a desperate situtation are easy marks for questionable ‘solutions’. Just as museums are not neutral, neither are technologies. All technologies have a politics and all media technologies have a specific grain. Museums will be ineffective if we do not understand the nuance of that grain.
Networked digital technologies are not inherently democratic.
New web technologies are easily branded with the language and rhetoric of liberation. We have seen this recently in the rhetoric around so-called Web3. This language often hides extractive and anti-democratic intent.
Beware the term ‘decentralization’ in this context.
In the technology discourse around Web3, ‘decentralization’ can be a legitimate desire to unseat the powerful platforms that control much of the web as we experience it today.
But when coupled with ‘blockchain’ it is also easily co-opted into a series of ideologies that work against many of the ethics and purpose of our institutions. In this context ‘decentralization’ undermines the very idea of institutions and in some cases, sees societies only a mass of individuals distrustful of each other, mediated by so-called ‘smart contracts’. In this context, ‘decentralization’ can be code for unfettered libertiarian anarcho-capitalism.
Museums beware.
Beware, too, if you do not understand how the companies you work with expect to generate profit for their investors and shareholders. In modern technology industries, funded by venture capital, the way in which revenue is generated is often very opaque.
And remember the words of Kate Crawford and Vladen Joler in 2018, writing on the technologies behind the Amazon Echo, but applicable to contemporary digital services generally,
“each small moment of convenience — be it answering a question, turning on a light, or playing a song — requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data”
With that in mind, we need to be clear about what change we want our museums to make in our communities before we can appropriately choose the technologies that will help us realise this.
What does your museum actually want technology to do for it? Is it more than “greater efficiency”, more than “new revenue opportunities”, more than “reaching younger audiences”?
Looking back to that conference of 1968 and its prescient but unacheived ideas, how might your museum imagine possibilities that were actually unimaginable half a century ago?
Who do you partner with to achieve this ethically, sustainably, and in the least extractive manner possible?
You need to be able to confidently answer these questions in a manner that speaks to your institution’s mission and purpose because every museum technologist with any experience will tell you“… technology is expensive, difficult, needs a lot of maintenance, it will break, it will become obsolete, and your vendor will disappear”.
They are right.
Thank you to ICOM, the ICOM conference committee in Prague, Martina Lehmannová, Jiří Stýblo, and everyone who has been so welcoming on this trip.

August 28, 2012.
I had just finished my dietetic internship in NYC at the hospital formerly known as Beth Israel Medical Center, now transitioned to Mount Sinai, and I felt a sense of freedom. Where better to reap the benefits of this long-lost feeling than wander around Eastern Europe, specifically Bohemia, specifically Prague?
I hopped on an ICE fast train from Leipzig, Germany to Prague. Back then I had no smartphone, and I used a paper map to guide my way through the winding European streets. I got around just fine, except for that one time I was lost in the rain at 2 am. I did eventually find my way back to the Hotel Sunflower.
One thing I pack with me while traveling is a notebook and pen to write down thoughts, ideas, things I would like to do and see; places to eat and drink. My weekend in Bohemia included a typical tourist visit to Prague Castle and the Staropramen Brewery, yet it also included some not-for-tourist places such as Tynska Bar & Books, and this other place I had read about that was known for its vegetarian food in the land of pork knuckle and dumplings. The Czech name of the restaurant is Lehka Hlava, which translates to Clear Head.
Perfect, I thought. The name called to me after my long-lost night. I needed to clear my head.
After I arrived and was taken to my table at the restaurant I noticed a table of four women near my table of one. They were laughing, and enjoying their food and wine. Seeing them made me miss my friends back home. I bounced back into the present and ordered a full meal complete with a starter, a main, and a dessert with one glass of wine.
Looking back all these years later I cannot remember exactly what I ordered, but I do remember that the meal I had that evening in Prague was the best meal I had while traveling Bohemia. I remember the bill was equivalent to about 12 US dollars, which has been embedded into my memory since I was a graduate student at NYU at the time— not rich in money, but rich in books.
Although I cannot recall exactly what I chose on the menu nor did I take any photos of it, I do know that my solo dining experience was welcomed, and the food was honestly delicious.
Now many years later I glance at the menu on my computer. It includes items such as pumpkin and ginger soup with orange juice, vegetable consommé with yeast dumplings, spaghetti with tempeh bacon and sauce of baked garlic, gértaix — cheese balls with cumin sticks, wasabi dressing, and balsamic reduction, Kimchi-potato pancake — traditional Czech potato pancake with kimchi and spring onion, and hot raspberry crumble with mascarpone-ricotta cream.
The menu reflects the diversity of the chefs at Lehka Hlava, and each dish has a goal to both electrify and soothe the senses. I still think about this restaurant now and then. It pops into my mind as “those carefree days.” It was such a relaxing atmosphere and left me with a sense of, well, clarity. I left Prague happy and with lucidity. I did not get lost that night with my paper map.

“I don’t have a girlfriend, but I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that.”
-Mitch
I decided on Prague next because Kevin had told me you can get wasted there for 5 bucks. That was enough for me. Kevin always knows the right move. Except for the time he jumped into the Chicago River, drunk as hell, to rescue a shoe. That was dumb. The Czech Republic had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
The only issue with Prague was the overnight, 14-hour train ride I needed to take to get there. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to go. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost the equivalent of 4 Euros/night (about $6 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be 3 hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is some deceptive bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand am/pm clocks?
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were torched. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was just me and a few other people who also couldn’t tell time.

April 4, 2006
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple mini baguettes and a bunch of bananas to supplement. I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, lying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling and nodding. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
I put my index finger up, the international sign for “wait a minute,” and went to the bar car to grab four cups. I took some Adderall too, knowing that it was no longer going to be a Tylenol PM type of night. Drugs allow you to execute hairpin turns like an F1 driver.
Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they stood and received their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all good and drunk, telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; four guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dad thoughts.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train and ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like city; the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of walking and smoking, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel.” They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was. Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. I wanted to thank them to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me in what I assumed was Czech for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics. Only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad. When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Nevercomment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in the middle of the night. It’s best to just listen.

When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. It looked like the Catacombs, minus the bones. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon because it was my grandfather’s name, and because I’ve never known a sane Simon. When I was a kid, I went to camp with a Simon who got expelled for torturing animals. And then there was the Simon I knew in Iowa whose party trick was chewing glass and swallowing it. Tons of deviant Simons are roaming the earth unchecked, and it worries me.
Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday.” (The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX). She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was more of a single-cheek, shy smirk, than an all-out smile. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows, and was dressed casually, in blue jeans and a V-neck sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I can usually spot a fellow speed freak, so I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a stumble until the bars opened so he could extend his bender another day.
*
April 5, 2006
When I came down to the common area the next morning, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. Again, I’m looking at you, London. I was impressed the way she carried herself in the kitchen, and by her motherly sensibilities. She took on the role of “hostel mom” naturally, making sure everyone had a homemade meal before embarking on the day. That really attracted me. (Freud would have another field day with me liking mom-types).
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. It’s so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class Americans wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happen in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were dating.
*
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: We are, Johnny… I’m the umpire so I have final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick.
“Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular in its’ simplicity. It reminded me of a hotel conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer.
When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We pulled up seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked the beers over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on out we were old friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid onto the table. I knew moonshine when I saw it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could see straight. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others cackled. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech music and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling. Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching like Dave used to. Every time we got close, he’d scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: (sarcastically) Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar, where we drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: Running from my feelings? Trying to become my own man? I’m not totally sure anymore. Since my dad died last year, I just can’t stop speeding, that’s all I know.
Caroline: I understand.
Me: Do you?
Caroline: My younger brother died in a car crash last year.
Me: So, you’re doing the same thing?
Caroline: Yeah. I keep telling myself that running away from something means you’re running towards something else, but lately it hasn’t been working. So, I came here to forget myself altogether.
Me: How’s that working?
Caroline: It’s not really. Grief is just a cunt.
Me: Same and same.
Caroline: How about we run together and if that makes it any better?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I hear Bratislava is nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t watch it between now and tomorrow.

From time to time, I try to improve my Lightroom catalog’s structure to better organize my photos — and while going through my Prague photos, I started noticing patterns in the places I shoot. Sometimes, I go to certain areas on purpose because I know they’re great for photos (or I just want to explore something unfamiliar). Other times, I’m just wandering around without a plan and somehow end up at these familiar places. I realized there are certain locations where I feel more comfortable shooting and where I consistently come home with photos I’m proud of.
Also, I’ve recently received multiple questions on Glass about the best street photography spots in Prague. So, after having lived in Prague and walked its streets for almost two years now (often with a camera in my bag or in my hand), I thought it might be helpful to write about some of these recommended spots.
If you’re visiting Prague, or even if you live here and are looking for good places for street photography, these might be useful for you too.
Let’s start with one of my favorites, a place that always seems to offer something new: the area around the National Theatre (aka Národní divadlo).
The National Theatre is an impressive building with its grand, neo-classical design right on the banks of the river Vltava. What makes this spot truly stand out, though, is the building behind it: the New Stage (Nová scéna), or as the locals call it, “The Ice Cube”. The New Stage couldn’t be more different — it’s modernist (brutalist, to be exact), boxy, and covered in textured glass panels that bounce the light, sometimes in unexpected ways. The contrast between these two buildings, side by side, makes for some great photos, especially if you like playing with old vs. new themes.
But to be a bit cliché here, the buildings are just half of the story. The real magic happens in the life around them. The narrow tram stop in front, with its old red Tatra T3s, is always busy (but not chaotic) with people lined up in a single row, waiting, boarding, or rushing to catch their ride. The open space around the theatre adds a sense of scale, while the narrow passages create more intimate scenes, perfect for experimenting with different compositions, perspectives, and leading lines.
The best time for shooting here is probably a sunny afternoon when the light creates deep shadows and bounces off the glass of the New Stage. This can add depth and contrast to the photos and highlight the theatre’s detailed, brown facade with a warm feel. This effect can be harder to catch in winter when the sun doesn’t rise high enough to be above the buildings. But I’ve also been here on dark, rainy days, and the scene was equally interesting.
I won’t lie — sometimes I feel like I might end up with the same shot over and over if I keep going back. But more often than not (and it surprises me!), that isn’t the case. I’ve tried to figure out what keeps me coming back, and my best answer so far is the mix of the expected and unexpected. One day, you’ll find people going about their usual routines; the next, there might be a street performer, skaters, or a temporary exhibition in the middle of the “inner square.” The stage stays the same, but the act changes. I know, this might sound like a cliché again — what else would you expect in the center of a capital city? — but I’ve found most other areas of Prague more predictable. This balance of routine and surprise, old and new, makes the surroundings of Národní Divadlo an almost endless source of inspiration. At least for me, and at least for now.
Oh, and I’ve found myself growing more fond of these brutalist buildings. And Prague certainly has a few of them. Maybe that’s part of the reason, who knows!
I think the area around the National Theatre is like a small version of what makes Prague so special from a street photography perspective. It’s got history, modern architecture, and plenty of street life. If you’re looking for a spot that will spark new ideas for street photography, this is a good place to start — maybe even the best.
Thanks for reading to the end! If you enjoyed this or have any thoughts, I’d appreciate your 👏 claps and comments — especially if you’ve already taken photos here or are planning to visit Prague with a camera.
Small note:During my preparation, I came across an article mentioning that the Ice Cube will undergo renovations starting next summer, which are expected to last for several years. So, you might want to hurry up and visit before it starts!

Which part of Himachal are you from?I am actually not from Himachal, but from Madhya Pradesh.But you’re a Thakur?Yes, MP as well has Thakurs.
This is how my first interaction with most people at Himachal Pradesh (the northern state that hosts my workplace IIT Mandi) begins, people with last name Thakur being omnipresent here. However, perhaps the most famous Thakur was from West Bengal (a state in the East of India), and interestingly, he is known more commonly as a Tagore in India. At Prague — the city of hundred spires — though, my stay was booked at Thakurova — the Thakur street — and so I knew I would be welcome at Czechia.
My trip to Boston (recall Tryst with America?) had made me acquaintance with Prof. Jan Vitek’s group at Northeastern University. I met him again during ECOOP 2019 (recall Romance at London?) — we knew we were working in similar areas — so he suggested I visit his laboratory at Czech Technical University, where I would hopefully be able to formalize a working relationship. And thus the seed to a trip to Prague — one of my most memorable trips ever — was sown.
In general I would have been worried about the cold weather at Prague in January. However, having settled after the London trip at Mandi, in one of the coldest states of India, I wasn’t much excited (read worried) about the weather. This, however, also translated to not being prepared for the trip at all. My first teaching semester at IIT Mandi ended in December, and it was only after that, that I started planning a trip — my longest abroad till date — to Prague in January. Two things I was more thoughtful about, though, were (i) The Visa; and (ii) The Trip to Delhi — you will get to know a very suspenseful story about both in Rendezvous with Athena. TLDR: The Visa was smooth, I travelled to Delhi a day before this time, and hence obtained a comfortable flight hopping for an hour at Sharjah (the place I knew from childhood for Cricket matches).
Prague is known to be a beautiful city, and a very welcoming one for tourists. I was supposed to stay 12 nights at a hostel-cum-hotel (wrongly known as a dorm) named Masaryk Colej. The second word indicates its association with the college CVUT (Czech Technical University, in English). Travel from the airport was quite comfortable: you buy an hourly ticket for public travel in Prague and can then take any bus, tram, or metro — very convenient for those who don’t understand the currency or the local addresses. So I took a bus and a tram (Pristi zastavka) and reached the hotel. First surprise: I was provided with a map to find my room! And indeed, the map was damn useful — you need to pass through a cobweb of rooms (smelling the varieties of food college guys keep cooking in there) to finally reach the corridor that forms the “hotel” part of the huge building. I needed the map on quite a few occasions (specially when I decided to wander around the building trying to get a glimpse of the food).
I used to walk daily to the university, take the lift to the 13th floor (tried the stairs one day!), and come back in the evening. Pretty standard. So what I would do next, is to mainly discuss the interesting trips — solo as well as group — along with the classical places I visited, the people I met, and the heart-warming experiences that I got in the extremely cold weather (subzero on almost all days). Not to forget the funny stories surrounding the food!
This was the first time I was visiting a place that’s famous for its exotic food — but almost all non-veg. The first day I located a Pizza outlet with vegetarian options, about 1.5 miles from my hotel. I had taken my warmest clothes, but God it was really difficult following Google Map as you need to take your gloves off (I got enlightened about touchscreen-enabled gloves much later). Being in Europe I knew I didn’t have to worry much about tips and the phrases for taking home versus dining-in as in the US (Europe and India have pretty much similar terminologies, owing to history). Breakfasts were taken care of by the hotel (with two kinds of cupcakes, orange juice, toast, and cheese forming the 365-day menu). Lunches (and some dinner outings on weekdays): I knew I would have enough expertise from the lab in sailing through the university canteen. However, things became adventurous when I decided to try the hotel restaurant for a dinner:
Me: “Which all options in the menu are vegetarian?”She: [After the previous sentence being looped over 20 times]: “Yes, please sit; we will bring you vegetarian.”
On table I get something that looks very muttonish. After making some noise the chef came out of the kitchen; he understood some English and told I could get a replacement without paying again.
Me: “Which dish will you get for me?”He: “Vegetarian.”
Finally I got some cauliflower (in its purest vegetarian, read raw, form) and some fried (read oil-soaked) potatoes. I ate about 30% from my plate, then boiled MTR Poha (puffed rice) carried from home in the hot water obtained from the geyser-that-actually-worked-only-in-the-morning, and knew this was the end of trying out my luck at the hotel (apart from breakfast). On the remaining days I mostly sticked to the long menu of a Chinese restaurant next door (147 dishes, 3 vegetarian), an occasional Pizza from the chilly-walk place, and my MTR Pohas cooked with the morning-only geyser.
However, one night we had a fine dinner at an Indian restaurant (where I again found that Indians have a much stronger digestive system, think spices); I tried some tasty soups with two new friends on a beautiful evening; and on the last day finally tried the national dish (which happens to be vegetarian) — Fried cheese:
As indicated before, Prague is perhaps the city with the most convenient public transport: You can just install an app and charge it with your card for a day (not expensive at all), get a barcode that is your ticket, and travel as you want in any tram, bus, metro, or train. Moreover, the city is very-well covered — you perhaps don’t need to walk more than a few hundred meters anywhere — you will have nicely maintained, well-timed, clean-and-safe public transport available at the blink of an eye. I had listed down a large number of places to visit, and divided them into two days: Day 1 and Day 2, for the Saturday and the Sunday.
If you followed me in America, you know that the first thing on my list in a city that has a zoo, has to be a zoo. So Saturday began with visiting one of the best places hosting animals in the world: The Prague Zoo. Unlike the Zoo at Washington DC, at Prague you are welcomed with the star cast quite near to the entrance:
I spent nearly 3 hours at the zoo, walking about 8 kilometers inside, and ended with a team of as-tall-as-can-get Giraffes, and as-cute-as-can-get Penguins:
The next stop was The Old Town across Charles bridge (challenge: find the river in the lab-view above). Old Town has several attractions from the times Czechia was part of the Soviet Union, with several churches and castles at every turn. While the Prague Castle reminds one of Hogwarts, the Astronomical Clock attracts a huge crowd every hour for witnessing one of the many scientific marvels associated with the same (read more on Wikipedia):
Charles Bridge is a heritage on its own, with so many activities and picture-spots around that you can spend hours walking across and yet find something every time you cross! A beautiful view of the colorful city follows:
I finished traversing the Old Town by filling my bag at a shop full of candies (and forgetting the bag mid-way during my return journey)!
Having explored the crowded places the previous day, I decided to spend a solo Sunday climbing hills and exploring castles — both being rare opportunities in a vibrant city. The day was cold and hazy, but I walked and walked like crazy.
Vysehrad is an old castle in a bit far-off location, and should be traveled in broad day-light, is what I was told. Though the far-off part was true, I found the place full of people craving for silent time amidst the hustle and bustle of the cheerful city. You could sit there for hours with a book in hand, appreciating the rare greenery in the coldest of months.
The last I went was The Petrin Hill — reminiscent of the hikes I do around Mandi. I went up via a crowded rope-way and came down exploring solitary paths watching the city of hundred spires; as you descend, you realize every climb has its end, but the walk downhill doesn’t necessarily take you down.
If you ever visit Prague, do roam around the colorful streets, but take a moment walking up/down the Petrin Hill, sitting on that bench I couldn’t, and wondering “what to eat next” :-)
I returned back via Warsaw; the trip was prepended with a day’s stay with an about-to-be-engaged friend at New Delhi, and appended with a trip to Kolkata — a city where you drive ahead with both the legs on breaks (for preserving its classical past) — to attend the engagement of the same (more about my old-and-gold friends some time later!).
The series had promised an article every few weeks: it started swiftly, but has been going on rather slow. For me, the year 2020 has been full of remembering (read missing) the travels from 2019, and avid readers are in for many more write-ups. For now, an assurance is to have a few more articles than those promised in the intro A Traveling Year, one of them being exclusively on the rather long airport stays and flight journeys (of course with feedback on the food) I have had in the travel-rich year! So keep reading, and stay on…

I’m leaving the hotel bright and early and as I’m about to pack up I detected the quintessential bible that ever hotel ought to have (not!!!), only that here they had a rather unusual version of it.
I then stopped at a local bakery where I had the weakest coffee ever. I think I just don’t know how to (or rather what to) order. This actually begs the question: How much of a language is it courtesy to learn when visiting a country where one doesn’t speak the language? I understand zero Czech and here in the countryside the folks don’t tend to speak English. Maybe I should’ve tried German? After all, the city of Litoměřice — where I spent the night — was once part of the “Province of German Bohemia” and the town actually still has a German name: Leitmeritz. Well, I didn’t end up learning any Czech here at this bakery and instead made myself understandable with pointing at various items in the display case.
After breakfast, I hit the road. As I was passing the train station I saw a cool structure: a bike tower. I guess it’s for the folks commuting by train to work? This part of the country is certainly set up for cycling, with the Elbe-Labe Cycling Path probably contributing considerably to the local community. Later, I saw another cycle-friendly piece of infrastructure: a solar-powered charging station for e-bike.
Today’s first section of the route continued taking me along the river Elbe. As it was still rather early in the day, I saw a lot of fisherman sitting by the river and waiting for fish to latch on. There were so many of them and all of them men. I was wondering: How come women don’t do fishing? Seems like a relaxing activity. Maybe because they need to do the housework and tend to the kids while the men are frolicking their hobby?
On a similarly gender-related note, I noticed the below cycling path signs. Maybe someone would like to write a thesis on stereotypes in (modern) street signage? Questions that come to mind: Who still wears a hat like this? Do men really have the time to walk their daughters to school? Aren’t they too busy fishing? Discuss.
What I noticed since entering Czechia is that the Elbe here has several dams and so instead of a river, it often looks more like a lake. At one point today, I crossed one of these dams/locks and there were quite a few things to see.
Just like yesterday, I had the option to do a shortcut and arrive in Prague much faster: As rivers tend to meander, you can choose to go a straighter route. I decided to not be straight and instead follow the river path, which added a good 30km. I did this, because one of the highlights along the route was the river mouth where the Vltava (Moldau) and merges into the Labe (Elbe).
By the time I hit Mělník, I have to admit that I was starting to get tired. The next opportunity for food was not for another 25km and I was getting hungry. I stopped at a little convenience store to buy some fruits and water and that tied me over. The wind picked up and at some point I was cycling underneath a big dark cloud, which at eventually unloaded in a swift shower. I quickly found shelter underneath a tree, with view of a lovely castle.
Eventually, I arrived in an industrial-looking town and at the big roundabout I had a fundamental decision to make: Where should I buy my lunch from? The Lidl or the Tesco? Or, in other words: Supporting a German or British corporation? You can ask me next time you see me, which team I voted for. In any case, my fancy lunch consisted of two slices of pepperoni pizza and a sweet roll…all eaten at the back of the large supermarket building next to some vagabonds.
Then came the exciting part of the day and it literally elevated my heart rate: at some point my bike app showed me to cut through some forest area instead of following the river. Upon investigation, I saw that the stretch along the river was deemed “dangerous” by some cyclists. But the reckless person I am, I decided to choose the perilous option. Well, let’s just say this: I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, unless you have a mountain bike and like the thrill of cycling dangerously close to a cliff. To calm my nerves, I was humming the melody of Smetana’s Die Moldau, which was only fitting as I was cycling along its shores…
Since I’d sweated so much during this last stretch and since my destination for the day was in relatively close proximity, I decided to sit down at one of the very popular riverside kiosks for a glass of refreshing beer. What a great decision!
Eventually I arrived at the campsite and luckily they still had a space for me. The campground is just outside Prague city center and conveniently located next to a tram stop. After I’d set up camp, I took said mode of transport instead of my bike and ventured into the city.
Honestly, I was quite knackered and knew it wouldn’t be a night of partying. But, I wanted to enjoy a good meal and so I consulted Yelp and followed the recommendations for a restaurant called Vinohradský Parlament. It’s a beautiful restaurant and the waiter was fantastic. He recommended a hearty meal for me as I was telling him that I’d just cycled 100km and was rather famished. Their specialty are Czech dumplings (knedlíky) and this pillowy soft delicacy was perfect to soak up the juices that came with my beef roulade. For dessert, I had another kind of dumpling: this one stuffed with fresh blueberries! Yummy!
Afterwards, I was so tired that — after a brief wander around the city — I got back on the tram to my tent.

Since arriving in Eastern Europe, I’ve never experienced cloudy weather until now. At 7 in the morning, I dragged my tired body out for breakfast. Our accommodation offers an outdoor terrace, allowing us to enjoy the warm sunshine while savoring bread and morning orange juice.
It seems that Czech is as famous for its apples as it is for its dark beer. Everywhere we went, apples were being sold, and there were many bread and dishes containing apples. Although I didn’t crave any special taste, thinking about my growling stomach as I walked, I grabbed an apple and hurriedly set off for Prague again today.
Havel Market & Trdelník
We went straight to the traditional market in Prague that we had been eager to visit, Havel Market. Unfortunately, there were a few things that left us slightly disappointed:

Prague seemed like the wisest choice for my next destination, given they were still on the Koruna (information I acquired from the ladies in Paris). They had yet to switch over to the Euro, and as a result, the exchange rate with the dollar was about 4:1. In simple terms, everything in Prague was cheap compared to other European Union countries. Slovakia was also on the Koruna, but that will come later.
I didn’t know much about Prague, other than that my friend, Kevin, told me I needed to go because “you can get wasted there for 5 bucks.” That was enough for me. Kevin always knows what he’s talking about. The only problem was the overnight, 14-hour train ride. But that’s what Tylenol PM is for, or Ambien if you have access. I figured I’d just zonk out then arrive in the daytime, rested and ready to romp. So, I booked a bed in a 4-person room for the 20:00 train that night.
I had a while to kill yet, so I did my laundry and went to an internet café to peruse hostels. I found one called, “Hostel One Prague,” and booked it as soon as I saw pictures of a bar. Again, the stumble home just can’t be beat. It cost 8 Euros/night (about $10 USD at the time) and looked just weird enough for my taste. I was stoked.
When I got back to the train station at 7pm, I sat down in the corner of the massive waiting area to kill time, for what I thought would be two and a half hours.
Let me stop for a second and say military time is bullshit. Why is it even used at all? Do soldiers not understand clocks? What the fuck are we doing here? Come on.
Anyway, I missed my train.
20:00 looks and feels like 10:00pm, I will die on that hill. Tell me I’m wrong. It’s an optical illusion.
The following train didn’t depart until eleven hundred hours the next morning (see how stupid that is?) and going back to either the hotel or the hostel was not an option. Those bridges were burned and shit on. So, I slept in the train station cuddling my backpack. It was me and a few other people, who I assume also couldn’t tell time.
When I woke up the next morning, I had breakfast before hitting the train station booze shop. I bought whiskey and wine for the ride, and for when I‘d arrive in Prague in the middle of the night. Never show up to a party empty handed. I also got a couple more baguettes and a bunch of bananas (I didn’t want to take the chance of separating them), to supplement the Adderall I was going to take once the ride began. There’s nothing like Adderall when you need to kill 14 hours. Shit, you could stare at a clock for the entire time and still enjoy it. At least that’s how the drug made me feel.
The cabin was tinier than I expected, and my three roommates were already there, laying on their beds. The four of us tried to introduce ourselves, but we quickly realized none of us spoke the same language. One guy spoke Cantonese, one French, and the other, German. Names were even difficult, as they all involved different dialects. Communicating verbally was an impossibility. I feared the four of us were in for a silent ride.
After a short while, I pulled out a bottle of wine from my bag and opened it with a corkscrew, making a loud popping sound. Before taking a swig, I looked around the room to get everyone’s attention, but they were already looking in my direction, smiling. I motioned to the bottle and asked, “eh?”. We all broke out in laughter.
“I’ll be right back,” I told them.
I went to the bar cart and asked for four cups. Back in the cabin, I handed one to each guy before getting in my bed. One at a time, they receive their serving, like communion. After our first round, the bottle was finished, so I pulled out another. Then came the whiskey. Within two hours we were all loose as geese. We took turns telling stories in our own language without caring if we were understood by the others. The person standing had the floor, and the full attention of the other three. Miming (they love mimes in France, and we were still technically within the border), and facial expressions were all we needed. Words, as usual, were unnecessary.
When my turn came around, I regaled the guys of my time in Paris, acting out my shitting and vomiting fiasco from a few days prior. They were hysterical. We all were. It was beautiful; 4 guys from all over the world, getting on like lifelong friends, without even the benefit of language. I couldn’t have been more grateful for such a warm experience on a ride that otherwise would have been a lonely one, filled with dark thoughts. Anything to avoid thinking about my dad.
The guys and I all had transfers to make, so we parted ways one at a time, hugging each other and exchanging emails as we said goodbye. I was the last to transfer, and when I did, around 1am, I got on the wrong train. Or maybe it was the second transfer I screwed up; I can’t remember. Either way, I ended up in the middle of nowhere, at the Praha-Veleslavín station at 2:00am. It didn’t even look like I was in Prague, the area was so desolate. I had absolutely no clue where I was, or where to go from there.
After 10 minutes of smoking and walking around, I saw a couple driving down the street, approaching the stop sign where I was standing. I flagged them down, waving my arms like a lunatic. They stopped, as if they’d had this experience before. Unfortunately, they didn’t speak English. With miming now out of the question, all I could do was show them my map, and say the word “hostel”. They nodded their heads and waved me into the car. If they weren’t so old I wouldn’t have gotten in. Have you ever seen an old serial killer? No, obviously not. As soon as they tried to snatch you, you could just rip their frail arms right off. It would be that easy. Now that we’re on the topic, I wonder how old the oldest serial killer was? Can’t be older than 50, right? I mean, it’s a young man’s game, all that trudgery.
After 10 minutes of driving, we stopped in a parking lot with a bunch of taxis in it and the couple motioned for me to get out. I thanked them by leaning forward and grabbing their shoulders. I for sure could have ripped their arms off. Without their kindness, I would have had to spend another night on a train station floor. I wanted to thank them, to show my appreciation, I just didn’t know how. To cover all my bases, I bowed, crossed my heart, blew them kisses, and curtsied. They laughed and went on their way. I still wonder what they were doing out so late. Or maybe it was the morning for them, and they were going to the Czech equivalent of a Denny’s. Old people keep weird hours.
The cabbie spoke to me, in what I assumed was Czech, for the entire 15-minute ride. He knew I had no clue what he was saying, but I think that’s what emboldened him. He was angry about something, probably politics (only politics, or maybe a spouse, can get a person that mad). When he’d look back in the rear-view mirror, I’d shake my head up and down in agreement like, “totally. I can’t believe that either. Those motherfuckers.” Never comment on someone’s politics, especially when they’re driving you around in a foreign country at two in the morning. It’s best to just listen and agree, then form your opinions later.
When I checked in, the manager told me people were still drinking in the “Cave Bar” downstairs. It was an actual cave with stone walls and an echo, very cool. If people were drinking that late, I knew I was in the right place.
The first person to introduce himself was an Irish lad named Simon.
I’ve always hated the name Simon. It was my grandfather’s name, and he was a miserable, racist old bastard. One time he told me he didn’t want my Indian friend, Naveen, over at the house because he, “wreaked of curry.” I used to pray for him to die. And when he did, I helped myself to his collection of Member’s Only jackets.
Irish Simon was all of 5'7'’, 190 lbs., most of which was stored in his robust belly. He had on a punk-style outfit with a mohawk and piercings. He was in his late thirties but came off like a disgruntled teen. His manic energy was off-putting, but he did have a charm to him.
Simon: “How the fuck are ya, ya cunt? I’m Simon. You need a drink.”
Me: Jesus, man, nice to meet you too. I’m Sam.
Simon: I’m going to call you John McEnroe.
Me: Because I look like John McEnroe?
Simon: Because I said so.
Caroline: Ok, Simon. Let’s be nice.
Caroline was there from Australia, on “holiday”. The Australian government partially pays for their post-uni holidays, an act so anti-American it’s hard for me to even conceive. In America we don’t go on “holiday” to explore other cultures, we “vacation” in apocalyptic places like Galveston, TX.
She was 24 years old but seemed older because of how confident and worldly she was. Her smile was beautiful, but she didn’t flash it often. She had long brown hair and bangs that laid atop her eyebrows. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater. Some may have seen her as overweight, but I didn’t. I thought she was pretty. She also had Simon wrapped around her finger, which was impressive. The moment he’d say something too crass she’d tell him to shut up, and he’d listen. He’d even apologize, which amazed me.
Simon: Sorry for calling Sam a cunt. He’s not a cunt. Happy, Caroline?
Simon was just there fucking off, avoiding his life in Dublin. I remember him mentioning a kid, but I didn’t ask any questions because I feared his answers. He and Caroline had just met the day prior, though it seemed like they went way back. The cave had a way of doing that. We drank beers and took shots until the remainder of the Jameson bottle I had was gone. I gave Simon a few Adderall to christen our new friendship. I can always spot a fellow speed freak. He swallowed them right away, against my advice.
Me: If you take them tonight, you won’t be able to sleep.
Simon: I know how speed works, ya fuck.
Caroline and I called it a night around 4:30 am, while Simon went for a walk until the bars opened. For better or worse, I was now a part of a crew.
I slept like a drunken baby until noon the next day. When I came down to the common area, breakfast had already been made, by Caroline. It was a simple spread of toast, eggs, sausage, and potatoes, but I could tell she knew how to cook. Turning raw potatoes into crispy ones without the use of a fryer is not easy. You need to remove some of the starch by first soaking or blanching them. She used the latter method and nailed it. I was impressed, even turned on. She was motherly as well, a quality that inherently attracts me. I appreciated the way she made sure everyone was fed, before eating herself. She was, for all intents and purposes, the Hostel mom. All hostels had one, but like in life, many of them stink.
After breakfast, Caroline and I went on a walk to a nearby bookstore. The place was gigantic and had a line a block long.
Me: There must be a book signing.
Caroline: No, there’s a line because they only let a small amount of people in at a time. Its so shoppers feel comfortable.
Me: Do you know what Black Friday is?
Caroline: No, but it sounds scary.
Me: It is. It’s the day of the year when middle class American people wake up at 4:00am to fist fight over who gets to buy toys.
Caroline: How is this legal?
Me: It’s part of the fabric of our nation.
Inside the bookstore, we had the whole two floor almost all to ourselves. It felt like we were on one of those dates that only happens in movies, where a guy rents out a whole ice rink for a romantic skate. At one point, when she grabbed my hand and pulled me to her favorite section, I could have sworn we were on a date.
When we got back to the Hostel, Simon was in the cave, drinking by himself, so we joined him.
Simon: How was the li-bary, ya fucks?
Me: (mockingly) I rented a good book. It’s called “Wanking Guys Off in Alleys for Dummies,” by Simon’s mom.
Simon: Now that’s the Johnny Mac I like.
Me: We’re still doing this?
Caroline: Johnny… The umpire has the final say. You play tennis, you should know this.
Me: Fine, I’ll be John McEnroe.
Simon: It wasn’t up for debate, cunt.
After a few rounds, we went to a bar down the street, one that Simon had been frequenting. The three of us shared a joint on the way there. Simon, fittingly, would forget to pass it because he wouldn’t stop rambling on. I had to keep reminding him, which got old quick. “Uh, hey buddy. Remember, weed burns even while you’re not hitting it. If it was your weed, I wouldn’t say anything. But, seeing as I paid for it, you should keep it moving.”
The bar was spectacular. Some might not have liked it, but I sure did. It reminded me of a Day’s Inn conference room, with its’ white stucco walls, and foldable card tables. There was no TV. In fact, there was nothing in there at all. It was just a plain room with a tiny bar, that housed the beer. No liquor was sold, just bottles of Czech beer. When we entered there were 5 guys sitting at a table, all of them old as sand. They waved us over to join them. We up pulled seats, and they motioned to the bartender with three fingers in the air. The bartender, who must’ve been 80 years old, walked them over to our table. Simon immediately opened his using his teeth, a truly unhinged act. We all clinked bottles, and from there on we were all best friends. Who needs language when you have drinks?
Those old men could drink, let me tell you. After 5 or 6 beers the bartender came over and placed an unmarked bottle filled with a clear liquid, onto the table. I know moonshine when I see it, and that was it. We took shots out of tiny paper cups like you find in the dentist’s office until none of us could stand. One of the old guys fell on the way to the bathroom. Caroline and I picked him up, while Simon and the others laughed. Apparently, that happened to him often.
We sang and danced to Czech radio music, and acted like fools for hours. My face hurt from smiling.
Our bill came out to about $5 USD. Kevin was right, obviously. I left way more than that, and we stumbled home.
Caroline and I held hands on the way back. I could tell she wanted me to kiss her, but the time wasn’t right. Simon was still there, leeching. Every time we got close, he would scoff.
Simon: Ahh, fuck off you two.
Me: Thank you, Simon. I really appreciate you doing this.
Simon: Ooohhh, he’s pissed. Don’t throw your racket at me, Johhny Mac.
When we got back, Caroline and I still wanted to hang out, so we told Simon we were going to bed. Caroline, in her motherly way, insisted Simon do so too. After she tucked him in, her and I went down to the cave bar. We drank water and talked. Water is truly the key to pulling off alcohol and drug addiction. 2 gallons a day, at least, if you want to stay limber.
Caroline: So, why are you here by yourself, in Europe?
Me: I’m running.
Caroline: From what?
Me: Myself. Since my dad died, I feel like I can’t stop. If I do, I’ll have time to think. And I don’t want to think.
Caroline. I understand.
Me: Why are you here?
Caroline: Same reason, really. My younger brother died last year. When I’m home in Perth, I can’t get him out of my mind. He died in a car accident, along with our dogs.
Me: That’s terrible.
Caroline: How about we run together?
Me: I’d like that. Where to next?
Caroline: I heard Bratislava was nice.
Me: Where is that?
Caroline: It’s the capital of Slovakia. Have you ever seen the movie “Hostel”?
Me: No.
Caroline: Good. Don’t. Tomorrow we can take a bus. It’s a short ride.
By the time I got up the next morning, Simon had already weaseled his way into our plans. During breakfast, Caroline gave me a look as if to apologize. I couldn’t be upset though; Simon was a persistent one, I would have given in too.
Simon: Let me get some more of that speed. That was good shit.
Me: Goddamn you, Simon.
I gave him the 10mg pill, which he took immediately, in front of everyone.
Simon: Hey Johnny, we’re going to get pissed today, aren’t we?
Me: You just watch yourself, Ok? And please, don’t open any more beers with your mouth. It makes me sick.
It was only a 2-hour ride from Prague to Bratislava, but that didn’t deter Simon from bringing along a whole case of beer. He bought it though, and carried it, so I didn’t complain. Plus, it was nice to get some reciprocation after getting him high with my good Amsterdam weed for the past two days. The beer was the only luggage he took. I didn’t ask if he had more clothes, or any belongings at all, but I was curious. Best not to ask questions you don’t want the answers to.
He was 2 beers deep before we even boarded. With each one, he’d covertly pop the cap off then put it back on, before pretending to open it with his teeth, giving me a childish look in the process. At that point I’d stopped caring, but he wouldn’t let it go. He was an instigator that way. I’ve never understood why some people show affection by teasing. You can only pull off teasing if you’re funny and have tact. Otherwise, you just sound like an annoying asshole. Timing is everything.
Caroline and I sat next to each other, while Simon sat behind us. He smelled like he hadn’t showered in a week, and he probably hadn’t. When the metal chains on his leather jacket clanged against the poor old woman sitting beside him, she clutched her bag and turned towards the window. I felt terrible for her, having to sit next to a drunken stink bomb like that for 2 hours. He was disgusting.
Speaking of disgusting… I was always embarrassed when my dad and I went out in public together. He was impossible not to stare at because of how fat and unkempt he was. And I was his son, so I got stares too. Food is the worst drug in that way. Most addictions aren’t noticeable to the naked eye, but with food, there’s no way to hide it, unless you purge. My mom always told me that everyone is too caught up in their own lives to notice other people’s insecurities, but I never believed her. I knew they were looking, wondering how a child like me could come from a man like that. I could feel their indictments of him as a father; I could feel their pity. I felt it all. Those feelings have never left me, even long after his death. I can still feel those eyeballs on me.
It was a peaceful first hour. Caroline and I read from our books while knocking knees. The unspoken intimacy was lovely. She was on her second read of a Virginia Woolf book I can’t remember the name of, just like I was on my second read of my Hunter Thompson book. We both sipped our beers and enjoyed the nice cross breeze wisping through the bus. The sun was out, and we were in just the right place at just the right time.
With only about 15 minutes left in the ride, I reached back to grab another beer from the box on Simon’s lap. That’s when I saw the flashing lights behind us. It was a police van, and it was rapidly approaching. When it got closer it became clear that we were the ones being pulled over.
Me: Uh, what the fuck is going on?”
Simon: It’s usually just standard shite. Don’t worry.
Me: Usually?!
Several police officers boarded the bus, all of whom were holding automatic rifles and looking very serious. I swear, in Europe everyone with even a modicum of authority gets a machine gun. They went around checking passports. When they got to me, I was terrified. My bag and pockets were filled with weed, hash, and a bunch of loose Adderall pills. Also, I was American. Being an American in Europe is almost as bad as being black in America. Boy, being black in Europe must be double awful.
I handed the cop my passport, and instead of handing it back, he put it in his pocket and escorted me off the bus. I was the only one singled out. Everyone else just sat comfortably, drinking their beers. The jig was finally up, and my worst nightmare was coming true. “If this is what happens in the movie Hostel, I’m going to kill Caroline for not warning me,” I thought to myself.
He asked me a bunch of questions that I obviously didn’t understand, while repeatedly checking my passport and shaking his head from side to side. It was like I was being questioned by a squirrel. I had no clue what he wanted from me or how I could appease him. I tried to look like an upstanding gentleman by buttoning up my cardigan and straightening my posture, but it didn’t seem to be working. He saw right through me.
I could see Simon in the window of the bus. He was giving me the international sign for throat-slashing. I wasn’t sure if he was implying that I should kill myself to avoid Slovakian prison, or if he was telling me I should find a way to slit the officer’s throat and escape. Probably the latter, knowing him. Caroline too had come to the window. I could see the concern on her face. If she was scared, I knew I was in trouble.
They had me out on the side of the road for ten agonizing minutes while they talked on their radios. The bus driver came out at one point to ask what the holdup was, and they swiftly sent him back on the bus. Now, everyone was concerned. I got Caroline’s attention through the window.
Me: Caroline, grab a pen… My name is Sam Rosenberg, NOT John McEnroe. My mom’s name is Audrey. She lives in Northbrook, Illinois. Please tell her —
Then, it all ended, just like that. No bag check, no pat down, no nothing. They just sent me on my not so merry way, with my passport. The bus driver gave me a snide look, like I’d messed up his schedule, but I didn’t care. I’d dodged another bullet. Simon opened a beer with his teeth and handed it to me.
Simon: This deserves a celebration.
Our hostel wasn’t the most fashionable, but it was cheap, and right downtown. The room fit 8 people. It was the three of us and 5 Italian guys who were all clearly friends. When we got to the room, they were eating spaghetti with their shirts off. It was wildly apropos. When they offered us each a bowl, Caroline and I politely declined. Simon, on the other hand, scarfed one down in less than a minute.
Simon: You call this pasta? It’s shite, mate. Sorry to tell you.
They didn’t understand.
Italian Guy: Si, pasta. Prego, prego.
Me: Prego?
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Caroline: (understanding the double entendre) Not the brand, Sam.
Simon: Ahem, his name is Johnny.
Caroline: It means “you’re welcome.”
Me: Ah, grazie.
Italian Guy: Si, prego.
Right down the street from our hostel was a bar called The Dubliner. It looked exactly like you’d expect it to look. There’s no need to even describe it. Irish bars are perfect that way, you always get what you expect, regardless of the country you’re in. The food and liquor are the same, as is the décor. They are, if nothing else, reliable. And reliability is everything.
Caroline and I sat at a table together, drinking Guinness, while Simon roamed around the bar swilling Jameson and accosting random strangers. “I’m here with John McEnroe!” he’d tell anyone who’d listen. He was blacked out. 12 beers in 2 hours will do that to you.
Simon got punched in the face and thrown out within an hour. I didn’t see it but apparently, he spit in some guy’s face after being called a cunt. Then thee guy decked him with a single punch. As someone who used the word so often, I’d expect Simon to be less sensitive to being called one himself. Caroline and I were tossed too because we came with him. He tried fighting every single person on the way out, but Caroline and I just stood there and watched. There was no way I was fighting on his behalf. The last time I did that was in 4th grade when a friend got jumped for using a racial slur. I have regretted it ever since and still think of the guy as a racist piece of shit.
When the hullabaloo concluded, Simon’s face was bloodied, but he still wanted to drink.
Me: You need to go back to the hostel. They won’t let you into a bar with blood all over your face and shirt. That’s surely a universal rule.
Simon: Fuck that. When someone in Dublin gets punched in the face, the bar buys them drinks.
Me: We are not in Dublin.
Caroline: Sam and I are going to eat. You can’t come. You need to rest.
To my amazement, Simon heeded her advice and stumbled back to the hostel to crash. I felt sorry for the Italians because I knew he’d finish their spaghetti and/or try to fight them. At least it was five against one, and Simon could hardly stand, so I wasn’t too worried about them.
Caroline and I set out to find the nicest restaurant we could. We’d both been skimping on money for weeks and finally wanted to splurge now that we were amongst good company. We walked around for half an hour holding hands, chatting about food. Caroline told me she used to cook for her late brother, “Damby,” as she called him (because she couldn’t say “Danny” when she was little). She’d make him minced meat pies on Sundays after church. They were his favorite, and he’d eat them inside-out, saving the crust for last (I do the same). The recipe came from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother before her.
I told her about my Bubbie, and the fried latkes she’d make for me after school. I always thought the jelly would cool them down faster, but it really just cooled the exterior, lulling me into a burnt mouth. I never learned my lesson. We traded food story after food story, our faces lit up, until we had none left.
Food is the easiest way to make bonds, Bourdain taught me that, and I’ve always found it to be true. We all eat.
Downtown Bratislava was way more beautiful than I’d expected. The streets were cobblestone, but the buildings were modern; a dichotomy that somehow worked. It perfectly combined the old world with the new. And the place oozed romanticism. It was like a poem come to life. Everything Disneyland claims to be, Bratislava actually was. If you’re proposing to someone, I suggest doing it there. You will no doubt get a “yes.”
We found a white-tablecloth, French restaurant to dine in. They didn’t seem to care about our casual attire even though the place was fancy, which impressed me. Everyone who can afford a meal should be accommodated, regardless of their attire. Miss me with that classist shit. Before ordering we decided we’d share so we could try more dishes. We got escargot to start. Always start with escargot if they have it. Then we had an omelet, followed by a quiche. For our main courses we shared duck confit and beef bourguignon. Everything was insanely good, like eyes rolling back and moaning good. The price didn’t matter, though they were on the Krona too, so it only came out to what amounted to $40 USD.
We were enveloped in each other that night. The vibes were electric. We flirted and teased, properly, on the walk back. We were about to enter the hostel, when Caroline grabbed my arm.
Caroline: Do you have a girlfriend?
Me: No. Do you have a boyfriend?
Caroline: No.
I knew an opportunity when I saw one, so I leaned in and gave her a kiss.
Caroline: (Pulling away) Just kidding, I do.
Me: What?!
Caroline: Haha, you should see your face.
Me: Why did you do that?
Caroline: To fuck with you.
Me: I don’t appreciate that.
Caroline: (mockingly) I’m Sam, and I don’t appreciate jokes even though I was a comedian. Shut up and kiss me again, you sensitive man you.
I kissed her again, this time pulling her close.
Me: Whoa, that was awesome. Let’s do that more.
I usually say some very awkward shit during and after moments of passion. It’s like the side effect I get from a boner is Tourette’s. I’ve been known to say “thank you” after I cum. It’s not something I’m proud of.
Caroline: I have an idea… How about we go somewhere else, without Simon, and pretend to be a couple? Like, just for a few days. We can go our separate ways after that.
Me: I dig that. But how are we going to get rid of Simon?
Caroline: Leave that up to me.
We made out for a few more minutes before going upstairs. Simon was still passed out, and the Italian guys weren’t back yet, so we laid in my bunk and dry humped quietly for a little while. Part of me couldn’t believe I was hooking up with such an awesome chick, but the other part wished it was Meghan. I kept my mouth shut, as to not ruin our moment, but I felt guilty, like I was using her. Before going to bed, I wrote in my journal:
Why are you like this? Who are you trying to spare in this situation? You’re not even dating Meghan, and Caroline REALLY likes you. You don’t have to be in love with her to have some fun. I mean, you just had sex with a prostitute, how is this worse than that? Ignore your silly morals for once and take a chance. Put yourself out there. Meghan would want you to.
It was easier to ditch Simon than we’d expected because I’m pretty sure he had a concussion. I tried to wake him up a few times, because I knew you weren’t supposed to sleep in that situation, but he kept telling me to fuck off. Caroline finally had enough.
Caroline: Simon, Sam and I are leaving. We will say a prayer for you. Drink water and don’t look directly into bright lights for a few days.
Simon: You cunts. You’re going to leave me here, like this? Sam, I need more speed.
Me: No. And it’s Mr. McEnroe to you.
Caroline pulled me out of the room by my arm before we could hear any more of his pleading. I was insulted by everything Simon did, but that demand infuriated me. I wanted to go back in there and smother him with a pillow. I guess that’s what I get for always seeing the best in people, and for sharing my drugs. Friends like these, eh dude?
Caroline and I went right to the train stop after buying some candy for the trip. She loved the sour stuff. The sourer, the better. In my experience, sweet people like sour candy, and sour people like sweet candy. I’ve ran the numbers, trust me. We didn’t know where to go, so we looked at a map on the wall.
Me: So where to ma’am?
Caroline: Why don’t you just close your eyes and point?
Without waiting for my response, she got behind me and covered my eyes. Then, she spun me around a few times, before placing me back in front of the map. I pointed to a spot.
Caroline: I hear Vienna is nice.

Well, they say! Home is where our heart is. I left a small part of my heart at the golden hour over the Charles Bridge.
With the busy life we all have, traveling is the place where you destress. Life with a toddler is never easy. I started to rethink the concept of traveling after my child was born.
Sigh! With the doubts and rethinking, we finally started planning our travel to open our summer in Europe. Springs are really special in Europe. That is when you still can’t find many tourists in the beautiful cities.
Luckily we started this whole trip with the right planning. We thought to make a fun road trip through the Autobahn. We live in the beautiful city of Utrecht province, and all our planning was around this.
Riding through the autobahn and landscapes of Germany, we were entertained well and our heart was calm. After a long journey and our halts through cute stops in Germany, we finally reached Prague at nearly midnight.
Tiring ourselves through sitting, we just wanted to rest our heads on the pillow, but our little one wanted to swim. Through a lot of convincing, we had a good night’s sleep. My subconscious mind made me feel for a while, we were still driving in the car, but my tired eyes were not able to focus on thoughts and we slept.
Our next day started with a nice morning view of the city of Prague through the large side windows of our hotel room.
Pro tip: Try to find a hotel where, your little one can enjoy amenities and activities like swimming, playroom, or lawn. This keeps them happy through the day and grownups can have a stroll.
After a great breakfast and swim, we finally started exploring Prague.
Our first stop was at the Prague castle complex, where we walked and witnessed the glorious monuments of St. Vitus Cathedral, a former royal palace, and other museums. The collection of views of the cities was breathtaking. One could also visit Golden Lane in the same complex. Never forget to click a picture here, just a great way to summarise your castle tour.
Pro tip: Check for tickets at any information center in Prague city. There is only a collective ticket available for all the important monuments.
A modern bold building by Architect Vlado Milunić along with Frank Gehry. Originally it was named Ginger and Fred building after the dancers. The bold piece of art is in the middle of the busy street, otherwise on your way to the famous walking route of old Prague city and the famous bridges.
Walking down the 15th-century Golden Lane took us back to those days. This preserved street is just worth experiencing, as most of the fort is reconstructed to adapt to current days.
This was a cute short ride, which our little one enjoyed. The funicular is been in operation since 1891. During the season( Between Apr-May season) you can enjoy cherry blossoms and other beautiful trees on this hill. The hill also has an interesting observatory. But it is a good experience on a sunny day to walk down the hill with your little one
Pro tip: You can have public transport 24-hour tickets at the information center or on any tram/ bus itself. I would suggest watching the YouTube channel HONEST GUIDE. He spoke about everything a tourist needs in Prague to walk like a confident local
Our final destination…..🥁🥁🥁
We started from our nearest metro station and walked through the beautiful old town of Prague. Our important pit stop was to witness the oldest astronomical clock in the world which is dated back to 1410, at the old town square. What is it? one may ask. If it interests you further, Astronomical clock.
Taking our imagination of walking through the 18th century, we reached the arch of Charles Bridge. Magnificent as it is, it took us to an old world that is built over the Vltava River. The 30 Baroque statues welcomed us to witness the glory of history.
We were lucky enough to reach the bridge in the golden hour. That is when I fell in love with Prague. Romantic Prague! We witnessed a rainbow which made it the perfect end to our romantic walk. We witnessed the sun going down dancing into colorful narration.
Further, when the sun went down. The view into the castle and of the city was spectacular.
I hope you enjoyed my little narration and it helped you to plan your future trip to Prague or made you remember your best evening.
Thank you for reading!

The Prague Solo Adventure That Changed How I See Myself (And Why Your Prague Itinerary for Solo Female Travelers Should Be Your Next Big Move),https://medium.com/@simplitty/the-prague-solo-adventure-that-changed-how-i-see-myself-and-why-your-prague-itinerary-for-solo-a57ac371f3bf,"Sign up

Hey there, fellow wanderers!
Picture this: a slightly panicked introvert standing in the middle of Old Town Square at 6 AM, clutching a lukewarm coffee and wondering what on earth she’s doing in Prague all by herself. That was me, three years ago — more anxiety than passport stamps, about to embark on what would become the most life-changing week ever.
Spoiler alert: I didn’t just fall in love with Prague’s fairy-tale architecture and ridiculously good goulash (seriously, the food is incredible!). I discovered a version of myself I never knew existed — the one who could navigate cobblestone streets confidently, eat dinner alone without checking her phone every five seconds, and actually enjoy her own company.
And honestly? I’m pretty sure you will too.
After four years of guiding tourists around Turkey’s stunning coastlines, I thought I had this whole travel thing figured out. I knew how to handle cranky tourists, navigate crowds without losing anyone, and make sure everyone felt safe and entertained. I was the person with all the answers, the backup plans, the emergency snacks.
But here’s the kicker — I’d never actually traveled just for me. Wild, right?
Every trip was about managing other people’s experiences, schedules, and expectations. I was always “on,” always responsible for someone else’s good time. Sound familiar?
So when I finally booked that solo trip to Prague, I honestly had no clue what I was getting myself into. My friends thought I was either incredibly brave or slightly unhinged (jury’s still out on that one). My family worried I’d spend the whole week talking to pigeons and eating sad hotel room crackers.
Oh boy, was I wrong about everything.
The real transformation didn’t happen at the famous Prague Castle or on that Instagram-perfect Charles Bridge everyone raves about. Nope. It happened on day three, in this tiny café tucked away in Lesser Town, where I spent two glorious hours reading a book, sipping what might have been the best coffee of my life, and realizing something mind-blowing:
I was genuinely enjoying my own company for the first time in… well, maybe ever.
Okay, let me be completely honest with you — Prague totally spoiled me for other cities. It’s like the universe took notes on what anxious introverts need and designed the perfect solo travel playground.
Here’s why Prague works so beautifully for us nervous first-timers:
It’s Ridiculously Safe (Even for Overthinkers Like Me)
I walked everywhere. Day, night, through winding medieval streets that looked straight out of a fairy tale. The scariest thing that happened? Getting mildly turned around near Wenceslas Square (which, fun fact, isn’t actually a square but more like a really long street — Prague loves keeping you on your toes!).
The city center is compact, well-lit, and there are always people around. Plus, Czech people are generally pretty reserved and respectful, which means you won’t deal with aggressive street harassment or pushy vendors trying to sell you overpriced “authentic” souvenirs every five minutes.
Basically, Prague lets you dip your toes into solo travel without throwing you into the deep end.
Your Wallet Will Actually Love You
One of my biggest solo travel fears was accidentally bankrupting myself on overpriced tourist food. You know that panic when you realize you just paid €25 for a sad sandwich near the Eiffel Tower? Yeah, Prague laughs at that nonsense.
I ate like an absolute queen for the price of a mediocre airport meal back home. Traditional Czech meals with beer (yes, beer!) often cost less than a single appetizer in most major European cities. This means you can actually enjoy yourself without constantly calculating exchange rates and having mini panic attacks about your credit card bill.
It’s Like Living Inside a Disney Movie (But Real)
I’m not being dramatic when I say Prague looks like someone took every fairy-tale castle, medieval fantasy, and romantic European dream and smooshed them together into one impossibly beautiful city. Walking through the streets genuinely feels like you’ve stepped into a storybook.
Which is perfect when you’re writing your own adventure story, right?
Day 1: Arrival and the Classic “What Have I Done?” Moment
I checked into my adorable little hotel in New Town (pro tip: stay somewhere central but not smack in the middle of tourist chaos), dumped my overpacked suitcase, and immediately felt that familiar flutter of anxiety.
You know the feeling — that voice in your head going, “Congratulations, you’ve officially made a terrible decision. Enjoy eating alone for a week, weirdo.”
Instead of hiding in my room scrolling social media like my introvert brain suggested, I forced myself to take a gentle walk toward the Powder Gate and Municipal House. The architecture literally stopped me in my tracks. I stood there for a solid ten minutes just gawking at all the intricate details on the Municipal House facade like some kind of architectural tourist (which I totally was).
That evening, I found this cozy restaurant with bar seating — my secret weapon for solo dining — and had my first taste of svíčková. I was super skeptical about meat drowning in cream sauce (it sounds questionable, right?), but oh my goodness, it was absolutely incredible.
The elderly Czech woman sitting next to me smiled and nodded approvingly when I practically licked my plate clean. My first genuine human connection of the trip, and it was over mutual appreciation of comfort food. Perfect.
Day 2: Playing Tourist (But Flying Solo Style)
Old Town Square was everything I’d drooled over in Instagram photos and somehow even more magical in person. The famous Astronomical Clock show happens every hour, and yes, it’s honestly a bit underwhelming (sorry, Prague tourism board!), but there’s something genuinely special about being part of that collective moment with strangers from around the world.
The real treasure was the Church of Our Lady Before Týn with its dramatic Gothic spires that look like something straight out of a Tim Burton movie. I found a nearby café, ordered another incredible coffee (Prague’s coffee game is seriously underrated), and spent an hour sketching the towers in my travel journal while people-watching.
This became my daily ritual — finding quiet spots to observe and actually process what I was seeing instead of just snapping photos and moving on.
The Jewish Quarter hit me right in the feels in ways I hadn’t expected. The weight of history, the stunning beauty of the Spanish Synagogue with its intricate Moorish design, the sobering reality of the Old Jewish Cemetery — it reminded me why solo travel can be so powerful. You can take all the time you need to really feel and process heavy experiences without worrying about someone else’s comfort level or schedule.
Day 3: The Charles Bridge Revelation (AKA My “I Can Do This” Moment)
Here’s where things got interesting. I dragged my not-a-morning-person self out of bed at sunrise (definitely not easy!) to experience Charles Bridge without the usual crowds of selfie-stick wielding tourists.
Standing there in the golden morning light, with just a few dedicated joggers and adorable dog walkers for company, I had what I can only describe as a moment of pure, unexpected contentment.
I wasn’t frantically taking selfies or checking how many likes my last post got. I was just… there. Present. Enjoying the view and my own thoughts without any distractions or obligations.
It sounds almost too simple, but when you’re used to constantly managing other people’s experiences or being “on” all the time, these moments of genuine solitude feel absolutely revolutionary.
Lesser Town became my favorite neighborhood that day. It’s like stepping through a portal into the past, with narrow cobblestone streets (wear good shoes, trust me!) and baroque buildings painted in the most gorgeous soft pastels.
I stumbled upon the John Lennon Wall, completely covered in colorful graffiti and Beatles lyrics, and learned from a friendly local that it had been a symbol of peace and freedom during Communist times. These unexpected mini-history lessons happen constantly when you’re traveling solo — you actually have time to read the plaques, strike up random conversations, and really absorb the stories instead of rushing to the next photo op.
Day 4: Castle Conquering and Confidence Building
Prague Castle day meant serious uphill walking (note to past self: ALWAYS pack your most comfortable walking shoes!). The castle complex is absolutely massive — we’re talking small-city-on-a-hill massive. St. Vitus Cathedral made me actually gasp out loud with its soaring Gothic arches and stained glass windows that look like giant jewels.
But honestly? The real highlight was Golden Lane, this absolutely charming street of tiny, colorful houses where castle guards and craftspeople used to live. I spent almost an hour exploring each miniature dwelling, imagining the daily lives of people who once called these dollhouse-sized homes their own.
The confidence boost of navigating this enormous complex completely by myself — reading maps, making decisions about what to see and what to skip based purely on my own interests — felt like a masterclass in trusting my own judgment.
Day 5: Hidden Gems and Personal Discoveries
Vyšehrad Fortress became my absolute favorite discovery. It’s way less crowded than Prague Castle but equally stunning, with incredible views over the Vltava River and the city spread out below like a living postcard.
The peaceful cemetery where famous Czech artists and writers are buried became my spot for quiet reflection. I know that sounds morbid, but there was something deeply moving about walking among the elaborate tombstones and thinking about all the creative souls who once called Prague home.
I packed a little picnic lunch (cheese, bread, and local fruit from a market) and spent hours just sitting on the fortress walls, watching boats drift down the river and thinking about my life back home. These moments of pure solitude were becoming addictive in the absolute best way.
Day 6: Confidence in Full Bloom
By this point, I was navigating Prague’s winding streets like I’d lived there for months. I’d found my favorite café (Café Louvre, where Einstein apparently used to hang out — how cool is that?), discovered hidden gardens perfect for morning reading sessions, and even ventured into neighborhoods completely outside the tourist bubble.
The Museum of Alchemists and Magicians was wonderfully weird and perfectly Prague — quirky, mysterious, and slightly magical. That evening, I treated myself to dinner at this fancy restaurant I would never have chosen if I were worried about accommodating someone else’s preferences or budget.
Eating alone at a white tablecloth establishment felt like such a grown-up, confident thing to do. The waiter was lovely, recommending wine pairings and chatting about his favorite Prague neighborhoods. Another reminder that most people are genuinely kind when you’re open to connection.
Day 7: Saying Goodbye to My Transformed Self
My last morning, I made one final pilgrimage to Charles Bridge for sunrise. This time, I wasn’t nervous or uncertain about being alone. I was simply a woman who had spent a week getting to know herself in one of the world’s most beautiful cities.
The difference in my confidence from day one to day seven was honestly shocking. I’d gone from anxious and uncertain to genuinely excited about solo adventures.
Solo Doesn’t Equal Lonely (Revolutionary Concept, I Know)
This was my biggest fear going in and my most surprising revelation coming out. I had rich, meaningful experiences every single day. Sometimes through brief but lovely interactions with locals or fellow travelers, but mostly through rediscovering the genuine joy of my own company.
I’d somehow lost that in years of constantly accommodating other people’s needs, schedules, and preferences. Prague gave it back to me.
You’re Way More Capable Than Your Anxiety Wants You to Believe
Every small decision — which charming street to wander down, where to grab lunch, how to spend an unexpected free afternoon — built my confidence muscle. By the end of the week, I was making quick, intuitive choices and trusting my instincts in ways that genuinely surprised me.
That confidence didn’t magically disappear when I got home. It showed up in work meetings, personal relationships, and daily decision-making in ways I never expected.
Slow Travel is the Secret Sauce
Without anyone else’s agenda to consider, I could linger in places that spoke to my soul and skip things that didn’t interest me. I spent an entire afternoon in the peaceful Franciscan Garden just because it felt right. I revisited my favorite café three times because the coffee was perfect and the atmosphere made me genuinely happy.
No rushing, no compromising, no “we should probably see this because it’s famous.” Just pure, authentic exploration based on what actually interested me.
Where to Stay for Maximum Comfort and Confidence
Old Town is super convenient but touristy and expensive (and honestly kind of overwhelming). I absolutely loved New Town — central enough to walk everywhere but with more authentic local flavor and much better prices.
Vinohrady is perfect if you want to feel like a temporary Prague resident, with incredible cafés and tree-lined streets that feel genuinely residential.
Pro tip: Look for places with 24-hour reception and stellar reviews from other solo female travelers. I always read reviews specifically mentioning solo travel experiences — they’re gold mines of practical information.
The Art of Solo Dining (It’s Way Easier Than Your Brain Thinks)
Prague’s café culture is absolutely perfect for solo travelers. Look for places with bar seating or communal tables where eating alone feels natural and intentional rather than awkward.
Traditional beer halls and pubs are surprisingly solo-friendly too — there’s something about the casual, communal atmosphere that makes dining alone feel completely normal. Plus, locals often eat alone, so you definitely won’t stand out.
My foolproof strategy: always carry a book or journal. It gives you something to do with your hands and makes the whole experience feel purposeful rather than like you’re waiting for someone who’s running late.
Getting Around Like You Own the Place
Prague’s public transport is excellent and super safe, but honestly, you can walk to most major attractions from the city center. The medieval layout can be confusing (I got turned around more times than I care to admit), but that’s part of the charm.
The tram system runs frequently even late at night, and it’s efficient and reliable. Get a multi-day transport pass for convenience, and always use official taxis with yellow roof lights and clear company logos.
Download offline maps before you go — Prague’s winding streets can be tricky, and you don’t want to drain your phone battery when you need GPS most.
Safety Tips That Actually Matter (Not the Scary Stuff)
Keep your bag zipped and in front of you in crowded tourist areas — pickpockets definitely target distracted visitors around major attractions like Old Town Square and Charles Bridge. Save your accommodation’s address in your phone and grab one of their business cards to keep in your wallet.
Most importantly: trust your instincts. If something feels off, remove yourself from the situation. But honestly? The biggest safety threat in Prague is falling so hard for the city that you start researching apartment rental prices (definitely guilty as charged).
Here’s what nobody tells you about solo travel: it’s not really about the destination at all. Prague was absolutely incredible, but the real journey was completely internal.
I learned to trust my judgment, genuinely enjoy my own company, and make decisions based on what I actually wanted rather than what I thought I should want or what would make other people happy.
This newfound confidence didn’t conveniently stay in Prague when I flew home. It followed me into job interviews, personal relationships, family dynamics, and daily decision-making. It fundamentally changed how I approach challenges and how I see myself in the world.
If you’re reading this and feeling that familiar flutter of excitement mixed with absolute terror, that’s your sign. That’s exactly how I felt three years ago, standing in my kitchen with a Prague guidebook, wondering if I was actually brave enough to book the trip.
Here’s the truth: I wasn’t particularly brave. I was just curious enough to feel the fear and explore anyway.
Prague is waiting for you right now. Not just the city with its stunning architecture, incredible food, and fairy-tale streets, but the version of yourself you’ll discover wandering those ancient cobblestones. The woman who can confidently navigate foreign cities, make decisions based on her own desires, and genuinely enjoy her own amazing company.
Your Prague itinerary for solo female travelers isn’t just another vacation plan — it’s an invitation to meet the most interesting person you’ll ever travel with: yourself.
So pack your curiosity, leave those doubts at home, and get ready for the most important conversation of your life. Prague is an excellent listener, and I have a feeling you might be surprised by what you discover you have to say.
Ready to start planning your own transformation? Your solo Prague adventure is just one brave click away. Trust me, your future self will thank you for being curious enough to take that first step.

Most people know Prague for its cheap beer and beautiful bridges, but did you know that the city has a blossoming art gallery scene, too?
Prague truly has something for everyone. Are you a fan of historical art? What about contemporary art? The city has it all — if you know where to look. But even if you don’t, don’t worry. That’s what this guide is for, after all!
Here’s a list of some of the best must-see galleries in Prague you can’t miss.
Fun fact: Prague’s National Gallery is one of the largest art museums in Central Europe. It has several buildings across the city. Honestly, if you want to see all of it, you might want to extend your trip by a couple of days! That’s how much art there is for you to admire.
Whether you’re interested in the old masters, Czech modernism, or international contemporary exhibitions, this gallery needs to be on your travel itinerary.
It’s a must-see for anyone who’s looking for a deep dive into Czech and European art.
I’ll admit — this one is a personal favorite of mine. There’s no better way to spend the afternoon in Prague than visiting DOX and seeing whatever exhibition they currently have on. They never miss!
DOX Centre for Contemporary Art is Prague’s leading modern art space. Here, you can expect thought-provoking exhibitions, modern architecture, and a permanent rooftop airship installation with some cozy beanbags inside.
It’s located in the Holešovice district, which is full of artistic cafés, beautiful plant stores, and small independent shops that you can get lost in. Perfect for an artsy day out!
This Prague art gallery is a must-see for contemporary art lovers.
Kampa Museum is all about modern European art. They especially spotlight Czech and Central European artists. Here, you can see the works of František Kupka and Otto Gutfreund, as well as other rotating exhibits.
This beautiful gallery also has an exciting location — you can find it on Kampa Island by the Vltava River. That’s right — it’s on an actual island. In the middle of mainland Europe!
If you’re looking for a unique setting with stunning views, this is the one for you.
MeetFactory is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. This contemporary gallery and artist residency was founded by David Černý, a famous Czech artist who also designed the famous Rotating Head of Franz Kafka.
MeetFactory is all about avant-garde exhibitions, live performances, and experimental installations. It’s perfect for edgier travelers who want to see something different.
If you’re interested in experiencing Prague’s alternative art scene, you really shouldn’t miss this one!
Schwarzenberg Palace is technically part of the National Gallery, but it definitely deserves its own spot on this list. It’s a beautiful place, which makes sense. After all, it’s actually a Baroque palace that was only later turned into an art gallery. Its highlights include Czech Baroque and Renaissance paintings and sculptures.
For its historical setting showcasing classic masterpieces, of course. Also, it’s near Prague Castle, another popular tourist destination — why not do a little 2-in-1?
Leica Art Gallery in Prague is a must-visit spot for photography lovers. It specializes in fine art photography by both Czech and international photographers. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, add this one to your itinerary. And don’t forget to check out the Leica camera store, too!
This one is a must for photography enthusiasts.
Last but not least, we have the Rudolfinum Gallery, which is a historic concert hall with a contemporary art gallery. It’s located by the Vltava River, near the Old Town, meaning that just walking there will take your breath away.
The Rudolfinum Gallery offers exhibitions of modern and contemporary art, despite how old and majestic it may look from the outside.
This gallery combines fine art with one of Prague’s most beautiful buildings. It also has a fun name. The Rudolfinum. Try not to think about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer while putting that name into Google Maps. I dare you.
The Rudolfinum is a gorgeous building, but it’s not the only one. Prague is a beautiful city with many views worth taking in. This is why river cruises are so popular here. If you want to see more of the city but don’t have a ton of time to walk everywhere, a cruise is the perfect solution.
You can try this Panoramic Vltava River Cruise by Get Your Guide, which will take you around Prague’s most famous landmarks, including Kampa Island, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, and more.
Disclaimer: The above link is an affiliate link. If you choose to go on the cruise, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. No pressure, though!
In case it wasn’t obvious, Prague’s art scene is super diverse. Whether you’re a modern art enthusiast or a lover of the classics, you won’t be disappointed by checking out these gorgeous galleries. So, don’t forget to add them to your travel plans.
Which of these Prague art galleries will you visit first? Let me know in the comments!

My final destination in my post-graduation European trip was Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. There are many things to do in this city and I particularly like the variety in food, especially in meats. Duck, rabbit, deer, geese, and wild boar meat are quite common in restaurants throughout the city. From high-end restaurants to more casual dining places, Czech food offers a lot of variety. The Prague nightlife is also great, and I would sometimes have less time in the day to go sightseeing because I would return to my hotel late at night to catch up on sleep after an eventful evening.
One of the first places I visited in Prague was Prague Castle. The castle’s history dates back to 870, when it was first used as a church and a fort. The fort later became a medieval castle, and served as the residence of the Kings of Bohemia, the Holy Roman Emperors, the Presidents of Czechoslovakia, and currently it is the official office of the President of the Czech Republic.
Visiting Prague Castle was quite sentimental for me because I visited the castle when I was 15 and had fond memories of that visit. It was great to see it again and I had a sense of nostalgia walking around. Occasionally I would recognize something I remember from six years ago. Since the castle stands high upon a hill, I particularly enjoyed the great views of Prague while walking around the castle walls. Because of how large the castle…

This magical city of Prague! No other place can leave such a living memory. No other city looks at its visitors with such wonderful eyes. Prague is the city that can make you fall in love with it!
In this article, we are going to give you 5 most popular tourist tips for curious travelers. Slowly carrying out all the points and enjoying your trip, you will get the most complete impression of this wonderful city and its traditions.
Let’s start our unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague!
1. Walk along the Charles Bridge
Prague’s oldest bridge is built of sandstone blocks, flanked at each end by fortified towers (Lesser Town Bridge Towers, Old Town Bridge Tower). From 1683 to 1928, thirty statues of saints were carved to decorate the bridge, the most famous of which is the statue of St John of Nepomuk.
From the bridge, you will have amazing views over many Prague’s medieval towers, churches, and palaces. The view towards Lesser Town, dominated by the Prague Castle complex, is very picturesque.
The best time to visit Charles Bridge is early in the morning or at night when it is not crowded. You can climb two towers standing on both ends of the Bridge for a magnificent view of Prague and the bridge from above.
You can get to the Charles Bridge when taking the tram number 12, 20, 22 or 23, getting off at station Malostranse Namesti.
The Charles Bridge over the Vltava River is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Prague. Its towers and sculptures are worth to be seen!
2. Admire the architecture of Old Town Square and watch a unique Astronomical Clock performance
Wander through the Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí), where the true heart of Prague beats!
The elegant tower of the Old Town Hall with the world famous Astronomical Clock, the monumental Church of St. Nicholas and countless colorful houses of many styles give this place a unique atmosphere, which will mesmerize you if you decide to take a look at its charm.
Not avoiding a crowd of tourists, watch a performance on an Astronomical Clock at the Old Town Hall, called “The Apostle Parade”. Its main function was to depict the movement of the Sun and the Moon; showing the time was merely a secondary element. The Apostle figures became part of the clock in the middle of the 16th century.
Very much has been written about the performance itself, but nothing will convey that atmosphere of mystery and admiration that reigns over the square during this performance. For a greater impression during the presentation, be sure to remember that the clock was built in the 15th century and has not undergone any tangible changes since that time.
The Apostle parade can be seen on the Prague Astronomical Clock every hour on the hour from 9 a.m. till 11 p.m. However, it is better to watch it in the morning, when there are relatively few people on the square. To take the most advantageous place, come to the clock 15 minutes beforehand.
While walking along the historical center, try famous Czech trdelnik, a kind of spit cake, made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick and topped with sugar and walnuts. Here you can eat a fried sausage and drink Czech beer.
All this must be done by sitting on a free bench and enjoying the surrounding pictures. In winter, the beer can be replaced with hot mulled wine or grog.
3. Enjoy a classic performance in Prague National Theatre
The National Theatre in Prague belongs to the most important Czech cultural institutions with a rich artistic tradition. Today the National Theatre consists of three artistic ensembles — opera, ballet, and drama. Operas are sung mostly in Italian and are accompanied by both Czech and English subtitles.
Visit Giuseppe Verdi´s La Traviata and Aida, Camille Saint-Saens´ Samson and Dalila, or very popular Georges Bizet´s Carmen. If you want to see something by Czech authors, there is Bedrich Smetana´s Hubicka (The Kiss), Tajemstvi (The Secret), and famous Rusalka.
Another scene of the National Theater is the Estates Theater. On this stage, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart´s La Clemenza di Tito, Don Giovanni, La Nozze di Figaro, and The Magic Flute are staged.
If you prefer the Ballet, you can visit Adolphe Charles Adam´s Giselle or project Solo Pro tri (Solo for three).
Both of the buildings are very nice, performances are well prepared, done by the best Czech and world dancers and singers, prepared by great directors and choreographers. So if you like Opera or Ballet, it is worth to visit the National Theatre, as it can be a great cultural experience, and a way how to spend a pleasant evening in Prague.
Do you want to visit the smallest street in Prague and go inside these tiny houses?
4. Golden Lane or Zlatá ulička!
On the eastern side of the Prague Castle, not far from St. George’s Basilica, there is an unusual street called Zlatá ulička. It is considered a symbol of Prague, its historical heritage.
Colored facades of tiny houses emerge on the cobblestone pavement. Sixteen old buildings have survived here. Zlatá ulička itself is a kind of museum. In nine of them, there are mini-museums dedicated to the former inhabitants of the street. The rest are souvenir shops.
There is a legend that alchemists lived on this street, receiving elixirs of eternal youth, gold, and a philosopher’s stone for the Emperor.
In the house № 22 lived Franz Kafka; he worked here on the collection “The Village Doctor”. Now there is a bookshop in this building.
In the house № 14, marked with a sign depicting a cat, an owl, and a crystal ball, a fortune teller had her salon. Here is also a small house under № 27, once inhabited by a local healer. The house is filled with drugs and herbs, as befits a medieval pharmacy. A jeweler’s workshop can be viewed in the house № 15.
Try to find a house near the last lantern and ghosts of alchemists, prisoners of the White Tower and other former residents!
If you haven’t visited this magical street yet or missed it while being in Prague, I think now you are looking forward to making this destination your point number one.
Zlatá ulička is open every day 9:00–17:00. After 18:00 admission is free. But keep in mind that most souvenir shops are closed by this time.
How to get there? Go subway line A or tram 5, 12, 18, 20, 22 to the stop Malostranská.
5. Finally, climb the Petřín Hill and watch Prague from the Observation Tower
There are many parks and gardens in Prague, but we strongly recommend you to visit Petřín Hill as it offers a stunning view of the city’s red brick roofs.
Built as a mini version of Paris’s Eiffel Tower, the Petrin Observation Tower is 60m high. Climb 300 steps to reach the top of the tower, and the view over Prague is magnificent.
In the spring, hundreds of apples and cherries blossom there, filling the air with a heady aroma. Have a pleasant stroll around the rose garden.
Other attractions include an observatory, a museum, a telescope, a hall of mirrors, a church, and many nice cafes.
By the way, next to the Petřín Hill, there is the Kinský Garden (Zahrada Kinských). It is rather easy to go from one park to another, just find an arch in the wall that separates them. By the way, in the Kinský Garden, you can find the Transcarpathian ancient church.
Once you have enjoyed the views of Prague, we recommend you to have dinner in Nebozizek Restaurant near Petřín Hill. You can reach it on foot or by funicular.
To reach the Observation Tower at the top of Petřín Hill, take the Funicular Railway. It departs from Ujezd street in the Lesser Town (Malá Strana), near Ujezd tram stop.
I think now you must be ready for an amazing trip to Prague. We hope our recommendations for your unforgettable sightseeing tour around Prague will be helpful and you will enjoy it!
If you had something to take away, add a clap / respond / highlight / follow me and subscribe to get emails as soon as I publish. We all go further when we help each other!”
Cheers — KS !!

Nové Město (New Town) is a part of Prague I’ve always had ambivalent feelings about, but I’ve grown to appreciate it over time.
It hugs the Old Town from East and South, and stretches from the bustling Náměstí Republiky almost all the way down to Vyšehrad, including places like Main Railway Station, Národní třída, Wenceslas Square, Charles Square, and the recently completed Masaryčka building, just to name a few. The topic of my first article, the National Theatre is also located in this district. It’s a more vibrant, modern area with a true metropolitan feel, and always buzzing with activity — very different from the peaceful charm of Hradčany.
Though it’s not one of my absolute favorite areas, Nové Město continues to surprise me with its potential, especially for traditional street photography. It offers movement, energy, and bold architectural contrasts, making it a fascinating place to explore with a camera.
People here are mostly busy with something, and it’s a joy to watch, to observe: window cleaners inside and outside, maintenance workers occupying entire sidewalks, shopkeepers sweeping the entrances of pubs, tourists unfolding paper maps with a mix of determination and confusion — it’s incredible to see paper maps still being used in 2024 (crazy and cool in the same time)! These small scenes create a some-kind-of tapestry of life that feels dynamic and layered.
Compared to Hradčany’s calm streets and slower pace, Nové Město can almost feel overwhelming sometimes. But its open spaces and wider streets let you step back a little and just observe the flow. This breathing room helps balance the chaos, allowing little stories to unfold all around.
A big part of Nové Město’s architecture is more sharp, modern, and reflective — sometimes quite literally. Glass dominates much of the area, bouncing light and creating unexpected patterns.
While working with reflections isn’t my strong suit, I’ve noticed that many of my photographs feature glass shopfronts or deep, dark, harsh shadows. It’s become an unintentional theme of sorts, adding to the challenge and the creative process, I guess.
One of the newest additions to the neighborhood is the Masaryčka, an office building designed by Zaha Hadid. Its curves, bold angles, and futuristic look make it a fantastic backdrop. I haven’t managed to capture a photo here that I’m happy with yet, but I’m convinced it has potential. The way the building interacts with the streets and the train station right next to it makes it a challenge worth revisiting from time to time.
Not every corner of Nové Město is easy to work with — at least for me — but I’ve come to see it as a place full of potential. Take Wenceslas Square, for example. It often feels too crowded and chaotic for my liking, but its modern lines, constant movement, and extremely diverse mix of people offer endless opportunities to observe and capture something unique.
One funny struggle I often face is with my 35mm lens (I only have a Fuji X100 for digital). Many times, I spot something intriguing in the distance worth capturing, but I know it would just be a tiny dot in the frame. By the time I walk closer, the moment has already disappeared. In those situations, I console myself with the thought that noticing and observing such moments is part of the practice — I believe, it’s half the battle in creating a well-captured image.
Usually, I start walking without any specific ideas in mind, aside from occasionally seeking out only black-and-white shots. I let the city and my legs guide me, keeping an eye out for anything interesting that catches my attention. Nové Město has a way of rewarding this open-ended approach, often surprising me when I least expect it. Of course, like with other photowalks, I sometimes come home with zero decent shots — but with this area, I never know.
I’m not a fast-paced street photographer. If anything, I lean toward a slower approach — taking time to observe, waiting (when I’m in a patient mood — ha!), and letting moments and opportunities unfold naturally. In Nové Město, I find this method works well, often leading me to quieter details hidden within the city’s hustle.
So, if you’re visiting Prague and want a change of pace from its historic, postcard-perfect spots, take a walk through Nové Město. Let the city guide you, stay curious and don’t rush. Sometimes, the best moments come to those who wait.
Thanks for reading to the end! If you enjoyed this or have any thoughts, I’d really appreciate your 👏 claps and comments. See you in the next chapter!

The night the avant-garde German theater group performed at the Roxy Klub in Prague between the sets I was DJing, I knew it would get weird.
When the troupe lit an explosive, and it went off in the center of the dance floor, it caused several chunks of the plaster ceiling to rain down on the heads of the audience. After my ears stopped ringing, I cued up a song and spun some Groove Collective. Dancers filled the dance floor, gyrating around the hole left in the old cement floor by the performance artists’ dynamite.
It was another Saturday night at the Roxy in 1995.
I moved to the Czech Republic in January and was enrolled as a student at Karlova Univerzita in the mass communications department. Rather than go to class, I’d hang out with my professor, Cyril, who discovered that I was a musician and that I loved literature. He introduced me to the gang at Yazzyk Magazine.
Yazzyk was a periodical specializing in publishing East European authors and poets translated into English. It was run by a Canadian named Douglas and a Mexican-American named Tony. They hired me to be in charge of…

Athens, Vienna, & Prague
March 3rd & March 10th, 2025
Apologies, it’s been some time since my last words!
For the past two weeks, I have either been prepping for travel or have actually been moving, traveling to different countries!
March 3rd
Beginning with the long week of March 3rd, the week started off quite well, with lots on my mind, trying to prep for an absence of almost three weeks total. My flight leaving Portsmouth was on Thursday, March 6th, so I knew for the days leading up to it, I had lots to do, from getting schoolwork done before leaving, to cleaning my room and emptying my fridge, to also doing laundry and packing (which wasn’t too difficult as I’m only allowed one backpack for my budget flight ticket — which I realized after finishing my trip, I quite literally was able to do the infamous saying of “backpacking through Europe”!).
So after the somewhat stressful couple of days leading up to the trip was over, I finally was able to focus on the fun of the planning my friend Celeste and I had spent much time doing! Our first flight was to Athens, where we would stay for four nights. The flight was truthfully not the best, even though it was only four hours, it felt as if it took ages to land, thanks to the kid behind me kicking my seat, but nevertheless, we were landing in Athens, Greece, so what is there to complain about!
After figuring out how to get from the airport to the city center, we finally arrived in our (super) cozy hotel room! You’ll see why the room is so cozy in the pictures below, the bed frame was the length of the wall, haha! It was a funny encounter and experience, but it truly made our trip that much funnier and more of a memorable time 😁.
After settling into our room, it was quite late at night so we grabbed some quick food and then went to bed for our first night in Athens!
The next couple of days in Athens consisted of absolutely dreamy beautiful weather, with amazing food smells on every corner and glowing skin from the refreshing glistening Mediterranean sun. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Athens and wish I had more time to spend in the beautiful city, but I told myself it’s okay and that I would certainly make a return sometime in the future, hopefully sooner rather than later!
Some highlights of the trip were seeing the famous Ancient Greek ruins, such as the Acropolis and Parthenon, as well as visiting the waterfront, watching the sun set on the beautiful Mediterranean waters. Celeste and I were also able to meet one of our friends from Portsmouth in Athens to celebrate her birthday! We spent the day strolling throughout the beautiful city, eating delicious Greek cuisine and ending the night in a gorgeous rooftop bar with truly spectacular views of the Acropolis! Some things are better shown through pictures, so I’ll let the following pictures do the rest of explaining for our activities in Athens!
There was one other highlight of the trip that I can’t not mention, and that is Celeste and I’s encounter of a protest on a random street in Athens. So, quick story time:
It all started when Celeste and I wanted to watch the sunset on a beach along the coast of the city. The city center of Athens is actually quite far by foot to the coasts of the city, so we decided to take a bus to get us to the beach in a much easier and timely manner. Little did we know though that our innocent selves, waiting at the bus stop for a ride to the beach, would become witnesses to a quite significant protest in the city. It was a random Saturday in March on a random street in Athens in the middle of the afternoon when Celeste and I were waiting at the bus stop, watching numerous cars and buses pass by us, when all of a sudden the traffic passing by, stopped. All of a sudden, came a line of protestors holding a banner and chanting, and they entered the wide road and overtook the street. It began with quite a peaceful protest, simply walking together, united as one to fight for the cause they believed in, but within a matter of seconds, the protests escalated to another level. After long stretches of calm and peaceful protestors passed by, following just behind them was another group of protestors, but they were noticeably a different group of protestors. These young-adult looking individuals dressed in all black, covering their faces with black masks to hide their identities, came in strong after the peaceful protestors, making loud banging noises from the sledgehammers they had brought to damage public properties such as dumpsters, glass bus stops, and ATM stations. They further began to drag numerous dumpsters to the middle of the road and started fires in each dumpster… This all happened in a matter of seconds, right in front of us. Celarly, Celeste and I were quite shocked at what was happening, an experience that will truly be unforgettable for the rest of our lives. To make the experience even more memorable, out of natural instinct, we had our phones out and were taking pictures and videos of what was unfolding in front of us, but one of the young-adults in black noticed this and came up to my friend Celeste. She had been recording one of his comrades breaking an ATM with his sledgehammer, and immediately was telling her to delete the video. It was quite a heated yet calm interaction, as the boy seemed he just wanted to make sure there was no footage of them and their acts that could circulate throughout social media, is my presumption. So, after that quite stunning experience of a young man in black coming up to us and demanding us to delete a video, we realized that this definitely could escalate to a more dangerous situation. But, as I had mentioned, everything happened within a matter of seconds because shortly after that encounter, came a whole line of police troops dressed in army gear with gas masks and blockade shields, passing by us and heading towards the whole crowd of protestors. At that point, most of the protestors had made their way down the streets, so Celeste and I were luckily quite far from the protestors when we heard a loud popping noise and smoke erupt into the air from the presumed tear gas that the army had deployed at the protestors. We presumed tear gas because after the protest had settled, some protestors were pouring baby powder on their faces and eyes.
Ultimately, this once-in-a-lifetime experience was quite shocking and felt as if we were in a movie scene, casually waiting for a bus to take us to the beach, but ending in a deserted road, filled with dumpsters scattered across the streets with fire burning inside them, and papers flying in the winds from the protestors’ flyers thrown as they were chanting and walking down the streets of Athens. On the bright side though, we were completely safe, and truthfully I never felt a serious fear for my well-being, which is surprising, considering I tend to have quite an over-thinker paranoid mind. Also, after much troubleshooting of trying to find another bus and route to take us to the beach, we were able to end the day by watching the sun fall down onto the Mediterranean waters, a truly beautiful image that will also be a sight to remember!
March 10th
Moving onto our next journey, on March 10th, Celeste and I left our friend in Athens and met up with another one of our friends from Portsmouth in Vienna! We luckily found flight times that arrived in Vienna within an hour of each other so we were able to meet and reunite in the airport! From there, we figured out how to get to our accommodation, which was a nice and spacious apartment that was actually quite affordable after splitting the cost!
It was all our first time in Vienna so we were all super excited to explore the beautiful city, which began with the hunt for late-night food… food is always priority! 😄 After finding some delicious food, we walked back to our place and went to bed, ready to venture into the city, and also meet one of my friends studying in Vienna the following day!
The weather treated us quite well I’d say during our time there, which apparently, nice blue skies and wind-less spring temperature is not the regular weather in Vienna, so I guess we got lucky! Our two-day trip in Vienna essentially consisted of us three girls walking around, looking at famous landmarks while talking and sharing memorable moments, stopping at cafés and grabbing dinners to further enjoy ourselves and our time traveling together. It was truly an enjoyable time with my two friends, and I was fortunate enough to also meet up with another friend of mine who is currently living in Vienna for her studies! I met her during my working position at UNO as a Student Ambassador, so I was quite excited to meet back up with her, and in Vienna of all places!
After a few fun days of taste-testing Vienna’s most famous treats and venturing the streets of the beautiful city, a city I could definitely see myself coming back to, we packed our bags and got ready for our next journey to Prague!
Two days after Vienna, on March 13th, we took a train from Vienna to Prague which was quite short and enjoyable, and we got an interesting seating booth for the train, something I’ve never experienced before! In Prague, we had a similar agenda to Vienna, simply walking and exploring the city, enjoying our time together while also seeing the beautiful Historic European architecture of the city. In Prague, I was again fortunate to meet up with another friend who is currently studying in Brno, Czechia, a city not too far from Prague! She is a fellow student from UNO who is also on an exchange program, and we actually met through a previous study abroad experience at UNO a couple years ago! So, we got in touch and were able to meet in Prague for the day and explore the city together!
Prague was the farthest East country I’ve travelled to in Europe, and it was quite enjoyable up until an unfortunate circumstance occurred on our last day in Prague… but, we’ll address that later!
Overall, Prague as a city is quite enjoyable and has many beautiful sights to see, with some different, but tasty traditional meals. Unfortunately during our time there, it was quite rainy and cloudy and cold, but that didn’t stop our ventures and fun experiences in the city, including a river cruise with a lunch buffet! It was the first cruise with meal experience I’ve ever had, so it was quite enjoyable, sitting comfortably in the warmth of the boat while also seeing the city and eating delicious foods from the buffet (which I’d say we definitely got our money’s worth 😋). We also were determined to try a famous trending traditional dessert in Prague, one which I forgot the name of but will insert a picture of it below! It’s a delicious cone made of sugary bread filled with strawberries and melted chocolate (and sometimes ice cream), and it was quite enjoyable and definitely recommended for dessert lovers!
Now, onto the unfortunate circumstance…
It was our last day in Prague when we decided to try a famous café that ChatGPT recommended us to try. For the time we had spent in Prague, we used walking as our main form of transportation, as many things conveniently were located near each other. But, because it was our last day and we had been tired of walking around for many days prior, we decided to try out the public transit to rest our legs but also test out how to use their transportation system, as we needed to use the metro the following day to arrive at the airport from the city center. So, we walked to the tram stop that would take us to the café, where we looked for a ticket booth to buy a tram ticket, but there were none to be found. So, we assumed we would need to simply purchase a ticket on-board the tram, as some public transit systems have a tap-to-pay machine installed in the trams/buses. So, when the tram had arrived, we got on and saw a machine where the ticket could be bought. The tram was full of people, to the point that shoulders were touching for anyone nearby each other, and the only machine to buy the ticket was down near the exit door of the tram. So, we had planned to walk towards the back of the tram to the ticket machine, but the tram took off and we had lost balance for a bit, so we resettled and balanced ourselves, and shortly after this, a man in casual dark clothes approached us. He said “ticket check”, “I need to see your tickets”. We told the man, wearing no uniform but holding a ring badge to show his identity as a ticket inspector, that we had just got on the train and we needed to make our way down the train to purchase our tickets. He had quite a heavy accent and we were not completely sure if he understood what we had been telling him, but he kept repeating the question of needing to see our tickets, in which we kept responding that we had just arrived on the tram to buy them. He quickly became defensive and said that we are not allowed to ride the trams for free, stating in Czechia, people are not allowed to use public transit for free. He then asked us for our passports, implying that he knew we were not from the country, which attributes to my suspected belief that we were targeted for this “scheme” because we were quite obviously tourists. So, after he had taken our passports and “inspected” them, he told us that we had to follow him and leave the tram. He was holding onto all three of our passports at this point and was making his way towards the exit of the tram. So, I asked if we could get our passports back at least and he insisted that later he would give them back but we needed to follow him to exit the tram. From the time this man approached us and began assertively accusing us of trying to ride the tram for free, my suspicions of this man being a scammer was at the forefront of my mind. At that moment when he had taken our passports and was walking towards the exit of the tram, I was quite nervous and rushed to thinking that at any moment, this man could run and steal our passports (a fear of mine especially because this happened to my mom’s friend the last time she was in Prague). So, at that moment, I was a bit on edge about what could be the end result of this interaction with a man who claimed to be a ticket inspector. Luckily though, I kept my trails right behind him to ensure if anything were to happen, he wouldn’t be too far from me. We eventually all got off the tram and the man had told us yet again, that we were not allowed to ride the tram for free. We further continued to defend ourselves and describe our situation, as he truly had approached us after about a minute of stepping onto the tram. When we were talking to him about our situation, another man walked over in a similar non-uniform look, with the same ring badge, where he was consulted on what to do in this situation. This man, who was supposedly another ticket inspector, told us the same thing, that we weren’t allowed to be on the tram for free and because we didn’t pay for a ticket, we would be fined. This same man further asked what passports we held, and he saw an Italian and American passport, in which he made a quite abrasive and quite honestly offensive remark to the fact that we were Americans, which is yet another reason why I felt we were targeted. Ultimately though, these two men were saying that we had to pay the fine, and there was no way to get ourselves out of it, no matter how many times we had explained the circumstances we were in. They showed no leniency whatsoever and were constantly assertive in the fact that, because we hadn’t purchased a less than 2 Euro tram ticket at the time he had approached us, that we would be fined nearly 45 Euros each. He had further threatened that if we didn’t want to pay him now, ministry transport officers would be called and we would have to go to the ministry office of transport, and pay an even higher fine of almost 70 Euros. At this time, I had still had the idea that we could be confronted by scammers, so before agreeing to anything, I Googled the public transit fine laws in Prague to ensure that what he was saying, was valid. After looking at the ministry’s website and some articles, the man’s words had aligned with what the written laws stated, but, in my eyes, it still didn’t necessarily legitimize him as an authentic ticket inspector. The Google search I made also warned that some scammers may be at play, impersonating to be authentic ticket inspectors, so it warned that their badges should be inspected to authenticate their legitimacy. So, I had asked to see their badge, which I had already seen when the man first approached us, as he showed us his badge ring. I looked at the badge, but felt quite unknowledgeable, as I didn’t know how to tell if the badge was legitimate or not, so there wasn’t much I could do at that point. After this attempt, for a moment, we had collectively considered letting them call the ministry transit officers to come and prove their authenticity as ticket inspectors. But, they warned us, as the law stated, if we called the ministry transit officers, we would have to pay a higher fine than if we just agreed to pay these ticket inspectors there on the spot, which is one aspect of the city’s transit laws that I personally believe is truthfully, incredibly illogical and unfair. Ultimately, after being quite spooked and frazzled from the situation we found ourselves in, we decided to just pay the men the nearly 45 Euros they had asked for. After paying and leaving these men, we walked a couple steps away from the stop we were forced to be at, and had debriefed on what just happened. We were all quite emotional, feeling angry, scared, sad, nervous, and a bit skeptical about what had just happened. So, we did what any young lady would do in a frazzling situation such as this one, and all got on the phone with our mothers and described with all our emotions, the situation that just occurred. Ultimately though, our valuable Mothers’ advices were to not let this situation impact the rest of our day and time in Prague, and that at least we were safe and nothing terrible like our passports being stolen, happened. This was true, but for the rest of the day, our moods were all collectively quite down and we had felt quite irritated at the situation that had happened. In fact, we had been so scarred and angered from the situation, that the next day, we just booked an Uber to take us to the airport, and luckily this easier, stress-less, and more secure option wasn’t too much more expensive.
So, to come to a close on our experience and perceptions on Prague, our time there was truly quite nice and enjoyable up until the moment that we had arguably been targeted by the supposed ministry ticket inspectors of the city. So, as of now, I have mixed emotions and thoughts on Prague, and am not completely sure if it’s a city I feel I could return to again, which is quite unfortunate.
Ultimately though, to end the blog on a brighter note, after our upsetting last experience in Prague, we had a new journey to look forward to. On March 15th, we took the flight back “home” to London Gatwick, where we spent a couple hours in the airport eating and resting to gain energy for our next flight to Dublin, which was on the same day, and the next journey to be discussed!
So, reflecting on the past two-weeks spent abroad, there were many fun, new, and exciting experiences and memories, but it was also naturally a bit tiring, but as mentioned, the traveling did not stop there… who needs rest?!
So, until the next post and journey,
See you then!
From,
Kyla

Skeletons appear to crawl out of front yards. Some wave at me, and others seem to be enjoying themselves on porch swings as though they’re still dressed in muscle, organs, and skin and are filled with oxygen and life. Pumpkins line steps, some already carved, their faces misshapen and sagging from the heat in this part of the country, smiles now frowns melting onto the pavement.
Haunted houses are available throughout the city, replicating horrors we can also view on television and movie screens. These experiences provide people with the psychological opportunity to feel the relief of being able to survive or walk away from something that is not actually dangerous.
Sometimes, we walk through cities on “ghost tours” to hear stories about hauntings, what happened long ago to spur these legends, and to decide whether any spirits are restless. Maybe we go because we want to learn; perhaps we want to understand. Maybe we want to know the unknowable between life and death.
Executions of every variety were town spectator shows hundreds of years ago in Prague, and the heads of decapitated noblemen were suspended from the towers at both ends of the Charles Bridge. Macabre scenes like this…

After — back in May 2000 — I secured my monthly Metro pass, moved into my crash-pad, and got all of the visa, residence, and working permit paperwork half-way done, the real problem started: Where to get a coffee that actually deserves its name? Plus, what café or coffeehouse in good old Praha 1 (roughly) can you sit in comfortably and read, write, watch people, and/or chat? Back then, Prague didn’t have much that compared favorably to the coffeehouses in Vienna[1], or even some Starbucks outlet.
Things have seriously changed since then. It started around 2002 with a series of CoffeeHeaven outlets, a Polish coffee and sandwich chain that modeled itself after Starbucks but which had to sell years back all its outlets to London-based Costa Coffee. These days it seems that Costa Coffee has at least one shop on every downtown block. I still have my CoffeeHeaven bonus card, and Costa Coffee honor it, and I feel very smug every time I use it.
Around 2007–8, Starbucks finally invaded Prague with a couple of strategically located outlets and has since added a number of outlets, mostly in downtown. Google Starbucks in Prague. You can have your first SBUX fix at the airport. There are outlets for example at Václavské nám. 40 (corner Štěpánská), Jungmannova 34, Spálená 74/18 (near metro station Národní třída), and a couple of them near Old Town Square and so on. Can’t really miss them. The offerings are standard, as is the coffee and the food-stuff they offer. I have come to appreciate them because many of them are spacious (e.g., second level at Václavské nám. or the yuuuge Jungmannova outlet), they have free and reasonably good wifi (and no one cares whether you sit there for hours and hammer away), and the staff tends to be friendly and know what they are doing. Unfortunately that is often not true for many of the Costa Coffee places which can be claustrophobic, are run by staff that occasionally seems in over its head, and just seem less well-trained and efficient than their SBUX counterparts. That said, the Costa Coffee outlet in the Václavské nám. (“Rokoko”) pasáž remains one of my fav meeting places, increasingly though due to its centrality and short walking distance from my Praha workplace rather than the foodstuff or coffee they offer.
There are, of course, scores of nice stand-alone places (or minor chains such as mamacoffee, about which more in a sec) where you can have a good kava and read, write, chat comfortably, and/or dream. In short, places that fulfil the Rubinstein criterion, i.e., a place “where you can … think!” (I note parenthetically that for Ariel — who drinks strongly watered down instant coffee — it is all about the ambiance, while for me it is about both the environs and the quality of the coffee!)
In the neighborhood where I live (Prague 10, Vršovice), there were — before the pandemic — about a dozen cafes (no less than three within 20 meters of the Ruská tram stop) of which many were quite nice. Unfortunately, half of them have shut down. If you happen to be in my hood, do try this one which happens to pass the Rubinstein test with flying colors. As does this one, just a hundred meters down the road.
But this write-up is about cafes and coffee houses in Praha 1. So there. Talking about places that don’t exist any longer but that nurtured my coffee addiction while living in Prague: a shout-out to now defunct Ebel Coffee House, Kawa Kawa Kawa, and the Tonkin café!
Prague’s is still not quite comparable to the coffee culture that exists in Sydney or Melbourne but getting a good coffee in Prague is no longer the very real problem it was back in May 2000. Tripadvisor, under Restaurants in Prague, subsection Coffee & Tea, currently lists 367 places.
Below are the results of my recent, and very diligent, research in matters kava in Prague 1 (downtown). Suggestions for places I missed, or even dissenting opinions, are always welcome. Send to aortmann@gmail.com, or comment below if you like.
I take responsibility for all errors in judgement.
My current favorites follow presently (places I don’t much like have their own section at the end); note that none of my thirteen recommendations has made it to the top ten in the Tripadvisor ranking of best 10 cafés in Praha 1 (City Center). I am sure that those in the Tripadvisor top ten fail the Rubinstein test (Coffee Places where you can … think!)
Divadelini kavarna, attached to STUDIO DVA DIVADLO, Wenceslas Square 56, nestled away in a pasaz (Fenix palace/Palac Fenix)
Located in a pasaz off Vaclavske namesti but hidden enough to normally not being discovered by tourists, this has been one of my favorites for years.
You can sit inside and outside (in the pasaz that is), they offer coffee and wine and some fine food stuff such as omelettes, pancakes, hommos and avocado sandwiches, cheesecake with raspberry sauce, chocolate curd cake, etc.
A great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee, or a glass of wine for that matter. Note the pictures on the wall — portraits of less or more famous Czech actors. Don’t be surprised if you see one of these folks at the table next to you. That’s because this is the place where the actors go, after the show and before, and before and after practices at the attached divadlo, too.
The restaurant/kavarna is open from 9:00 am to 23:00 on weekdays and at 11:00 on weekends or holidays; breakfast is served until 11 only. So no omelettes on the weekend. Shucks because their omelettes are to die for.
They do have free wifi.
I can’t find them on Tripadvisor or Facebook.
Warning: There’s a bunch of divadelini kavarnas out there, so make sure you go to right one.
Monkey Coffee House Opletalova 922/8 Praha 1 (and also Pod Harfou 995/23)
A somewhat Spartan coffee house although they also have wine on offer. They (and I’m talking about the Opletalova site which opened early in 2023) have some sweet stuff (brownies, banana bread, impressive croissants) but various kinds of excellent coffees (including hand brews) and it’s a great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee.
The Opletalova site opens at 8 am and closes at 6 pm, all week including weekends (as of now) when they currently start at 10 am.
They do have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook although most of the pictures there are for the Pod Harfou site for now. They are on Instagram, too. My Tripadvisor review is here.
Bonus: Across the street from them is a place that offers a well-stocked assortment of Italian food imports, from coffee capsules, to chocolate, to grappa, and vino. Also, a few meters to the right there’s a cafe with lots of fabulous cakes etc. and next to that is a bakery with incredibly good bread.
Cafe Academia Vaclavske Namesti 792/34
This is in the middle of the city and Tourist Central. But you won’t know because the cafe is clearly frequented mostly by locals, last but not least (older) ladies reading in the books from the bookstore. ;-)
The cafe is nestled away on the second floor, in the back, of the Academia bookstore (which in fact is where you find the academic books). The coffee is surprisingly good. (Not quite of Monkey Coffee House quality but then what is ?!) They also have some sweet and tempting stuff (and even a cheese or ham&cheese toast, with salad) and a few house wines, in case you want to ease into winetime. ;-)
The bookstore of which the cafe is a part of is large and one of the better ones in Prague. (They have a sizable section of English language books downstairs.)
While the cafe is quite nice — real flowers and comfy chairs and all, with service that has some upside potential— , there is also balcony overlooking Václavské náměstí on the other side of the second floor. Great view!
They are open from 9–19:30 on weekdays and 10–18:30/17:30 on weekends.
They do not have free wifi but my eduroam connected automatically and just fine. (There is also free wifi in much of downtown Prague, so you should be able to log in from pretty much everywhere.)
You can find the Academia cafe on Tripadvisor and Facebook. They are on Instagram, too.
Spell Jindřišská 939/20, nestled away in a yard, entrance next to the (awful) Green Tomato restaurant, and attached to a hair studio
You can sit inside and outside, they offer coffee (not bad, but not of Monkey Coffee House quality) and some sweet stuff including a bowl with tvarok and fruit that is excellent. They have wine, too.
Another great place to have conversations while sipping a coffee, or a glass of wine or two.
They are open from 7:00 am to 20:00 on weekdays and open at 8:00 and 10:00 on weekends when they close earlier (14:00 and 18:00 it seems).
They do have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook and also Instagram.
The Barrister café and winebar (Kavárna | Vinárna) Štěpánská 629/59 (across the street from the Alcron Hotel, a few metres down the street, literally a stone’s throw away from Wenceslas Square)
A wide and stylish space, where you can sit and read and write. And have conversations. And where you can segue from coffee time to wine time without having to change the location. What’s not to like?
The coffee is good, as are the wine offerings. They do have some sweets, and a couple of other food offerings. Their menu is here. For downtown Prague the prices are reasonable.
The service is friendly and professional, mostly.
Open every weekday 8:00 to 22:00 and during the vikend from 9:00 to 22:00 and 13:00, respectively.
They have free wifi.
You can find them on Instagram here and on Facebook here (mostly in Czech though). The do have a (claimed) Tripadvisor page but there are no reviews yet as of 26 June 2025. Give it a try!
Sicily café Senovážné nám. 994/2 Praha 1
It is both a kavarna and restaurant. You can find their offerings here (in Czech and English); lots of nice stuff (lots of veg(etari)an options).
It’s a good place to work, shoot the breeze, or have conversations although it does get quite crowded around lunch time, so if you like to work there, it is best to go there in off-peak hours.
They open at 8:30 on weekdays and 9:30 on the weekend and close at 22:00 (except Sunday when they close at 21:00).
Breakfast weekdays until 12:00 and weekends all day.
They have free wifi although “sometimes it don’t work” as a waitress (who clearly could not care less) informed me on a recent outing.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook. My 2016 Tripadvisor review is here.
Mama café Vodičkova 10 Praha 1 (about 5 minutes leisurely walk from Václavské náměstí, follow the tram tracks)
It’s part of a chain that has other branches in Prahe 2, 3, 4, and Praha 7. There is apparently another related café in Praha 1 (Café NEZISK at Pohořelec 2). A trust-worthy informant tells me that the Vinohrady (also Praha 2) site is even better than the Vodičkova site.
The Vodičkova site is both a kavarna and restaurant that has daily menus of brekkie (scrambled eggs, curd pancakes, granola), various hummus related dishes (e.g., hummus with pita, hummus bowl, mezze plate), and sandwiches (e.g with egg spread or green pea spread); lots of veg(etari)an options. You can substitute the pita with veggie sticks if you so desire. Plus plenty of sweet stuff (cakes!) of tempting quality. You can find their offerings here (in Czech and English and several other languages). The food is really quite good and relatively inexpensive. Say, simple scrambled eggs are 165 koruns and come with a lovely serving of coleslaw, or some other salad du jour. The espresso is on the bitter side for my taste; the latte, even if strong, is on the weak side.
It’s a great place to work though, shoot the breeze, or have conversations although it does get quite crowded quickly (e.g., on a recent Saturday morning at 10 a.m. all seats were occupied), so if you like to work there, it is best to go there in off-peak hours.
They open at 8:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on the weekend and close at 22:00 (except weekends when they close at 20:00). Service tends to be exceptionally nice.
They do have free wifi (and it works best on the upper floor which is also much more spacious than the ground floor.)
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook.
Prague Bakeshop Kozi 1
This place existed when I moved to Prague in 2000. It was under different ownership then and has been a bit modernized but it is basically the same configuration and many of the same goodies and the same coffee cups etc.
It’s not a place where you could work; too crowded especially during peak hours. (Beware of pocket thiefs then in particular.) The saving grace are the wooden benches outside. In fact, that’s where you find me many Saturday and Sunday mornings. That’s because it’s the best place in downtown Prague to get a good coffee at 7 a.m. every day of the week. (Yes, that includes Saturdays and Sundays.) Plus, the area in which the Prague Bakeshop is located (very very close to Old Town Square), is absolutely peaceful and gorgeous that early in the morning. (Well, mostly, if you can ignore the drunkards, and shady characters, that spill out of the bars across the street. Most of them are fun to watch.)
A great way to start the day. In fact, I can’t think of a much better way to start it. Try their croissants, dorty (cakes), kolaces (tarts, tortes, pies), sandwiches, or quiches. Or their coffee (which for my taste is on the weak side but drinkable).
Open every day 7–21.
They now have (free) wifi. Took them a long time to get there! (Pro-tip: It sometimes does not work but outside you can log into the free wifi of the James Dean club across the street.)
You can study their menu here, in both Czech and English.
You can find them on Tripadvisor and Facebook. My 2018 Tripadvisor review is here.
Head Shot Coffee Palackého 720/5, located in the Franciscan Gardens, in the corner furthest away from the entrances
A fairly small space with a lovely outside, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It’s not the kind of place that a tourist would easily find; it seems indeed frequented by locals mostly.
HSC offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of deliciously looking cakes etc. A few sandwiches and hummus, too.
Open every week day from 8:00 to 19:30. Saturdays and Sunday they are currently open from 10:00 to 18:00.
They have free wifi.
You can find them on Tripadvisor, and Facebook and Instagram.
Café Truhlárna Františkánská zahrada, Jungmannovo nám. 751/19 (when you enter the Gardens from Jungmanova namesti, 50 meters to the left)
A fairly small space with a lovely outside, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It’s not the kind of place that a tourist would easily find but they do occasionally, although the Truhlarna folks advertise themselves and their wares on a blackboard outside in Czech only; it seems frequented by locals mostly.
The cafe offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of deliciously looking cakes etc. A few sandwiches, too. Very friendly staff.
Open every day except Sunday from 8:30 to 20:00 except for Saturday and Sunday when they start at 10:00.
They have free wifi and their network is called zahrahda; password is posted at the counter.
You can find them on Tripadvisor, and Facebook and Instagram.
Goodlok café Jungmannovo namEsti 18 (next to the entrance to Francescan Gardens, near the SBUX on Jungmannovo namEsti)
A wide open space, where you can sit and write. And have conversations. Although I suspect, it being in Tourist Central neighborhood, the staff would not look at you too kindly if you sit there for hours at a time. Or for that matter, potential visitors.
Goodlok offers various kinds of coffee and an inviting selection of fruit juices and kombuchas. They also have omelettes (very good indeed, I had), kimchi-toasts, and other offerings. Food is served until 15:00 Personnel is friendly.
Open every weekday 8:00 to 18:00; not open on weekends it seems.
They have free wifi.
You can study their menu here, in Czech.
You can find them on Tripadvisor (two sites! here and here, few reviews but raves all the same), and Instagram.
Kavarna Adria formally, Národní 40, but adjacent to Jungmannovo namEsti (on the second floor of the massive Palác Adria building)
This is an amazing space (including a very large terrasse), where you can sit and write. And have conversations. It is still to some extent Tourist Central neighborhood (last but not least since the place is written up in many a tourist guide), alas … my experiences have been mostly good. But then I rarely get anything complicated. Mostly caffe lattes (strong) or double espressos, occasionally the cheese omelette, very occasionally a poppy seed cake, etc. I should mention that the dozen or so cakes Adria has on offer are superb and if you are sweet-tooth, you definitely want to try a couple at least.
Service runs the gamut and I am not surprised to see service on Tripadvisor rated a dismal 3.5. With some reporting pretty bad experiences.
Open weekdays 8:00 to 23:00, and weekends from 9:00 to 22:00.
They have free wifi.
You can study their (lunch) menu here, in Czech and English.
Coffee Cube Black Jungmannovo nám. 6/767 (Thanks, Michael!)
Fantova kavarna Wilsonova 300/8
Tynska Literarni Kavarna Tynska 630/6
Kavarna Kampus Hybernská Hybernská 4 (Thanks, Sebastian!)
Super Tramp Coffee Opatovická 160 (Thanks, Elisaveta!)
Liliová (Choco Café) Liliová 250/4 (Thanks, Adela!)
So these are my favorite places right now, most of them not well-known but I am confident you will not be disappointed. There are many more well-known cafes and coffeehouses in Prague such as Café Louvre (not bad actually but failing the Rubinstein test), Café Slavia, Café Savoy (all on the tram 22 line, within a kilometer), Cerna Madona/Grand Café Orient, BISTRO, Café Boulevard (currently an astonishing 1.5 on Tripadvisor! Avoid!), etc.
[1] As Lenka Reinerova — may she rest in peace — put it, “Where, so I ask myself often when I wander through my Prague, have all the coffeehouses gone; those coffeehouses where, over a cup of good black coffee, you could spend much of the day discussing, making plans, hearing the latest gossip, watching — or getting to know — interesting people, making friends, or even falling in love.” (Das Traumcafé einer Pragerin [my café in the sky, 1996; my translation.)

For all those that did not have the opportunity to attend this great event last Thursday (on the 27th of April), reading this post will help you get a nice overview of the experience. For those lucky ones that did attend, it will be a nice reminder (and a mental confirmation that you need to also be there next year!).
Of course, huge congratulations and many thanks to the Neklo team that organised this Meet Magento event. Apart from having planned all the details, different members of their Team were available to help with anything.
Approximately 200 people from many different countries gathered in the same place to attend the 2nd Meet Magento Prague. Although I did not expect this, the event was a truly international one, as I met people from US, UK, Poland, India, Dubai and Italy (and I am missing some countries for sure, as I did not have the opportunity to meet all people). As Igor nicely put it:
This is not a CZ-focused Magento event but rather the gathering of the international Meet Magento community in Prague (Igor Bondarenko, Neklo)
Lot of great content in the 21 Talks from experienced speakers on topics ranging from Magento development and tactics to grow an ecommerce store to insights from a scaling startup and the keynote from the Director of Zoo Prague.
Last, but not least, many litres of beer at the afterparty, as you can clearly see :)
As Thomas Goletz has shared this was the first Meet Magento event presented at a big and luxurious cinema hall! To be honest, for me this was also a 1st as I have never attended another event at a cinema hall. And what an experience this was!
There are 3 reasons why a cinema hall is perfect for such an event, namely acoustics, visuals and comfort. In respect to the visuals, I can just say that these were some great, big, high-quality screens (that you could also play video-games on!, as you can see in the tweets below). Lastly, the seats were absolutely great and comfortable, something that you are not getting in business events.
After the event, there were buses waiting to take us to the afterparty venue where there was a live band playing music, great food and lots of alcohol. What else can you ask for?
As I already mentioned there were 21 Talks, organises in 2 tracks (business, technical) from some inspiring, international speakers. The event had a really good flow with a nice cohesion between the Talks, that were organised on the various sessions by theme.
Following I am sharing my view on some of the Talks I listened to. Although I would love to have attended all Talks, I did not. And this was for a great reason, which is to get to know and communicate with amazing people from different places. Every attendee I met had something interesting to share either from one of the Talks or from their own experience.
The 1st Talk in the event agenda was planned for Thomas Goletz, the founder of Meet Magento Association. Unfortunately Thomas was not able to come, but he had recorded a video that we watched, showing his deep commitment to all the Events. Moreover, Lydia from the MMA Team was there and presented all the great things that are done by the Meet Magento Association and how big and impactful our community is.
After Lydia, Ben took the stage to share all the latest updates on Magento. This is not just a speaker, but THE Ben Marks, Magento evangelist and all-star Magento celebrity.
Ben shared the latest data about how big Magento has become, mentioning that Magento Stores sell a combined of $101B each year! Metrics are rising on every dimension be it # of stores, Partners, events or Magento installations (both M1 and M2). Following shared all the updates on M2 and the integration of companies that were acquired and are being integrated on the Magento platform.
The first session ended with a Talk on the insights gained from the growth of the scaling startup, Taxify. Roman briefly shared how the company was founded by a 19yr old boy before joining university and all their progress till now, valued at $80M. Especially interesting were their approach into competing with Uber, a bigger and more well-funded competitor. In short, he insisted on trying to become the best at what you do, not only at a local level but aiming high to become the best in the world!
Filip is a marketing executive from Fujitsu Technology Solutions. His talk focused on the importance of data in order to successfully operate a growing ecommerce business. He mentioned the proliferation of available data and how we can combine them in order to get actionable insights using Big Data technologies.
Lucas’s Talk on their experience from M2 implementations was really clear, data-based and full of insights and this is something that I heard from different people. He shared benchmarks on M1 vs M2 implementations in terms of time needed and current pain points on this process, providing all attendees with a nice framework to think about their next implementation.
5 latest email marketing trends for 2017 (Kristina Pototskaya, Triggmine)
Setting up an ecommerce store is really important, but without lots of relevant traffic one cannot grow. Email marketing is one of the top growth drivers and Kristina shared all the latest trends. The most important learning is that using technology, a store can intelligently segment its email list and send relevant, timely and personalised campaigns that can deliver great ROI.
This is the 2nd time I had the pleasure to see Kristina presenting and what I must day is that she really shares insights and adds value while also making us also laugh with her upbeat style.
Effectively promoting a store with digital advertising is key to ecommerce success. Alex shared his framework for doubling the revenue of a store using Facebook Ads either for retargeting or for prospecting. By growing 30% each dimension (frequency, recency, average value) a store can more than x2 its revenue. This was not theory talk, but really actionable tips!
Miles has vast experience from growing Magento stores using digital marketing. In this Talk, he shared how they are auditing a store in terms of SEO and what are the low-hanging fruits that you can take work on in order to grow your store. (I really loved the carefuly designed, great visuals from this presentation. It was as if they were a best practice example from Presentation Zen book).
Another beautifully designed presentation. Victor talked about impactful design by showing us different techniques and best practices on all the areas of an ecommerce website. While he was talking, it was more than clear that he was speaking from vast experience.
If you reached this far, it is more than sure that you have understood what a great event this was! A truly international event in a great venue with many Talks. I have to say just one thing; see you there next year!
And I would close this post by asking all of us to try to contribute on Magento in order to continue to build such a powerful ecommerce platform. The slide with ways to get involved is from Ben Marks presentation.
Thank you for reading!

“The streets of Prague were a fantasia scarcely touched by the twenty-first century — or the twentieth or nineteenth, for that matter. It was a city of alchemists and dreamers, its medieval cobbles once trod by golems, mystics, invading armies.” — Laini Taylor
The first sttlement of what is now Prague has been traced to the second half of the 9th century. The oldest building was Vyšehrad (“castle”), set on a commanding right bank hill. It was followed by what was to become Hradčany, set on an equally commanding left bank site a little downstream.
The name Prague, also known as Praha in Czech, is believed to originate from an old Slavic word, práh, which means “threshold” or “ford”. This refers to Prague’s location at a crossing point of the Vltava River and possibly to the city’s low-lying areas as a “threshold” to the Prague Castle. Another theory suggests the name comes from the verb “pražit” meaning “to roast” or “to burn,” possibly referring to the practice of removing forest cover by fire.
I think there’s a few cities in the world that have a genuine amount of magic in them, and Prague is definitely one of them. Once known as the nucleus of the Bohemian state Prague exudes it’s rich and complex history through every brick and spire.. I’ll give you an overview of how we spent our two days in this magical city and hopefully it can help with your own trip planning to this incredible destination.
After arriving in the Czech airport it’s very simple to take public transport in the form of a bus to Old Town Square which is like Disney World for history lovers.
The square’s center is home to a statue of religious reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in Konstanz for his beliefs. There are also memorials to the “martyrs” (including Jan Jesenius and Maxmillian Hostalek) who were beheaded on that spot during the Old Town Square execution by Hasburgs after the Battle of White Mountain. Ironically, greater than 70% of the Czech Republic identifies as religiously unaffiliatd with atheism being the most prominent non-religious affiliation.
Since this was the last leg of our honeymoon my husband splurged on the suite looking over the Old Town Square and a direct view of the incredible Astronomical Clock.
Straight out of the Golden Compass the Astronomical Clock (or Prague Orloj) is an icon of the Czech Republic. The clock mechanic, has 3 main cmponents: (1) the astronomical dial, representing the position of the sun and moon; (2) statues of various Catholic saints standing on either side of the clock; (3) “The Walk of the Apostles,” an hourly show of moving apostle figures and other sculptures, notably a figure of a skeleton that represents Death, striking the time, and a calender dial with medallions representing the months.
According to legend, the city will suffer if the clock is neglected and its operation placed in jeopardy.
Prague is known as the “City of a Hundred Spires” (or sometimes “City of 500 Spires”) because of the numerous turrets, towers, and spires that dot the city’s skyline. These spires, found on churches, castles, townhouses, and other historical structures, are a defining feature of Prague’s architectural landscape. The name was popularized by a 19th-century mathematician who counted the spires, and while the exact number has varied over time, the city’s skyline remains iconic for its spires.
We spent our first day just soaking in the amazing sites and history of the city. The city is very walkable and at every turn you can see architecture from a plethora of centuries all coming together to make a uniquely distinct Prague.
You can’t miss the Powder Tower, which is a dramatic 65 meter tall gothic tower built as one of the 13 gates to the city. This monumental entrance was taken by the Czech kings entering into Old Town during their coronation processions. It’s name comes from its former rol as a gunpowder store. A viewing gallery is located at a height of 44 meters providing a dazzling view of Prague.
No trip to Prague is complete without a walk (or 3…or 5) across the Charles Bridge. This bridge is guardd by thirty statues and sculptures of saints representing the great personalities of European and global history, each f whom somehow moved the world and changed it for the better. The spirituality of the saints gives Charles Bridge a mystical aura, a sort of open-air temple enclosed by the bridge towers. The bridge is particularly spectacular at night when the light of the gas lamps sculpts the architectural stone.
To make a wish, you can rub the figure of Jan Nepomuk which has been worn to a fine polish from centuries of previous wishes. For your second wish you will need to head towards the middle of the bridge. Yes you heard that right — this is a BOGO wish bridge situation. On the parapet of the bridge is a bronze statue of a saint with 5 stars around his head. To make a wish, put the finger of your right hand on the 5 stars. In this case, the left hand should be on the legs of Nepomuk. Then you need to step on the gold nail with your right foot. All three of these conditions must be completed for the second wish to come true.
Additionally around the city you can find a plethora of unique shops and markets. I particularly loved all the jewelery and glass stores. Prague, and by extension the Czech Republic, is famous for its glass, particularly Bohemian glass and crystal, due to a long tradition of craftsmanship, high quality, and unique designs.
One of my favorite things about Prague was the people. The hospitality in Italy and so much of Europe is gracious and a little over the top, but being in Prague I felt there was a certain down to earth and straightforward nature that was succinct but polite all at the same time. Being Ukrainian, I felt straight at home.
The food in Prague was absolutely incredible. One of our favorite restaurants was called Mincovna which was the former location of the Prague Mint. Every dish we tried there was incredible but I particularly loved the rabit and dumplings.
Of course, no discussion about Prague would be thorough without commenting on its rich beer culture. Pilsner Urquell is located adjacent to Prague and Straropramen, a major brewery, is a popular tourist destination with a visitor center and tours. The brewery’s history dates back to 1869, and it offers a diverse range of beers, including their flagship Staropramen brand. Prague also has smaller, independent breweries and brewpubs, some of which are listed in other search results.
I’m not a big beer fan but I really enjoyed the beer in Prague. In the Czech Republic, you’ll often encounter beers poured with a significant head of foam, which is considered an important part of the beer’s experience. This style, sometimes referred to as “mlíko,” is intentionally designed to have a thick, creamy head. This foam serves to keep the beer cold, fresh, and even adds a layer of sweetness that balances the beer’s bitterness
I highly recommend getting a good tour of the city since trying all of Pragues tasty treats is easiest with a well equipped guide (and who doesn’t like good company?).
Our food tour guide took us to see a plethora of Prague food classics included open faced sandwiches, which was a personal favorite as a I grew up eating them in my Ukranian family.
My personal favorites on the tour were the enormous (and I mean ENORMOUS) pork hok and pork schnitzel.
Our food tour guide not only covered the food of the city but also it’s history and culture. One particular story I enjoyed was of a Czech christmas food tradition, particularly in Prague, involving a carp. According to her it’s tradition to buy a live carp, bring them home, and keep them in the bathtub until Christmas Eve, sometimes naming them and treating them like pets. The carp is then cooked, often fried and served with potato salad, and is a key part of the Christmas Eve meal.
In my opinion the best evening sweet treat in Prague is the Trdelník. This is a kind of spit cake and variant of Kürtőskalács. It is made from dough that is wrapped around a stick, then baked and topped with sugar and walnut mix and filled with ice cream. Aka — pure ice cream heaven.
In Part 2 of this 2 day trip I’ll cover our second day in Prague which consisted of a bike tour, trip to the modern art museum, and the most incredible library tour. Hope this helped in your own travel plans!

History is impossible to remove from the minds of inhabitants, especially an entire nation’s past. It reminds them of everything they, or those before them, fought for and eventually lost. The hardship and torment can be seen in the very architecture, and if walls could talk, they’d surely cry out. Regular buildings no longer hold their innocence as every physical object takes on a new negative connotation.
Countries like Germany have dealt with this positively, owning up to the war crimes their ancestors committed. The Czech Republic, however, has not.
The capital city of Prague is a metropolis that, despite its newfound cultural optimism, has been beaten down by tyranny and existed under the boot of powers much larger than their own.
Yet, there is a previously unknown demographic of travelers that would be ecstatic to uncover the darker sides of the nation’s history. These individuals travel the world, specifically visiting the strangest and most infamous tourist attractions offered ‒ and sometimes restricted ‒ on the map. Visiting historical sites closely connected to death or tragedy is known as “Dark Tourism.”
Dark tourists get engrossed in the past in the oddest ways possible, whether on a stroll through the highly irradiated city of Chernobyl or a drive past the assassination spot of President John F. Kennedy. When death and tragedy strike, you can be sure, a dark tourist will be there a few hundred years later, Geiger Counter and a digital camera in-hand.
Despite being highly criticized as yet another way to desecrate or exploit a historical area and the dead associated with it, the popularity of Dark Tourism has risen in the last decade.
With the popularization of shows like the Netflix Original “Dark Tourist,” hosted by a New Zealander journalist, David Farrier, a whole new generation of dark tourists have emerged. Those who have seen Farrier’s excursions have witnessed an exponential amount of dark, thrilling, and outright controversial historical sites and experiences.
This is not your family’s average summer trip up to Mount Rushmore. In the show, Farrier meets Pablo Escobar’s charismatic enforcer, Popeye, in Columbia, and is guided through Escobar’s former apartment by the drug lord’s sister-in-law. David then witnesses an exorcism in Mexico and participates in a faux illegal border crossing. That’s just the first episode. Viewers see the danger and the controversy as appealing elements to this strange take on the typical family vacation.
The popularity of dark tourism has brought light to areas otherwise forgotten by society. Along with the extension of tourism, there is a necessity to address these events as something that has indeed happened and impossible to be neglected further. Cue the Czech Republic.
Under the site of what was once a 14,200-ton statue of the international icon of tyranny, Joseph Stalin, lives Prague’s newest and most innovative dark tourism hotspot. Organized by “Post Bellum,” an organization preserving Czech historical memory, this new exhibit opened to touch all recent modern cases of threatened life in the Czech Republic.
The exhibit offers a truly immersive look into Czech oppression of the 20th century. A dark, narrow-gated hallway with the only intruding sunlight from the doorway behind, leads visitors’ way to the viewing room. As the gate stops further down, ominous spotlights greet you.
From there you are thrown straight into a memorable experience filled with artificial gunfire, neon lighting, and even a secret police interrogation similar to those done to political prisoners in the early 1950s. A projector lights up the floor with planes bombing the terrain. The room paints a grim moving picture of Czech Jews being herded into concentration camps, like unsuspecting cattle to the slaughter.
You are then transported into the crypt of St. Cyril and St. Methodius Cathedral, where the paratroopers sent to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, high-ranking German Nazi official, are killed by overwhelming German forces. The room begins flooding and gunfire ricochets off the cement walls. Though only a simulation, the threat of danger seems real.
Dark tourists will immediately be intrigued by the immersive experience of reliving central Europe’s most gruesome moments. However, the purpose of this exhibit is not to purely glorify violence.
The experience is meaningfully disorientating, revealing a fraction of what the country has had to go through to shape itself into how we know it today. It is no coincidence that this exhibit correlates with the 100th anniversary of Czechoslovakia’s establishment, as it was designed to illustrate the long process of cultural identity.
There is a separate portion of the exhibit with an enclosed screening room where you can hear actual testimonials by those who lived in the eras of outright oppression. Jewish concentration camp survivors, former Communist party members, and victims of the vast oppression have all been recorded to give an oral first-person report of what transpired. This puts a face to the chaos and gives you an opportunity to sympathize.
Prague has limited museums covering this era, and none of them offer this intense look into almost a century of oppression and hardship. Presenting this narrative using particular lighting and audio arrangements convey the point well, simultaneously attracting dark tourists. That is what may just normalize the nation’s dark history: a darker form of tourism.

Prague… the jewel of Eastern Europe. I had extremely high hopes and aspirations for this city when I was originally planning my trip; so much so, I had once considered quitting my job and moving here to teach English. However, upon my arrival, I was so enervated and downtrodden that I was afraid I’d never leave the hostel. Suffice it to say that I think I have literally reached the breaking point of my body. Two months of non-stop partying, travelling, sleepless nights in noisy hostels, poor diet and dangerous excursions have beaten me to a pulp. My back feels like that of an 80-year-old man, and my knee gets worse with each passing day. I can barely walk, and stairs prove to be quite a challenge. I have felt sick for over a week now, no doubt the result of some foreign virus or bacteria I ingested with my head on a filthy hostel pillow. But ultimately, I set out on this trip not to complain or be hindered by bodily aches, but to live, learn, and make memories and friends for a lifetime! So enough with the whining… suck it up and get on with the damn blog!
Tim, Kevin and I arrived in Prague after a 9-hour train ride… it was supposed to be a 5-hour ride. Don’t ask me how it ended up so late because I have no clue. It sucked because I hadn’t eaten before I left, and had zero Hungarian or Czech currency on me to grab a bite in the dining car. To make matters worse, once we passed the border into Slovakia, we were approached by the conductor for our tickets. I brandished my Eurail pass, as I had done countless other times, but in this case, the man said in broken English “no good in Slovakia!” You have got to be kidding me. This douchebag is yelling that my rail pass isn’t valid in his country and I had to buy another ticket to just pass through! When I told him I had no cash, and learned he didn’t accept credit, he threatened to kick me off the train at the next stop. Luckily Tim and Kevin were able to pull together just enough change for me to stay on board, for which I am super thankful because when we finally saw the next town, it looked like that scene in Eurotrip when they arrive in Eastern Europe and it’s a cold war era ghost town. I highly doubt an ATM existed there.
We arrived into Prague, grabbed a quick lunch together, and then I set out hobbling about for a solid hour to find my hostel. A cab would have been nice, but I still didn’t have any cash. I checked in and set about meeting new people at the bar, and finally indulge in Czech beers, purported to be the best in the world. It was too late to explore the city, so I might as well explore these fine pilsner brews! I must admit, they are delicious, and certainly on par with the German lagers, but I’m sorry Czech Republic… nothing will ever beat the Belgian beers. They continue to reign supreme. I caught a healthy buzz, but was strangely exhausted from the train ride, even though I just sat there doing nothing the entire afternoon. I plopped into my bed, but was granted very little sleep due to my room being as hot as a sauna. There was a heat wave tearing through Prague this particular week, and this hostel (despite being rated the best in the city) had no AC. Fantastic.
The next morning, I set out to explore and learn about the city. Prague is positively gorgeous, with a massively winding river in the center, the biggest castle in Europe placed upon a hill in the background (every successive king would add a new section to it over the millennia, and it now consists of dozens of architecture types, from Gothic to Nouveau to Victorian…very cool), and houses of every color imaginable. It seems that at the fall of Communism, the people could not wait to paint their bleak and monotonous homes in vivid yellows, greens, reds, and blues… a veritable Easter basket of tones!
Another striking feature of this city, which is in stark contrast to say Budapest, is how old it truly is. While Budapest, Munich, and some other cities were ravaged by war and rebuilt to appear old, Prague survived the onslaught relatively unscathed. And there are two reasons why; one is a tale of heroism and triumph, the other purely sinister…
Hitler loved Prague and considered it a true gem of a city. When the Nazis came in and started deporting all of the Jews to death camps, he did something he did not do in other cities. As opposed to razing all of the Jewish edifices, as he had done in other cities, he chose to leave them standing. The reason being that after he had completed the eradication of an entire race, he would set up the Jewish quarter of Prague as a sort of museum: a testament to a destroyed group of people. As a result of this sick bastard’s intentions, the Jewish district is oddly well preserved, and thus very beautiful. In fact, the oldest still-functioning Jewish temple resides here, and is actually comprised of bricks from the original Solomon’s temple in Israel.
The other reason for Prague’s survival was the Citizen Uprising, an amazing story of a small group of people revolting against the brutal Nazis. At the very end of the war, the people were so angry at the Nazis, they wanted to fight back and show that they would not tolerate any more injustices. When Patton and his American regiments were within 60 miles of the city, the people took to the streets with whatever weapons they could fashion (pots and pans, broomsticks, bricks, etc.) and starting beating the Nazis to death, despite overwhelming losses due to Nazi machine guns. The hope was that the Americans would soon arrive and support them. However, unknown to them, the agreement between the US and the Soviets had Prague just east of the demarcation line, and thus Patton was unable to advance any farther. Knowing this, the Nazis began to furiously fight back. But then an odd thing happened; Nazis started shooting other Nazis! These were in fact Russians who had defected to Germany to fight with the Nazis, for they thought that Hitler was the lesser of two evils when compared to Stalin. These defectors, knowing the Red Army was only two days away, decided it would be better to surrender to the Americans rather than be executed by their former countrymen. The Nazis were confused as to who to fight, so they retreated, but began to burn the city down. Knowing that the Americans and Soviets were both pushing forward, they decided it might be in their best interest to regroup to protect Berlin. The Prague citizens, watching their great city begin to burn, did an interesting thing: they proposed a truce to the Nazis. If the Nazis would leave, without destroying another building, the citizens would not fire upon them. And so it was… the Nazis left, and the people rejoiced!… for a whopping two days. When the Soviets arrived, they took credit for the expulsion of the Nazis, and until 1989 when Communism crumbled, no one knew this amazing tale of how 30,000 Prague citizens fought off over a million Nazis. Amazing.
After my history lesson, I prepared to head out on the Prague Underground, supposedly the best pub crawl in all of Europe. But it started to pour, so I called it an early night. The next afternoon, I met up with Cammy (Florence), Sarah (Budapest), Kevin (Nice), and Chris (Corfu), and we set out on the pub crawl. The first bar was jam packed, but for 90 minutes, it was unlimited beer, wine, and shots of vodka/rum. We descended upon the bar with a vendetta; I think I was able to stomach about 12 shots and 10 beers before the heat became unbearable. At one point, I pleaded with the bartender to blast me with the cocktail gun; he obliged and soaked me in a stream of soda water… and everyone behind me! I was now dripping wet, but hammered and happy!
We continued on to bar after bar, until ultimately along the walk I realized I had to profusely urinate. I ran down into a metro stop, but was instantly dismayed to see that it had been locked up for the night. I hobbled back up to the streets to find an open store that may allow me to use their bathroom, but everything was closed. I turned the corner and walked down an alley looking for another bar, but I hit a dead end. When I headed back the way I came, I was shocked to see that someone had come along and trapped me inside this alley! A huge metal gate was stretched across the doorway, and there was no way out! I tried ripping it open, knocking on doors and windows, and screaming for the culprit who had locked me in, all to no avail. Great… let’s climb this here 12-foot wall on a torn knee ligament.
Just as I crested over the other side, I lost my grip and plummeted straight onto the concrete. As I lay cursing this gate prankster, an elderly woman came shuffling over to me. Oh how pleasant, a local is coming to my aid! What she had to say next was the most disturbing/hilarious thing I had heard in weeks! “Oh my, you have big fall! You are big boy! Here I help you up. You ok? Yes? Good! You want blowjob for 600 koruna??” ($30 US dollars) She made a move to grab my groin, and I instantly started laughing my ass off! This woman was the same age as my grandmother. Through hysterical laughter, I thanked her for her offer, but all I needed was a bathroom. I limped off cracking up to rejoin my group.
The girls went home early, but Kevin, Chris and I stayed to hit up the last spot on the pub crawl. It’s a massive club on the top floor of a 20-story building, accessed by elevator, affording an amazing view of Wenceslas Square, Prague’s central square steeped in history. I was having fun dancing under the massive crystal disco ball, but it was getting late and we were all running out of money. We cabbed it home and crashed.
The next day, Chris and I went in search of a supposed beer garden, but were disappointed to find a small café in some park. Beer garden my ass. Nevertheless, we sipped on some lagers and hung out all afternoon in the newfound coolness that had descended over the city. I headed off to grab dinner, and met up with everyone again later on at the hostel. We were all pretty beat from the pub crawl the night before, and since I wanted to be fresh for Berlin the next day, we decided to have a chill night (oh how wrong would I be in the end of this disaster). We headed over the river via metro to a local movie theater. The girls went and saw some more of that Twilight garbage, and Chris and I caught the new Predators movie, completely dubbed in Czech.
After the movies, we were supposed to meet in the lobby and head home together, but the girls were nowhere to be found. It was roughly 11:45 pm, so we walked all over this megaplex looking for them. Yep, they left us. After spending 20 minutes looking for them, we headed to the metro, but learned we had missed the last train of the day by five minutes! We had to head back up to the streets, and walk over the bridge to the other side of the river to catch a tram… in the now pouring rain. Upon arrival, we learned our usual tram had also stopped running, so we had to make an educated guess as to which of the night trams went past our hostel. We guessed very wrong, as after 20 minutes, we ended up in the Prague projects at the very last stop on the southeast part of town, at which point the tram driver kicked us out into the rain. Bewildered, defeated, and moody, we had to wait 45 minutes for another to come along. We figured we had just taken this tram in the wrong direction, since we both had an inclination that this was indeed the correct line. Finally, the tram arrived, and we rode it… all the way to the other end point on the complete other northwest side of town without finding our stop! Angered, we started asking everyone we could, but suddenly no one spoke English. We now realized we had to get on another line, so we rode this damn tram again in the southeast direction, but got off to catch a connecting train which we hoped was going in the right direction. It paid off because we finally found the hostel… after literally seeing the entire city! We left that movie theater at midnight; we arrived at our hostel at 3:20 am.
Long story short, I got four hours of sleep… again! Now I’m on the train to Berlin, my last real destination before heading back to Amsterdam for a single night before catching my flight home and ending this odyssey. I am quite conflicted at this point; I’d love to keep travelling indefinitely, but I can feel my body can’t go much further. I’m excited to go home and see everyone, to have ice cold beer, to lie in my bed with the History channel lulling me to sleep (as opposed to 12 drunks in my hostel room), to lift weights, to drive my car or make a call on my cell phone. I have four days left, but you can be assured I will make the best of them! Besides, my next hostel has a pool on the roof!

The mix of design, business and IT was very welcome. I learned most from talks outside my own area of expertise. That’s also what attracts me in interaction design: talking with clients and users, and learning new things from different subjects. I talked with everybody in the conference, from the speakers to the guy making the tea. The conference had a very open and relaxed atmosphere and there were several cool things besides the talks such as: 3d printing, Google Glass, and even a professional masseur. Another neat idea was the discomfort zone, where people were allowed to debate freely and play devils advocate without consequences. Also great were the after-conference parties and events. Sadly, the design workshop on Thursday didn’t happen due to lack of attendees.
The quality of the talks was very good overall. But it seemed that every design or business presentation has lists of “ideas”, “key takeaways”, “guidelines” or “insights’. A lot of them seemed trivial or made up on the spot (“listen to your users”, really?). It would have been better for most talks to stick to one message! Now, I’ll break that rule straight away and present some take-aways :)
Marli Mesbov gave a great presentation on the importance of story telling. Stories work better than short tag lines, which is probably related to Key Take Away 1 (no take-aways).
Stories work for conversion and for your clients to positively remember you. Do you remember the fairytale of the boy who cried wolf? Don’t you think that carries the message better than “don’t alarm us for nothing”? The average attention span went down from 12 seconds in 2000 to a mere 8 seconds in 2012, so better make your story captivating!
Besides working on your site, stories also work great for doing design. It’s an old saying, but still good advice: instead of designing for users, design for a story.
Lastly, a story can be used to instruct a client on how to use the website. Instead of delivering a 100 page styleguide which people don’t read, you can make a short story, a trailer or just a word (“dictionary”, “phonebook”), which ‘explains’ the site to the client.
It was great to hear some self-conscious critique on terms we use within the field. Our terms are confusing and their meaning differs per person and company: UX, service design and even interaction design (but less). Some people include visual design in there, programming, marketing… All very confusing! And what to think of terms like ‘expert’ or ‘guru’? Instead, it’s better to describe what you do and how it benefits the client or project.
Bad user experience costs money, which is what we tell our clients also But it was great to see some examples, such as Expedia losing 12 million dollar because of a form field or Best Buy losing 300 million dollar by requiring an unnecessary login. This holds especially for mobile use: a lot of apps are used only once or thrown away within a month. Avi Itzkovitch had some nice examples how to overcome such bad experience by making more use of context. For instance by adapting the interface based on location, time of day or usage pattern.
I wish it could be a wholehearted yes! I had a lot of fun, met great people and learned a lot, but… Some things nagged a bit, like the cancelled design workshop, the open doors in some design talks and the endless lists of recommendations. Another thing is the overlap in the program: breaks were different for each track making it difficult to switch. That might be why designers mostly went to the design track and programmers to the development tracks, making the mingling a lot less. On top of that, all speakers were “safe choices”, nobody went really overboard or crazy with some thought-provoking talk. Still, it was fun and I learned useful things, so, I guess it’s four out of five stars. For a visual impression, see the Facebook photostream
Webexpo puts the talks online (very slowly), so which ones should you see?

I’ve been to Prague several times, for both professional and personal reasons. My last visit was just last week. Over the years, I’ve seen how overtourism has taken its toll on the city—especially with crowds of loud, drunken young tourists. But this time, for some reason, the streets were much quieter, with only a few visitors around. For the first time, I felt like I could truly see the city.

Anthony Bourdain had an uncanny ability to portray the essence of a place. His introductory monologues were so freaking inspiring and something I’ll forever attempt to emulate. How the hell can you capture the energy of a city in words?
They’re such unique, ever-changing, and living expressions of society, culture, and time. And they all feel different. San Fransisco is not Paris which is not Kuala Lumpur or Beijing or Casablanca. Each has its own vibe that emanates from the shape and warmth of its street lights, the hush of the tide, the signs in the shop windows, the tables in the plazas, the smell wafting from restaurants or street vendors, the hum of scooters, the ringing of bicycle bells, the billboards, and the different eras of architecture that show the decades and centuries stacked over each other.
It is much easier to get all that with the audio and visuals of film. To express it all with words alone is a tall task.
But it is something I’ve been thinking about undertaking. Could I ever begin to do Prague justice? No, but I can try.
What is it like to live here in 2022?

November 22, or something like that.
Lovely cafe in which I do not know the name,next to another European clock towerand a bell that strikes upon the hourtick tick ticking away the seconds that make upEvy and I drinking lattes and eating cakes in a foreign place.
Wandering along the slippery cobblestone path, an indulgence, a tiresome dancebetween coffee and beer and long mornings sleeping withthe cold aircoming in through the window.
This place has decorative tiles, imperfect concrete walls supporting high ceilingsabstract paintings for the contemplation of the consumerthe ponderings of an American who can’t sit still obsessing over the future,reading Eckhart Tolle to cease the dwell.
Is it possible, to be all that I wish to beto live out the stories I tellin my mind, the visions of a lifeexisting in a raindrop of time.
Tis a compulsion to live almost exclusivelythrough memory and anticipation.

Two perfect days in April: my book launches in Prague and the Netherlands,https://medium.com/@Eline_Vedder/two-perfect-days-in-april-my-book-launches-in-prague-and-the-netherlands-8316595dd293,"Sign up

When the audience gets involved: events, interviews, videos, and book talk
In this article, I will cover two perfect days in April. 12 April: Book launch in Diemen, the Netherlands. 26 April: book launch in Prague.
It was the perfect day for my book launch; the cherry blossoms bloomed. Spring was palpable. The book signing took place at the local bookstore. We arranged coffee, cakes with the book cover on them, balloons, my lucky pencil, and of course, the books.
The local newspaper announced the signing. Read it here (it’s in Dutch). The article is about the book and my reason for writing it, my choice of leaving Amsterdam to move to Prague, traveling, writing in English, and daydreaming.
“I knew early on that I didn’t want to stay in the place I grew up and knew well.I wanted to gain new impressions and reinvent myself.” — Eline Vedder
Friends and family were there, and people I had not seen for eight years. They had read it in the newspaper. They bought the novel with them or brought it from the bookstore. I signed their copies and added a personal note. Something I knew they would like in the book, something that would resonate with them.
Strangers visited the store, too. Some passed the store and were curious. I told them about Nora’s story (the main character in Sitting Next to a Stranger) and my love for writing. We talked about books, traveling, self-publishing, creating art, and following your dreams.
Check the reel below:

A post shared by @eline.vedder
How books surprise usWhen I started writing the book, I thought it was about meeting strangers and summarizing the lessons we learn from each other. The book surprised me when I wrote it. It turned out to be about strangers, but more so, about finding a connection, friendship, and love. About art, traveling, and stepping away from your protective upbringing. About getting into the beautiful world. About daring to leave. Your place, your relationship, your old self. It’s about removing the labels you put on yourself. The characters in the book taught me everything I needed to know about these topics.
I still have to get used to the idea that my book stands on people’s shelves. People will enter the world I wrote down and go on a journey with my characters. I’m curious to hear what the readers will pick up from the book. Which topics and lessons will stand out for them? What will they find in the story?
“Like Nora, I used to go to the Museum Square and look at the Van Gogh Museum. I drew some of my first paintings there.”
“My son lives and works in Guatemala. I will give him Sitting Next to a Stranger once I finish.”
“I am an anthropologist and have traveled through Mexico. Can’t wait to see how you fictionalized this country.”
Saturday 26th April. 16.00/4 pm. Prague — I enter a calm garden in the city center. The sky is blue, and the weather is perfect after four days of rain. I place three journals on display. They are the original manuscript of my just-published novel, Sitting Next to a Stranger. I am setting up a small exhibition while I wait for my nerves to calm down and for the guests to arrive.
16.59/4.59 pm — My friends Gabriele, Andrew, Miko, and Cortney transformed the garden into a magical place. They hang all the balloons and posters and put everything in the perfect spot. They tell me that it’s going to be fine.
“It will all go smoothly, you can enjoy your achievement,” they all say in their own words.
“OK, I think you’re right,” I reply. My voice is quivering, and my eyes scan the garden. I realize how perfect it is, how grateful I am that we can make this day happen. How important it is to celebrate creative endeavors. The sun warms my face, and I start to believe it: I can do this, I’m the author. I know my novel, and I can answer every question. I trust my art and myself.
I run to the tables on the terrace. The people don’t know anything about this event. “Hey,” I say. “I’m celebrating my book. We don’t know each other, but you are invited.” They wish me good luck and adjust their seats so they can see what we are about to start. We are about to start the most magical three hours. This event is all I dreamed of. I’m still flabbergasted that I pulled this off, but I have envisioned this for the last three years. Is this manifesting?
Text continues
“I met you three years ago, when you told me you wanted to write a book. I’m so happy I can be part of this celebration.”
“I love the cover, the title is catchy.”
“I don’t read a lot, but my girlfriend does. She will love this book.”
“I’m lost in life, I need to figure out what I want.”
I reply: “This is the perfect moment for you to read this book. It won’t answer your question of where to go in your life, but it will make you gentle with yourself.”
“I have been to Mexico too, I can’t wait to ‘travel’ back to it.”
“I need something lighthearted.”
“I heard your interview, I want to read Nora’s story.”
You can find the full 36-minute Q&A on YouTube. Read the questions and my answers in my other Substack post.
My biggest takeaways from these events:
Writing is, first and foremost, something I do for myself. I want to spend my days thinking about scenes, characters, and books. I wrote this book because I had to; I wrote it for my 21-year-old self. The best mindspace was when I wasn’t even sure if I’d publish it.
Now, the audience is involved, and my book is out in the world. It’s there for you. Be surprised and have fun on this trip in Mexico and within yourself.
I’m always down for a book chat!
Thank you to everyone who showed up 💙✨
📚Sitting Next to a Stranger is out now! Here on Amazon.
With Love,

Moo Downtown, https://www.mooo-apartments.com/downtown/en/
Getting from the airport to the city centre is very simple; there is a bus (number 119) outside the terminal that takes you to the nearest Metro station (Nádraží Veleslavín) from which you can ride the line six stops to the centre of the city. This can all be done on the same travel ticket which can be purchased at the bus stop using your bank card or Apple/Android Pay for a few pounds.
The city has a fantastic transport system comprising of retro and modern trams which always seem to be around when you need them; a cool and efficient Metro system fitted out with a Soviet-era feel; buses; and even a funicular railway line.
A single ticket can be used on all modes of transport, for the amount of time purchased.
Card or coins are accepted. Simply stamp your ticket when first entering the system.
The city also has a rising number of e-scooters and e-bikes which can be hired using the various apps on your phone.
The best way to get a bearing of the city is to start in its centre.
The Old Town Square is filled with grand architectural masterpieces, host to fancy restaurants, and free museums. The famous Astronomical Clock is located in the square and is the oldest clock in the world still in operation. The square is also host to two large and lofty churches — the Church of Our Lady before Týn, and St. Nicholas’ Church. Be sure to look up and admire the ceiling frescos, and ask staff for the times of the next free choir performances!
A short walk from the Old Town Square is Wenceslas Square, a half-mile long, 14th-century street crowned with the Czech Republic’s National Museum, shops and hotels. The Metro line runs underneath the street enabling quick access to either end and transport beyond. The National Museum currently includes exhibitions on the city’s role in defying Nazi rule during WW2, a fabulous light show that adapts according to classical music, and an elaborate collection of natural history from angler-fish to grizzly bears. The building itself is a fantastic classical-style structure with a spectacular fountain and a commanding view of the street. Entry is not free but is under £10.
North of the city centre is the Jewish Quarter comprised of six different locations to explore and learn about including an amazing 15th-century cemetery, multiple synagogues and museum displays narrating the Jewish story of Prague. Entry is not free, but under £15 for full access.
Lunch: Bistro Monk, a laid-back eatery with an outdoor terrace, serving all-day breakfasts, pancakes & burgers.
Dinner: San Carlo Dittrichova, a small but characterful Italian restaurant with underground and outdoor seating (and very good pricing!)
Perhaps Prague’s most famous tourist spot is the 14th-century Charles Bridge which stretches over the Vltava river that runs through the city.
Crossing the bridge from the city centre will take you towards Prague Castle and its accompanying St. Vitus Cathedral which dominates the skyline. While you can walk to the castle, it is easier to get the tram since you have to walk up a long flight of steps to get to the top of the hill on which the castle resides. Entry is not free but low-priced, and this gives you access to the whole Cathedral and multiple rooms of the castle, as well as a fantastic old street made up of tightly packed houses which are host to shops, an armour museum, torture chambers and medieval rooms. There are multiple cafes to eat at around the castle complex, uniformed soldiers manning outposts for a great photo opportunity, and stunning city views from the beautiful green gardens.
For an exciting late afternoon, try renting a peddle or rowing boat from one of the small islands on the Vltava river. The island housing the Žofín Palace is a popular spot to sit by the river in the evening or hire a boat. A map of the boating area is provided and a lifeboat watches over. The normal renting period is an hour and is not expensive with boats of varying sizes available. The experience is particularly mesmerising at sunset with the sky turning a deep blue as the buildings begin to be lit up by their mesmerising golden lights. Look out for the otters swimming around!
Dinner: Bistro Špejle, a modern buffet-style restaurant that provides numerous small tapas-like dishes and lovely desserts. There is a very wide selection of drinks and the pricing system is based on the number of cocktail sticks on each dish.
The role played by Prague during WW2 is perhaps best remembered through Operation Anthropoid (1942). Start your day by visiting St Cyril and Methodius church crypt in which the brave men who fought against Nazi rule hid inside before facing a fateful stand-off in the crypt with Nazi soldiers. There is a new but small museum that documents the story of the brave men involved and Prague’s WW2 history. Access is free, but given the nature of the topic, it is a moving location to visit.
From the church, you can head directly across the river via the tram or on foot to the Funicular Railway near the Újezd tram stop. Using the line is cheap and a ticket can be purchased which gives you 24hr access. The ride is short but exciting with a stop 3/4 of the way up and then at the very top. Once at the top, there are multiple cafes and places to visit including an observatory and gardens. The Petrin Lookout Tower is a must-visit for the best 360-degree view of the city. It is 63.5 metres tall and was built in 1891, resembling a miniature Eiffel Tower. Scale the tower for a small price via the spiral staircase. There is a cafe and restaurant at the base of the tower. Once done, return down the hill using the Funicular Railway.
A new addition to Prague is the temporary exhibition of Russian military vehicles destroyed by the Ukrainian army in 2022. Take the tram from the funicular railway to the North of Letna Park to visit the vehicles bringing the message of Ukraine’s defiance to the rest of Europe. From there you can walk through the large green park to the famous 75 ft functioning Prague Metronome which sits overlooking the river. It was erected in 1991 on the plinth left vacant by the 1963 demolition of an enormous monument to the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.
Dinner: Wine O’Clock Shop Prague, a fantastic dining experience where the food is cooked in front of you. The restaurant is small, so book in advance!

What’s the first thing after landing? It’s definitely searching how to go to the city.
From London and Stansted Airport, the airport express ticket is about 20 GBP (24 EUR). Then guess how much the airport express bus ticket in Prague costs? It is 100 CZK (4 EUR). It is ONLY one-sixth! My price made my trip have a good beginning.
The public transportation system in Prague is well designed. The tickets are on time bases (eg. 30 mins, 45 mins). With the ticket, you can access all public transport (except airport express), including trams, buses, and the metro. The ticket vending machine can be found at the metro station.
Besides the tourist spots, you also can find the historical atmosphere in the entire city. Every corner of the city shows its special stories. From the bridge, castles, to the stores, none of them let me down.
The beauty of the city shines especially during sunset. The sunshine covers the roofs and makes the city even more orange. My friend and I enjoyed the sunset view at the castle, which is on the hill. There is no word able to describe how stunning it was.
Prague is a special capital. The city is full of stories. For example, it is where the Defenestration of Prague happened, which leads to the Thirty Years’ War. Now you can see how important a role Prague plays in history. If you are interested in European history, Prague definitely drives you crazy.
Same as in many touristy areas, the prices in the center of Prague are also “touristy.” My friend and I, luckily, found a local café with a cozy environment and affordable price. It is called Sladká Cesta Caffé.
There are various cakes and pies. The price is about 80–100 CZK. According to my friend, who studies in Germany, some desserts are also common in Germany.
Chill time! Sitting in the café, enjoying the desserts, and watching the passengers on the streets.
Kürtőskalács (Trdelník) 煙囪卷
There are tremendous trdelník stores on the street. The price is about 70 CZK without ice cream and 130 CZK with ice cream.
The root of this word, trdlo, is the name of the wooden tool the cake ingredients are wrapped around during cooking.
In my opinion, ice cream is not necessary. Ice cream covers the flavor of the bread and makes the pastry too sweet. The crispy hot bread with spread is just right!
Prague Ham
Near the Old Town Square, some food stands sell Prague ham.
It is tasty and juicy, but it is not affordable. The price is based on the weight of the ham. I would suggest you have someone and share it together if you want to give it a try.
Different from other tourists, we are really looking forward to something natural and special.
We used to plan to visit Bohemian, which takes 2 hours by train from Prague, but it would make the schedule too tense. After discussion, we decided to go to a natural park called Dioká Šárka in the countryside.
It is at the final station of tram no. 26. The entrance of the park is right next to the station. The park is easily accessible from the city. It takes about 30 mins by tram from the city center.
Unfortunately, it was not warm enough when we visited the park. There were rarely leaves. When the spring comes, the entire park is going to be amazing and really good for picnics.
There are several routes. You can walk by the river or go hiking. Trees, rivers, birds, and hills. The views can definitely purify your mind and help you stay away from annoying things.
Look at the picture below. Can you imagine how beautiful the park is going to be? Don’t miss the park when you visit Prague.
The international stamps (Z stamps) sold in Prague are the most beautiful I have ever seen!
The price for each international stamp is 45 CZK. Compared with other European countries, the price is relatively affordable.
BTW, the post office in Prague is also beautiful and spacious. If you want to send the postcards, find Česká Pošta near the train station.

About three months ago, I decided to put my doctoral thesis in English on hold, sell most of my things and move from California to Prague to start my first job as a Junior Full Stack Developer at Pipedrive. This is a story about my journey and how I got to Pipedrive, Prague.
Since 2013 I have been pursuing a Ph.D. in English at the University of California Riverside, outside Los Angeles. In addition to teaching undergraduate film and literature classes, I spent several years working on a thesis project. My dissertation analyses the experimental art practices of a small group of twentieth-century American artists and writers.
In the summer of 2020, I committed myself to making a career change out of higher education. Without a specific job in mind, I knew that I needed work that would be intellectually challenging if I were to remain interested and motivated in the long run. I was also attracted to the flexibility that a career in tech could provide: finding software domains that match my interests, organizing my own schedule and remote job options. Beyond building an embarrassingly personal website in high school, I had no previous experience in IT. My initial plan was to take online courses and slowly develop my technical knowledge, but when I heard about a coding Bootcamp at my university, I decided to enroll.
My background in art criticism and education may not immediately make sense as a foundation for a career in software development. As I have learned more about programming, I came to find that humanities scholarship and web development actually have a lot in common. Both combine the creative with the logical. They are challenging endeavors that benefit from ongoing learning and continual revision. Over time, my awareness of the many intersections grew, along with my enthusiasm. Although I initially thought that my previous, non-technical experience would be irrelevant to development, I now realize that my background has provided me with a lot of important and valuable skills — communication, critical thinking and research, to name a few — that have helped me to get to where I am today.
Ultimately, while my work as a teacher and a researcher was very rewarding, I came to feel that the direct practicality and collaboration that is so fundamental to software development were missing from my daily work. In response to this feeling, in June 2020, I set a goal to devote 30–60 minutes a day towards learning web development. After doing some light internet browsing, I thought that computer science fundamentals would provide a strong foundation for learning programming, so I decided to start with a CS101 course on Udemy. In a way, the shift to fully remote university instruction gave me more freedom to balance my work with my new objective. When I heard about The Coding Bootcamp at my university, I felt that the structure of a curriculum and the community of students that the Bootcamp offered would be a good environment for me.
Because the class was entirely online, I learned to remotely collaborate on projects with teammates from the very beginning. The class was a six-month, part-time, full-stack web development class focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and React. In addition to the essential languages of the web, we also learned some basics about databases and using git. The class met online three days a week for about three hours. Although it was roughly 10 hours of class time, we were expected to put in close to 15–20 weekly hours of work outside class meetings to practice our skills and solidify the concepts we covered.
During the week, we met twice in the evenings and we also had one class on Saturday mornings. The schedule was designed to accommodate people who were attending class while working full time. Because of my flexible work schedule, I was able to thrive with this schedule, but it was very demanding for many of my classmates with stricter work responsibilities. Every week, we had homework assignments related to our weekly topics, which we submitted by posting Github links. The teacher and teaching assistant encouraged us to keep our Github accounts active to establish professional visibility.
Every two months, we had to deliver a major group project. Of course, the opportunity to work on a larger project was rewarding in and of itself, but it was also a great chance to function within a self-organized team. For a final project, I worked with a team of three others to develop an inventory tracking application using React and MongoDB. One of our team members gathered specific information from her clients who worked in logistics about a major problem they faced: quick and easy access to inventory item locations in the warehouse. With this real-world use case, we each spent several hours a day over three weeks developing our application, “InHouse.” In addition to the supportive community, I think that this experience in building a full-stack web application with a team using the git version control system was one of the most valuable aspects of my Bootcamp experience.
Immediately after completing the Bootcamp, I was determined to maintain my momentum, so I began applying to jobs and talking to as many people in the industry as I possibly could. Setting up 30-minute chats on zoom — what people sometimes call “informational interviewing”– was a great way to gather information about working in tech. I was able to ask people about their background, how they got into the field and what their workday is like in their current role. It was also a good chance to practice presenting myself and my interests in a low-stakes and supportive context.
At the same time, I continued to work on personal projects and jumped headfirst into LeetCode algorithm problems, something that was not a part of the core curriculum of the Bootcamp. I also continued to improve my personal website and started several projects to expand my portfolio. Probably one of the most difficult but important tasks for my website was making it mobile responsive!
I designed a landing page for a friend’s small business, which was a good chance to practice client requirements gathering, wireframing and Figma prototyping. I took part in an international hackathon called Hacktrix. Communicating with my partner and transcending a 12-hour time difference, together we built a simple news aggregator. The hackathon was another great collaboration experience and it gave me more practice in quickly developing an app that uses a third-party API service.
I also began helping a graduate student friend improve the structure of their excavation research database for their dissertation project in archaeology. That project was an opportunity to gather information about a particular problem while also learning how to effectively create an Entity Relationship Diagram using LucidChart. This technology helped me to visually plan out the structure of the database and the relationships between different tables.
Although I rarely completed (and certainly never sold) these projects, each of them helped me to learn new things while I continued to practice web development. They also enabled me to learn which aspects of development I enjoy more and where my (numerous, countless!) gaps in knowledge reside.
During my ongoing learning after graduating from the bootcamp, I became interested in Open Source communities. I started slowly by learning how to fork a repository and did some basic markdown housekeeping for a student-run resource called awesome4girls, which offers a curated list of events and projects in tech geared specifically for girls and women. My dive into the open-source community also brought me to AnitaB.org, a nonprofit organization working to improve inclusivity in tech. They have a number of student-friendly projects on Github and actively cultivate mentorship and contributions from new developers. Through this organization, I got my first experience setting up a more complicated local development environment on my computer.
I learned about Pipedrive during the research phase for one of my Bootcamp group projects. While trying to develop a project idea, I conducted some interviews with real estate professionals to gather information about their current software and look for potential opportunities to solve a problem. Armed with a relevant user story, I pitched a CRM project to track potential tenant leads and as a team we developed a modest, full-stack implementation. The research that I did for that project led me to Pipedrive as one of the top models for our small application.
When I first came across the job post for a Junior Developer position at Pipedrive, I was immediately struck by how entry-level-friendly the post was. It was clear that they really wanted a Junior Developer and that my inexperience was not some shortcoming that I had to justify or minimize. It was also clear that my professional development would be actively supported and that Pipedrive would be an ideal place to grow. There was no shortage of online information for me to access to familiarize myself with the company culture. I read several articles from this blog: one about our group product manager and another one on the onboarding process written by two junior engineers. I gained a lot of insight into the current topics, culture and people involved in the company from these publicly-accessible posts.
In the end, Pipedrive made it easy for me to make the big decision to accept the offer and move to Prague. I was honestly not expecting to pull off a complete career change one year after I started the Bootcamp. The accountability and community structures that the Bootcamp provided were definitely key factors of my success. While I was looking for my first software developer job, I noticed that a lot of online forums highlight (and bemoan) the low response rate in job applications. This is certainly a frustrating and complicated problem.
Still, in my case, I tried to not think about what I couldn’t control and focused on finding a balance between consistency, feedback processing and a strategic search. I found a company working on a product in an area that interested me and reached out to a Pipedrive recruiter directly on LinkedIn. But it was also important for me to maintain a healthy mindset, so I made sure to pace myself, exercise and spend time with friends. Resting and walking my dog Poppy were essential parts of the search!
I’m glad that my circuitous career route has led me here to Prague, and I hope that this story might offer some perspective for other potential Pipedrivers.
Here at Pipedrive’s Prague office, our Group Product Manager Michal Smetana has been organizing monthly meetups. During the fall this year we hosted an event on GraphQL at Scale with guest speakers and a live stream of the event. We have also had a meetup on Advanced Microservices.

I can mean this in the most basic way possible, of course. Stepping off the plane, I was an eighteen year old baby. Now, I’m twenty-one (and still a baby). I’ve finished uni, gotten into a relationship, and made lifelong friends from people around the world. I’ve lived in two different flats in Prague, with vastly different situations. My style has changed more times than I can count on my two hands.
But, as I was telling my mom, it feels like I’m leaving a friend. I never experienced Prague like the big packs of British guys coming for a stag do or the backpacking groups that are here for a long weekend before they bounce off somewhere else.
I don’t relate to the videos fawning over Duplex or the five story club of Karlovy Lazne. The Charles Bridge and Old Town Square became a route I would only walk through out of pure necessity, a scene I should’ve never taken for granted.
The Prague that I know is the sun setting over Žižkov on the rooftop of my friends’ apartment, sharing a bottle of white wine, a pack of cigarettes, and some hummus from Albert.

Jozef is a Slovakian living in Prague. Although he joined our team only half a year ago, it almost feels like he’s been here forever. He always has a plan, knows his way around all things design, and is the best man for any type of ideation. Jozef also hates discovering new places alone and apparently loves vodka.
What do you do?
I’m a product designer.
And I mean, what do you really do all day?
My days really differ according to which phase of a product we are working on. So, it can range from sketching user flows/stories, testing ideas, prototyping, working on visuals or preparing exports for dev guys — very colorful.
What keeps you motivated?
People I am working with ‘cause they’re really good at what they do, so I can learn from them and get inspired. And also our users. It’s really motivating and challenging to design something people like using.
What’s your song of the day?
I don’t have one. Recently, I started to love my spotify discover or some indie mixes.
What’s been the most recent life lesson?
I read few articles that the tech industry is about to change massively in the next decade. For me it means we should never stop exploring the unknown. For example, I seriously started to learn how to code but it’s going really slowly.
What are your all-time favourites? Any underrated or classic TV-shows, books, music you would like to share?
I really love the email digest and newsletters I receive. Just to mention few I rely on — Sidebar, Medium digest, UX daily and so on. I also watch series on Netflix and cooking videos on Youtube. And last but not least I recently bought some books about typography and a few posters.
Describe the scariest moment of your life.
The scariest one was definitely when I had a car accident with my friends. It happened so quickly. The car was totally crushed but luckily nobody was seriously injured. Before the crash I loved speed and extreme sports. Since then I am totally the opposite. This kind of thing changes you forever.
What are the five things you’d take to a desert island?
A bottle, swiss knife, matches, vodka and some book about how to survive on a desert island.
What do you wish you had known 5 years ago?
That being yourself is just what matters the most.
One thing you really like about your job and another you don’t like that much?
I really like that I can be independent and at the same time responsible. It kind of makes me feel I’m working on my own thing which is very important to me. On the other hand, I don’t like being without the team from time to time. But we meet up in almost every 3 months, so it’s not that bad.
What’s your one big dream or life goal?
Being totally independent in terms of everything like money and schedule. Just waking up and doing what I want.
What are your most recent discoveries? Any tv-shows podcasts, blogs, books we should keep our eyes on?
Treehouse — really cool site regarding how to learn code.
What are you really grateful of today?
That I woke up today.
The blog posts are a part of our ongoing campaign demonstrating the merits of gratitude. Join the campaign and check out other entries! 💚

Tucked away in one of Prague’s quieter corners, EFSY feels like the kind of place you stumble upon once and never forget. I had been seeing it pop up on Instagram for a while – always these dreamy shots of perfectly poached eggs, colorful lattes, and that minimal-but-cozy interior – so I finally decided to check it out for myself. And honestly? I’m so glad I did.
When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was how peaceful the atmosphere felt. It’s bright, thoughtfully designed, and somehow manages to strike the perfect balance between modern and warm. You instantly get the sense that every detail – from the playlist to the ceramic plates – has been chosen with care.
On this visit, I ordered the Turkish eggs and the green salad with raspberries, and both dishes were genuinely memorable. The Turkish eggs were silky and flavorful, served with creamy yogurt, spicy chilli oil, and perfectly boiled eggs that just melted into everything. It was comforting, rich, and yet still light – I loved every bite. As for the green salad, it totally surprised me. The raspberries added such a unique sweetness, and paired with the greens and light honey dressing AND PECANS, it felt super fresh and summery. It was one of those combinations that makes you think, “Why haven’t I tried this before?”
What made the visit even more special was learning that EFSY is celebrating its very first birthday. It’s wild to think that this cozy little café – which already feels so established and beloved – has only been open for a year. The owners launched EFSY with a clear vision: to create a space that goes beyond good coffee and food, and actually feels like a little escape. Over the past 12 months, it’s grown into a real community spot, where you can tell the regulars are part of the café’s story too. I really respect how they’ve stayed true to their values – simplicity, quality, and creativity – while still experimenting with their menu and aesthetic.
Even during their birthday, when the place was buzzing with energy and filled with more guests than usual, the service stayed warm and attentive. The staff made me feel welcome without ever being too much – they seemed genuinely happy to share the space with everyone. That kind of hospitality makes a big difference, especially in a city where cafes can sometimes feel a bit rushed or transactional.
If you’re into food that feels both comforting and inspired, beautiful interiors, and supporting small local businesses with heart, EFSY is 100% worth a visit. Whether you’re going for brunch with friends, working solo with a matcha in hand, or just treating yourself to something nice – you’ll walk out feeling better than when you walked in. I know I did.
Happy birthday, EFSY – here’s to many more!🤍

2. Likewise, beer is cheaper than water. All of it tastes great. The cheap beer here would put Coors Light and Pabst Blue Ribbon to shame.
3. Communist jokes are never okay. Soviet rule lasted for over twenty years. Don’t be that culturally-insensitive jerk — better yet — from the United States.
4. The pancakes are not what you expect them to be. Unless you’re ordering at a Western chain like McDonald’s or Starbucks, most items on the menu are not what you think they are.
5. If you practice your Czech unannounced, there is a high chance the locals won’t like you. In restaurants, I’d try ordering in Czech. However, when I jumped into practicing the language without asking politely, a server normally would spit out a complicated phrase I didn’t understand.
6. Don’t make conversation on public transit. You’ll stick out obnoxiously, especially if you are talking loudly.
7. There’s nowhere else in the world quite like Prague. Complete with a Puma Bar and a wall dedicated to John Lennon, there’s something different everyone can enjoy.

Revisiting Prague after 25 years was a mix of nostalgia and a bit of culture shock. When I first visited in 1999, the city felt like a page torn from a romantic fairytale. Its stunning Gothic architecture in its old town, Staré Město, had charming streets, and an almost magical old-world ambiance that made my heart sing.
This time, the fairytale setting was still there, but so were the crowds. I had originally gone in the summertime, yet somehow, my early March visit this year felt significantly more packed. If it’s this crowded in the off-season, I can’t even imagine what the summer months are like now.
The Charles Bridge was a frustrating pedestrian traffic jam. Every major sight was shoulder-to-shoulder with tourists from all over Europe. And while I expected some level of development, seeing Starbucks and other American brand stores scattered throughout the city was a bit disheartening.
Granted the weather was unseasonably warm and beautiful, which might have made everyone walk…

Notes and Stories about UI Design, UX Design and Other Related Topics.

by Brett Mazoch, published in A Designer’s Thoughts
Business, creativeness and development met together under the same roof again in the historical Prague in Czech Republic. Enthusiastic speakers from Google, Microsoft, Slack and others shared their inspirational thoughts and ideas. Local startups and established tech companies showcased their work. Businessmen, designers and developers networked in a friendly and supportive atmosphere… And three months ago I was lucky to experience all of this during the WebExpo conference (23–24th Sep 2016).
Since I still have in my mind great talks about designing systems in difficult places, Google’s agile design process or about meaningful animations in user interfaces, I would like to share my memories and thoughts from this great conference before the New Year arrives.
For those who haven’t heard about the conference yet: WebExpo started as a small meet up of people interested in the digital world and throughout the years it has turned into the largest tech conference in Central Europe. The sign of the quality are excited speakers from industry leading companies like the mentioned Google, Microsoft, Slack or several other as IBM, Adobe, MSD/Merck or InVision. On top of that, the conference takes place in a location which anyone can easily fall in love with because of its charming old architecture and delicious Czech beer — the city of Prague.
I attended 12 talks and since in our software company — Bluewire Technologies in Bristol (England) — I am working as a UI Designer, my schedule was full of talks on design related topics. I’ve realised that the talks I enjoyed the most were those in which the speakers shared their own personal experience and some good & bad real examples supported by their own testing or research.
The following 6 talks definitely met my internal criteria for the great performance. And, in addition to that, their content resonates with my current focus and interests. I enjoyed the ones mentioned below the most and I think you might do so as well, here we go:
Mark Boulton, Design Director at Monotype
MY TAKEAWAY…
When designing a system, start learning about your users, about who the users actually are. Creating simple design models based on the users study will help you in specific cases and situations with the answer to the question ‘How should the solution look like?’. Also provide a framework to support creativity in others by giving them well-designed parameters to work within rather then trying to be a design police. And finally understand (and eventually modify) the workflow to establish a mandate for the system.
Mark has also published a FREE e-book, really worth reading, called Designing for the Web in which he describes his design process and basics about typography, colours and layout.
WATCH THE TALK…
Dana Cohen, Strategic UX Designer at Google Campus
MY TAKEAWAY…
A team of multidisciplinary experts, led by an experienced Design Master, can find and test a solution very quickly and effectively before even starting programming by following the agile Design Sprint methodology. You will end up with well-discussed decisions and tested prototypes which means that you can save your development resources. You will also involve stakeholders and other team members into a design phase very soon and that means a bigger connection and a better satisfaction with the final solution.
If you are thinking about introducing this design methodology in your project, then definitely have a look at the Google’s website The Design Sprint. There you can find a comprehensive guide, video examples and other learning sources.
WATCH THE TALK…
Tom Giannattasio, Director of Product at InVision
MY TAKEAWAY…
When thinking about incorporating animations into user interfaces, we should consider its purpose and actually have a good reason for incorporating them. We can think about these purposes for animations:
Explain — aid a user’s understanding of the content,Acquaint — aid a user’s understanding of the architecture,Change — switch an element’s meaning or behaviour,Indicate — clarify the current state or the changes to it,Convey — build a sense of quality or character,Entertain — lighten the mood or occupy the user,Delight — surprise with clever craftsmanship,Engage — make the user an active participant in the interface.
Have a look at Tom’s animated presentation with examples.
WATCH THE TALK…
Adrian Zumbrunnen, Freelance UX Engineer at Google
MY TAKEAWAY…
Aiming only for delight when designing animations is not enough. It is about creating meaningful interactions. Animate meaningfully and smartly. Don’t over animate your product. Focus more on smart motion and micro animations which do give gentle feedback and which explain, navigate and tell the story. Meaningful motion is about keeping your eyes on details.
WATCH THE TALK…
Jan Kvasnička, UX designer
MY TAKEAWAY…
In a mobile era we should optimise our designs for different and small resolutions. The optimisation for phone devices definitely pays off and in the future the impact will be even more significant. When designing for small resolution environments, definitely follow good mobile design principles and patterns. But that design optimisation should be based more importantly on information gathered from user testing and the analysis of real users behaviour.
You can find a lot of screenshots with explanatory notes at Jan’s article Practical guide to the most common mistakes of mobile and responsive web design (written in Czech only).
WATCH THE TALK (in Czech only)…

MY TAKEAWAY…Thanks to a quick and informal user testing we can find important things in our products worth improving. And, surprisingly, even cheap and easy changes — based on insights from a simple user testing — can make the users’ experience way, way much better. Don’t underestimate the user testing.
In the articles Unusability of Bitcoin ATM and Improvement of Bitcoin ATM (both written in Czech only) is available introduced user experience study with videos taken during the user testing of bitcoin ATM.
WATCH THE TALK (in Czech only)…
It was my very first time at the conference and I was captured by its digital vibe and really enjoyed this special event. I was walking from one talk to another with great interest in what I am about to hear, see and learn. And that is what I am always expecting from such a conference. If you are interested, you can watch all its talks on business, design and development topics at WebExpo Videos.
Thank you to promoters and speakers who prepared an entertaining mix of topics. I hope to see you next time WebExpo!

This is the second piece in my series on street photography locations in Prague, and today, I would like to write about Hradčany, the castle district. It’s a place that holds a special, personal kind of charm — not just because of its history and beauty, but because it feels like home to me.
Living just a short, fifteen-minute walk away from the St. Vitus Cathedral, it’s usually the place where I go to reconnect with the city, camera in hand.
Also, my wife and I have a ritual related to this district: after any trip away from Prague, we head to a spot we simply call “The Terrace”, a viewpoint at the intersection of Ke Hradu and Hradčanské Náměstí, and stand there for five quiet minutes, taking in the sweeping view of the city’s rooftops and towers and the distant hum of life below. On a quieter day, if there are fewer tourists in front of the Cathedral — this area and the nearby Starbucks can get quite busy — it’s a moment to arrive and feel grounded here.
Hradčany is a little different from what you might think of when someone talks about street photography. It’s not the kind of place where you’ll find a bustling crowd or fleeting, dramatic moments.
It’s quieter here, slower. There aren’t many chances to catch the apex of a situation, that decisive moment of tension or drama that many associate with the genre. Some might argue this isn’t street photography at all, more like urban exploration or architectural photography — and if you are lucky — with a touch of life.
For me, street photography is about finding stories wherever you are, even in quieter moments (also, I am not taking this super-seriously). In Hradčany, the stories can be found in more subtle things: a man smoking while standing next to his old Škoda Felicia, street musicians waiting for their ride after a day’s performance, or a lone figure disappearing into a shadowy alley. (Small note here: maybe this slowness is not entirely true to the closest vicinity of the Cathedral, “inside” the castle’s courtyards, or along Nerudova, which are always full of wandering tourists.)
The district’s slopes are a recurring theme in my images. The streets here rise and fall unpredictably, creating natural compositions that are both dynamic and harmonious. I often align the roads with the buildings in my shots to emphasize the incline. And, for reasons I can’t fully explain, most of my photos here end up in portrait orientation. It’s a pattern I just noticed when I walked through the photographs I took in this area. Perhaps it’s the verticality of the streets and facades, and because of the narrow streets, this feels more natural, as I can include more of the buildings and make the photos cleaner.
Outside the crowded heart of the castle complex, Hradčany feels almost untouched. Streets like Nový Svět, Černínská, and almost up to Pohořelec, reveal a different side of the district, where life seems to unfold at its own pace. Some of the old houses here are waiting for renovation, their faded walls and crooked windows adding layers of texture and character. These are the streets where you can find children on their phones in front of an old church — now a hotel, funnily enough — and these quiet, everyday scenes are what I sometimes find compelling to photograph. It might not fit the usual mold of street photography, but it can still be satisfying.
In conclusion, Hradčany isn’t about fast-paced action or dramatic moments; it’s about the quiet interplay of people and place. The district invites you to slow down, pay attention, and appreciate the timeless vibe it has to offer. If you’re a photographer seeking calm, understated beauty, this might just be the perfect spot for you.
Thanks for reading to the end! If you enjoyed this or have any thoughts, I’d appreciate your 👏 claps and comments — see you in the next chapter!

Last night I flew back from my first live international conference. Being flown abroad to speak was an exciting milestone in my career! The first day the ~20 international speakers had breakfast at the hotel, went on a guided walking tour of Prague, lunch together out, and then met up with the ~50 local speakers plus the mentors, round table facilitators, and everyone else, for an icebreaker and dinner, followed by the first party where early attendees joined. It was a whirlwind. Then the conference began.
Main takeaway from my time with the international speakers — we all feel a little “fake it til you make it”. All making last minute adjustments to our slides and practicing one (or three) last time(s) in our hotel rooms. You might not guess that from the impression we give on stage, or on paper. Why is that important? It means no one should be afraid to apply to speak, too. It was a very humble group. From the most well-known to those speaking for the first time, 100% of the speakers were down to earth, friendly, and excited to be there.
Which led to a really interesting conversation over lunch between some of the international speakers and one of the conference organizers: why aren’t there more new faces and how do we change that?
Part of the problem is the built-in bias of speaker applications — new voices didn’t apply. Women and minorities didn’t apply. That put the organizers in a pickle, who desperately wanted a more diverse lineup.
Then there was the part about some of the new-voice applications not being as good, which makes sense, these are people with less experience. The conference is only as good as its content and keeping a super high standard is critical for success.
We started brainstorming what we, the experienced speakers and conference organizers, could do to change that. How do we get more, better applications from inexperienced speakers? A whole bunch of ideas were thrown out and it was reassuring to hear that this is a common value for the people who are most empowered to make change. (I also suggested getting in touch with Button organizers because in my opinion they are trail blazers in getting DEI right. Will let the WebExpo organizers catch their breath before picking that back up where we left it :)
My talk didn’t go as well as I’d hoped. I’m a pretty harsh critic of myself so I’ve spent a huge amount of energy analyzing why. My conclusions:
All in all, WebExpo was an amazing experience! Being on my own away from my family which is a very very very rare occurrence; being abroad which, other than the US, I haven’t done in years; the shear size of the conference and venue; being an invited international speaker. I’m sure I’ll be processing for a while and what it means for the types of opportunities I want to take on next.

First of all, it’s so fantastic to have such industry-oriented ML conference around. Focusing on deliverable impact, but without irritating business content. Diving into comprehensible theory, but without overhyped papers. All is just set right. Moreover, it’s hard to imagine a better place for this than historical Rudolfinum building in the cultural heart of central Europe: Prague.
In this blog post, I’m sharing some of my notes from this conference.
Walking around the conference building and having talks with industry representatives, I noticed three basic prototypes of modern ML-driven industries:
The good part about these segments is that the people were authentic, so you could quickly decide how is it beneficial to keep the conversation.
Overall there were almost 50 talks and I haven’t watched all of them. I was convinced to attend only if there was a resonating company, person or an academy. The content and talk title doesn’t guarantee anything.
Anomaly detection talks use to provide a completely new way / paradigm of finding data inconsistencies. In this case, it was Quantum Mechanics, which partially triggered me since the proposed algorithm had only a single weak property in common with QM. As a former physicist, I have a particular dislike of self-anointed “discoveries”, unclear analogies and buzzwording.
Apart from this, I have to admit, the algorithm itself for generating locally similar bitmaps is quite impressive. See here: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse
Algebraic Topology, as a subfield of mathematics and space analysis, is inevitably emerging as a useful way of thinking while solving problems in multidimensional spaces. In this talk, Leland McInnes drafted the idea of using manifolds, functors and other fancy abstractions, leading to the UMAP algorithm: a string dimensionality reduction technique, similar to the famous t-SNE.
He also shared the presentation on Twitter so you can look by yourself:https://speakerdeck.com/lmcinnes/learning-topology-topological-methods-for-unsupervised-learning
Clearly the best story-telling talk of the conference. Starting with a market fit (although a controversial one), poor 1st model, continuing in augmentation and preprocessing, tuning and finishing with the representative output. That’s how the ML story should be told.
This one really surprised me. Fast-growing companies such as Spotify usually don’t speak a lot about their used technologies, techniques and best practices. They rather retain the hype and promise a lot. Not in this case.
Marc Romeyn from Spotify revealed quite a lot and it was stunning. However, it seemed to me the talk was shortened from an around 1h long one to the restricted 30 mins. It was not possible to keep up with the speaker’s flow and the content on slides.
For more info, I recommend to check out the Spotify’s official technology blog:https://labs.spotify.com
It’s interesting to find out there are modern artists using ML to investigate creativity.
A beautiful choice for the ending talk of the conference :)

That’s the main statement at the front of the MLprague’s page and cannot be more eloquent. Personally, I appreciate all the work done by organisers in order to fulfil this mission. However, I’m also going to point out a few drawbacks and I will help myself with other quotes from the webpage:
I can confirm this was true in most cases. Sometimes, I would appreciate more time invested in a preparation for speaker's talk and, surprisingly, less content. The most interesting lectures had much to say, but they were so rich that they would be better at half-speed.
Next, one of the key parameters for enjoying the talk is the perfect sound balance in the lecture room. This was not well set on the ground floor. Thus I was recommended many times to go upstairs and find a seat near the loudspeakers where the sound was much cleaner and without echoes.
Also, I heavily missed the Slido (Q&A platform) during the talks. Many on-point questions were unrevealed in the end. I think it was a reaction after last year's hates and jokes that appeared. This can be fixed by moderation.
Great initiative to offer local foods / standards, really. However the international kitchen has moved to a more healthy level, so constantly offering baguettes and no salads or fruits is not a good idea.
Nevertheless, it was a well-organised conference! I’m returning home to refresh and looking forward to the next year edition.
PS: If you are a student and don’t have money to pay for this conference, it is possible to go as a volunteer. And it’s absolutely feasible to do the work and enjoy the content besides. PM me or directly the organisers for more info :)
