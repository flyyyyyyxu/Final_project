Having read plenty of online reviews, travel blogs and YouTube videos on the Greek capital, I had the impression that Athens would be a dull and hectic city — with some random ancient ruins dumped on a hill in the middle of it all.
And while the some suburbs certainly have this “rundown, hectic” vibe, the historic center shocked me!
I visited in the middle of August 2023 — peak tourist season in Europe. As you can imagine, it was very hot! And while the city was certainly beaming with tourists, there was a chilled ambiance within the historic center… Green-leaved trees lining cobbled streets filled with quaint shops, flea markets, cafes and restaurants. And not to forget, the occasional grandpa sitting on his stool signing Greek songs with his acoustic guitar… Very Greek!
I think Athens is a perfect destination for a three day long weekend break. Outside of the main attractions — the Acropolis, the Ancient Agora and the Temple of Zeus — there actually isn’t ‘too’ much to do. And all the sites and attractions are all within walking distance in the historic center. But don’t get me wrong, I certainly wouldn’t have minded spending longer in order to line up my stomach with endless kebabs and gyros (yum)!
If this all sounds appealing — go and book flights and your accommodation! Below I will give a brief overview of my trip…
I arrived in Athens around 7:30am local time after a 3.5 hour flight from Riga, having spent the previous ten days in the Baltic states. Luckily Latvia and Greece are in the same time zone, so no jetlag… But, yes, it was not easy getting sleep on an early hours flight! Plus, my flight was slightly delayed (but not quite enough for me to claim compensation — aha!)
Athens airport is connected by the Athens metro system on Metro Line 3. Using the metro is the most convenient hassle-free way to get into the city. I actually have a YouTube shorts video which you can watch by clicking here on how to use the Athens metro.
The journey from the airport into Monastiraki station (the metro station bang in the city center) is approximately 45 minutes. The intense early morning heat could be felt immediately after coming out of the station! I dropped off my bags at my accommodation and headed straight for the Acropolis.
I highly recommend booking tickets to the Acropolis in advance in order to skip the queues (which can be long). You can book tickets for the Acropolis by clicking here — and you can also book guided tours and audio tours via the link as well!
Important tip: do not forget to bring your phone or camera with you to take endless pictures of all the ruins and the incredible skyline views of the city — you’re going to want to! And another word of warning — make sure you wear trainers with a solid grip! The Acropolis is full of slippery marble on the ground.
After a couple of hours of enjoying the spectacular ruins and the breathtaking city skyline, I felt pretty hungry. I headed a restaurant called Thanasis, which is located within close proximity to Monstiraki station. I indulged in a traditional Greek salad and a lovely meat kebab with yoghurt and tomato sauce all drenched on a soft piece of pita — and an ice cold Mythos beer too!
I then got a bit of a nap after a long day, and later headed out to Athens Hawk Hostel rooftop bar — there are many rooftop bars across the city and I definitely recommend you visit one. You get incredible views of the Parthenon lit up under the night sky.
My second day began by walking down to the Hellenic Parliament building. I was amazed how the guards were able to withstand 35 degrees Celsius height whilst in full clothing — poor blokes!
I then headed down to Panathenaic Stadium — the host stadium of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. You may be interested in booking not only a guided tour of the stadium, but also an Olympic style workout on the stadium! Click here if you’re interested!
Next, I explored the Temple of Olympian Zeus — the ancient place of worship to Zeus. I enjoyed a nice stroll along the cobbled and marble streets within the historic centre. I then headed over to the Philopappos Monument to get some more skyline views across the city. The afternoon then finished with me heading to Tylixto Greek Wrap, where I enjoyed some gorgeous gyros — I highly recommend you come here to get some!
I had an early morning ferry to catch from Piraeus terminal to the island of Ios the next morning, so it was an early night for me. Just a word of warning however — if you are planning to go island hopping from Athens and you don’t have a rental car, make sure you depart from the Piraeus terminal. Piraeus is accessible on the Athens Metro system, and other terminals under the name “Athens” are not easily accessible by public transport.
After three days in Ios, I returned back to Piraeus after a seven hour ferry journey for my third and final day in Athens. I didn’t really get up to much on my final day — I needed to some laundry and I needed to catch up on some sleep! If you do need to get some laundry done, I highly recommend visiting the Easywash Self Service Laundry launderette located in the city center — just make sure you bring cash in euros with you to insert into the machines. You can buy washing detergent capsules in the vending machines in the store — no need to take your own!
I finished my time in Athens by having a lovely meal at the Maiandros restaurant off the corner from Monastiraki Square — pita bread, babaganoush, hummus and some kebab with fries were all on the menu for me.
And then it was straight to bed for me, as I had a 9am flight to catch the next morning to Tirana, Albania. Do note that if you are planning to head on from Greece onto either Albania or North Macedonia, both of those countries are not in the EU, so when you arrive you will need to get new physical SIM cards, or you could get an eSIM.
But in conclusion, I would highly recommend visiting! It would say, however, may consider visiting Athens during shoulder season — the heat in July and August is very intense. But even in the hot summer heat, I thought it was still ‘bearable’, due to the heat being more of a “dry heat” rather than a humid one.
Thanks for reading! I highly recommend getting a VPN for your travels — it will keep your devices protected from malware in public neworks and also VPNs allow you to change to virtual location of your internet connection, so you can access blocked websites and resources in the country you are currently in.

Apart from maybe Paris, I don’t think there’s a city that I have heard more mixed reviews about than Athens. Over the years I have been told all sorts of things: It’s dirty, it’s the most beautiful place you could ever visit, it’s disappointing… Still, Athens was very high on my list of cities I absolutely wanted to visit, and as a lover of all things Greek mythology my hopes were high. This summer was my first with a boyfriend, and he’s even more into Greek mythology than I am (I swear he knows the details of all of these gods like they’re his family members) and so the destination of our first trip together (AKA The Big Relationship Test) had been decided.
To everyone who told me that Athens was a disappointment: Did we visit the same place? Even the first night, the very first walk through the city, I knew that Athens was about to snatch a place in my top 5 favourite cities. Honestly, what’s not to like? The incredible atmosphere? The amazing and cheap food? The breathtaking architecture? The fact that there’s cats EVERYWHERE?! I fell in love instantly.
Here’s a little overview of what our holiday in Athens looked like. Warning: As much as I enjoyed it, this trip did not go smoothly. What did you expect? It’s me.
We rented an Airbnb on a street called Kolokotroni. The location could honestly not be better. The studio was basically in the middle of the city and we were surrounded by restaurants and shops. The flat itself was lovely. It had a little balcony, it was nicely decorated and you could tell the owner had put a lot of effort into it.
Unfortunately, we did have some issues with the hot water. I had received instructions that you had to press a button every time you wanted to shower and then wait for about 30 minutes. That in itself is not a problem, although it’s not exactly ideal when you need to get up early and you want to shower as quickly as possible. But the bigger issue was that, even after the whole button-pressing ritual, there was not nearly enough hot water for both of us. The building itself also didn’t make me feel super safe, so although it was a great stay considering how affordable it was, I would not recommend it, especially as a solo traveller.
I arrived in the afternoon, ready to get to know Athens by myself. Since we had booked separate flights, my boyfriend wasn’t arriving until the next evening. I went to drop off my stuff at the studio and then went for a walk in Plaka. I got some ice cream, took in the many beautiful squares and soaked up the ambiance that was being created by the hundreds of al fresco diners. During my walk I also discovered a souvenir shop called Thiki. It ended up being our favourite shop that week. I think we went there about four times. We learnt that the owner takes care of a number of street cats. She had named them all! Anyway, I got some souvlaki and feta fries to-go that I enjoyed on my balcony. Lovely first day.
I started with a walk around the Airbnb and ended up on this gorgeous square called Agia Irini Square. It is there that I would have many breakfasts and brunches. That day I had a great caesar salad at Tailor’s House, apparently one of Athens’ most popular coffee places. My favourite thing about this square? The fact that so many cats hang out there. My boyfriend was about to land that evening, so I had some time. I sat outside and read for a bit. The weather predictions for the rest of the day weren’t looking too optimistic, but up until that point everything was fine.
That is, until I continued my walk in Monastiraki. I was still having a jolly old time, meeting cats both outside and inside in shops, but it started to rain and it gradually got worse. I then went to a cafe with a nice view of the Ancient Agora, where I thought I could sit under the awning for a bit, until the rain turned into a storm and the whole thing came down so we had to flee inside. The street I had strolled down not even an hour earlier turned into a river and I saw doormats and chairs fly past. The water was knee-high, so I knew that I wasn’t leaving that cafe any time soon. Luckily, I had a good book with me. Then, my boyfriend texted me to let me know that his flight had been delayed because of the storm.
I was surprised to see that the water disappeared as quickly as it had come down. Within an hour the streets were fine again. At least in Athens, because I later heard that other parts of Greece had been heavily damaged. I then made the mistake of deciding to not go back to the studio and stay out until I could go and meet my boyfriend in the city. The rain stopped for maybe 30 minutes until it started again and I ended up in another cafe. I received an emergency alert that said everyone was strongly advised to stay inside as apparently Greece hadn’t seen a storm like this in a while. Great. I eventually had to leave the cafe and walk through the most intense downpour I have ever experienced. By the time I met up with my boyfriend, I was absolutely soaked.
We started our first full day together with a rainy morning, but luckily that was only the first hour and it didn’t rain anymore for the rest of the holiday. We went to check out the three impressive buildings that make up the Athenian trilogy: the university, the academy and the library. For lunch we went to a place called Mam that sells pastries with all kinds of filling. I went for spinach and feta but I have to admit I was jealous of the one with minced meat my boyfriend got.
We explored the Psyri area together and got ice cream from Kokkion. Delicious!
The big day. The reason many people visit Athens. And they’re absolutely right, because the Acropolis is something you just have to see. Nothing I could write here would do it justice. BUT BE WARNED. This has to be the worst-organised tourist attraction I have ever visited in my almost 31 years on this planet.
Let me set the scene for you. About two weeks prior to our visit I decided to buy our tickets in advance, and I was delighted to see that the official website offered a ‘Skip-the-line ticket’ that allows you to not have to queue and just walk right in. Perfect!
Cut to us arriving at the entrance that morning (which of course is quite the climb in itself) and taking in three extremely long lines, although one was clearly the longest and looked like it went almost all the way down the hill again. None of this mattered to us though, I proudly exclaimed, because we had skip-the-line tickets! Until an American woman next to me said ‘Yeah, that’s not a thing.’ Scuse me?
Turns out when they said ‘Skip-the-line ticket’, what they actually meant was ‘Queue-for-three-hours-instead-of-six’. Also, there are zero signs that explain what the different lines are for, where you have to go, nothing. We eventually figured out that we had to take the middle, second-longest line to have our digital tickets printed. And so we spent over two hours in the queue either batting away tour guides who promise to take you up there immediately but you basically have to pay all over again, or explaining to other confused visitors that they still had to queue. Yes, even with a ticket. Yes, Sir, I know it says ‘Skip-the-line’, so does mine…
Again, it is absolutely worth the hassle. You would just think that one of the world’s biggest tourist attractions would be better organised. After this adventure we visited the Acropolis Museum, which was almost just as spectacular. In the evening we went for dinner in a stunningly decorated restaurant called Tazza. We also had an ice cream parlour in our area called Le Greche that we went to for dessert almost every evening!
We bought the Athens Pass, which gives you access to the Acropolis and five other sites. I would definitely recommend getting one of those as you’ll save money even if you only visit two of these sites. On the way to the Ancient Agora we bought Loukoumades, dough balls that are covered in whatever toppings you want. We went for white chocolate. So good!
We visited both the Ancient and the Roman Agora. Both are impressive, but the most main thing to see here is the temple of Hephaestus at the Ancient Agora, one of the best-preserved ancient temples in Greece. Unbelievable!
Our last activity of the day was Hadrian’s Library. By then I had also purchased cat food that I had in my bag wherever I went, so a good amount of our days were filled with me feeding cats I ran into. Did I mention I was living my best life?
Time for our first day trip! Delphi HAD to be on the itinerary, so we woke up at the crack of dawn and got on a bus that would get us there. Let me tell you one thing: No matter where you go, a day trip with a bus full of elderly tourists is an experience you won’t easily forget. First of all, there was our morning break at a motorway restaurant where we accidentally left a member of our group behind, so we had to go back to pick them up.
But the absolute highlight happened when we were at the site itself. Two older women lost it at the tour guide because their headphones weren’t working properly, after which the guide spent the rest of the tour making snide comments about the ladies under her breath, but also still loud enough that everyone with working headphones could hear it. This whole thing was almost as entertaining as Delphi itself. Also an absolute must, by the way. The history of that place is beyond interesting and the view is stunning.
Our last full day in Athens. After a visit to the Temple of Zeus, another site that’s included in the Athens Pass, we decided to have a relaxing afternoon so we chilled in the national garden for a bit. We still had an exciting evening activity planned though! We went to the top of Lycabettus Hill to see the sunset, which was absolutely packed with people, but breathtaking nonetheless. When I say ‘we went to the top’ I mean we had to climb for about half an hour and then took the rickety cable car that made both of us fear for our lives so many times that I almost regretted not walking all the way up myself, which is saying a lot. The sunset more than made up for it though. It was a perfect way to end the day.
For our last full day we decided it was time for another day trip. There were several options and I still had things on my list that I really wanted to see (the temple of Poseidon being the main one), but we were also really craving a more relaxing day and we were both desperate for a swim. So we took the ferry and arrived in Aegina about an hour later. This is just a gorgeous island with several beaches, great restaurants and the best pistachio ice cream you’ll ever eat. The island is famous for its pistachios, so of course I had to try my favourite ice cream flavour here. Those couple of hours just swimming in the sea felt so nice after all of those activity-packed days. On the ferry ride back we had another stunning sunset.
My boyfriend had the earliest flight, so after dropping him off I had six hours by myself again. I also had my luggage with me, so I couldn’t really do much (not being able to leave your luggage at the hotel when you arrive before check-in time or when you leave after check-in time is definitely one of the downsides of an Airbnb for me). And so I basically ended the week the same way I had started it: by having a long lunch at Tailor’s House and watching the cats on Agia Irini Square.
I think it’s clear by now that I would 1000% recommend Athens. Let me know if you have ever been, if you would like to go, and if you will use one of my tips when you do!

My take on Athens, the birthplace of Western civilization and one of Europe’s most visited cities
Athens, the famous Capital city of Greece, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Continental Europe, and surely one of the most visited Capital cities in the whole world.
This is obviously the case for a good reason: Athens is globally known as being the birthplace of Greek philosophy, democracy and thus, Western civilization.
From a historic perspective, there are not many Capital cities in the world that come close to Athens in terms of Historical importance and sites on offer.
In June 2021, I began my Greek odyssey in its famous capital Athens as, for like so many across the globe, this city had been on my bucket list for a long time.
In total, I spent 5 days in Athens, which was just enough to see all of the important Archaeological buildings, sites and museums.
But did I enjoy my time in Athens? And is it worth all the hype or is it a bit overrated?
I will answer these questions in this article, but I can tell you that obviously, like for any other city and place in the word, there are ups and downs about Athens, and you should be aware of both before adding it to your European or…

An article about my visit to Greece, a city where historic ruins meet the Mediterranean blues
Athens, named after the Greek goddess Athena, has been a popular destination for travelers since antiquity. This bustling cosmopolitan city is one of the oldest in the world with a recorded history of over 3000 years of inhabitation. My recognition of Greece dates back to the early childhood days when I read the story of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian prince, who tamed the famous strong headed stallion as a young boy and later set out to conquer the world. In fact it was only after Alexander assumed power that the city state of Athens and the neighboring principalities conglomerated to form the country now called Greece. Alexander brought Greek ideas, culture and life style to the countries that he conquered and the marks he left behind during his conquest of the subcontinent are amply visible in Taxila which I happened to visit as a school boy.
I was lucky to visit Greece more than a couple of times and every time it was an experience of sorts, as the places transform for the better over the years. The first time that I visited the Balkan Peninsula was in the mid 1970s. It was the month of April and it was pleasantly cold out there in the open. We were told the metropolis had its first snowfall in forty years which was still visible on the top of Mount Lycabettus, in central Athens. The subsequent visits years later, in the months of July and August, were different in the way that summers had set in and the day time temperatures were some what uncomfortable. It was hot according to the European standards. Located between Mediterranean and Alpine climatic zones the city enjoys typical Mediterranean climate. The northern mountainous suburbs are usually cooler than the southern tip surrounded by the sea.
Ancient Athens was a powerful city state and a centre for arts and philosophy. It was known as the cradle of Western civilization and birth place of democracy. The heritage of classical era is portrayed through a number of ancient monuments and art works, the most famous being Parthenon and Acropolis, standing as the epic land marks. There are a vast variety of Roman and Byzantine monuments as well, the Temple of Olympian Zeus and Hadrian’s Arc to name a few. All these monuments are located within a radius of two km along with new structures like the Greek parliament, Panathenaikos stadium and the former Royal palace, all built in the 19th century. Ottomans, the last of the foreign rulers, did not leave too much of noticeable heritage and it was after their departure that the country became independent under a monarch, to be followed by a democratic set up in the times to follow.
During one of my visits to Athens I met a Greek lady, secretary to the District Manager PIA, who looked after me during his absence. She was there to help me receive my family on arrival from Pakistan. After we were through with our snacks she asked me about my choice of tea or coffee and my opting for Turkish coffee made her look visibly upset. Finding it difficult to control her feelings she very politely told me that in her country they called it Greek coffee, only to make me realize that with the long history of Turkish subjugation there was no love lost between the two neighboring countries. In Pakistan the Two Nation theory seems to have evaporated with the signing of (useless) confidence building measures and we are bending over backwards in a bid to please our erstwhile hostile neighbors.
Athens is a lovely place and it was a jolly good experience going places on conducted tours as well as at our own. We stayed at Athens Gate Hotel, named after the historic Hadrian’s Arc right across the road, and hardly fifteen minutes walk from the famous Syntagma square. Temple of Zeus stands next to the Arc and the expansive National Gardens stretch right up to the square. Syntagma, also called Parliament square, is essentially the tourist core of the city wherein beats the heart of Athens. It is an expensive area and a shopper’s paradise. The former Royal palace now houses the Parliament building and the old Parliament building has been converted into National Historical Museum, alongside the National Archeological Museum; all standing in a row at the square. During a visit to the British Museum, London, I was astonished to see a complete room placed in the big Greek relic’s hall. It was purchased by the British from the Ottoman rulers and re-assembled and erected there. Giving a soft touch to the place there are pigeons in big numbers in front of the parliament house simulating the London Trafalgar square. Tourists feed these birds and get photographed in the process.
The National Gardens designed by the first queen of Greece and formerly used as King’s private park with duck and turtle ponds and a botanical museum make an oasis in the modern jungle of concrete. Henry Miller calls it “the quintessence of a park”. A nice and calm place it is still no match in serenity and tranquility to the famous Kew Gardens in London. We were lucky to see a carnival, under way in the vast gardens, and it was a pleasant surprise to see the Greeks, young as well as old, dressed in their long and brightly coloured traditional dresses decorated with beads and thread work like that seen in our wild North. May be the invading Macedonians have something to account for it.
Ermon Street, a pedestrian road, shoots off from Syntagma square and is full of fashion shops and branded stores. Clogged with tourists at all times it is always a pleasure to be there. Language is invariably a bar for non English speaking nationalities. Once on the Ermon Street I encountered such a situation when a white tourist sought my help for ‘God knows what?’ Failing in his efforts to make me understand his question he frantically persisted with his queries and gave up only when I took out a tourist map from my pocket and waved at him. The sign language worked and he moved away smiling.
Shopping sans bargaining in Athens is not feasible by any means. The asking prices are staggeringly high. The Greeks are clever businessmen. You plan simple window shopping and you are lured into the store by the sales person. You move in to the store to look around and compare the prices with those back in your home country and you come out with ‘three bags full’. We walked into an antique cum souvenir shop near our hotel and were amused to see a coal iron put up for sale. The sales girl, seeing our ‘interest’ in the item, came over to us and started giving details of its usage some eight decades ago. We did not have the face to admit before her that it was still widely used in our country even at the turn of the century. We selected a replica of a traditional Greek chariot in the souvenir shop which, the sales girl insisted, was made of white stone. A year or so later my wife thought it had got dusty and needed washing and it virtually went ‘down the drain’ under the running tap water. It was some salt like material which dissolved softly.
The vibrant and multicultural Omonia square is the second most important centre located in the heart of the city. This area is cheaper as compared to Syntagma square and that is what prompted us to book a hotel in that locality during our last trip to Athens. It is regarded as the transportation centre of Athens. Mass transit system includes buses, trams, metro and suburban railways. Taxis are cheap and during rush hours it is considered normal to flag a taxi even when another passenger is already in.
The best way to see a place is to take conducted tours and that is what we exactly did. Some of the old and modern sites were in our walking range but for the others we booked the tours. Athens is a melting pot of architectural styles ranging from Greco-Roman to Neo-classical and modern styles. Most of the prominent buildings are from the Greco-Roman or Neo-classical era. Parthenon, the greatest monument of antiquity, dedicated to goddess Athena, stood on a hill top as an enduring symbol of ancient Greece. The temple of Zeus, the largest of the Greek temples constructed by Emperor Hadrian, has only fifteen of its original 104 columns now standing. The Hadrian’s Arc near the temple of Zeus was built as a gate between the ancient city and the Roman city of Athens. King’s palace is also nearby. According to a popular legend Lycabettus, the tallest hill in the city, was actually a boulder thrown from the skies by goddess Athena.
Panathenaikos stadium in the city suburbs, where first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896, was initially built in 330 BC. It sits in the hollow of a hill, where going up and down a couple of times you will easily burn out last night’s meal. Made of white marble, same as used for Parthenon, this stadium has a seating capacity for 60000 spectators. It is a replica of ancient Athens stadium.
The port city of Piraeus and the ancient city of Athens, initially inhabited around the holy rock of Acropolis, have virtually amalgamated with each other to make twin cities where it is difficult to draw a line between the two. The port at Piraeus is important as shipping is the other most significant industry besides tourism. Greece has 3000 merchant vessels constituting 18% of the world’s fleet. Though the revenues are gradually diminishing the Greeks still profit handsomely from maritime trade. Aristotle Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate who shot to fame after marrying the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy, after the assassination of US president John F.Kennedy, was a man with staggering wealth to his name. Besides Aristotle Onassis, Greece has to its credit the all time great philosophers like Aristotle, Plato and Socrates.
The Greeks claim that ancient Athens is the city with most glorious history in the world. It is a magical city worshipped by gods and people. It is an enchanting capital where democracy, as well as the most wise men of ancient times, were born. It is their country. They have a right to make any claims and there certainly is a fair bit of substance to their claims.

Athens, the capital of Greece, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It also happens to be the home of western philosophy. Yet most tourists are unaware of the significance that certain locations in the city have for the history of philosophy.
Friends, and strangers, who share my love of history, often ask me what locations they should visit there.
I am originally from Scotland, emigrated to Canada about eight years ago, but recently became a permanent resident of Greece. I’ve spent a lot of time exploring Athens, doing research for various books on philosophy. (My graphic novel, Verissimus: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, depicts scenes in the Ancient Agora and Delphi.) Friends, and strangers, who share my love of history, often ask me what locations they should visit there. So I finally decided to write this short guide to Athens for fans of ancient philosophy.
One thing worth clarifying at the outset is that ancient Greece ended up becoming part of the Roman world. In 146 BC, Greece was conquered by the Roman Republic, becoming a client state and later a province of what eventually became known as the Roman Empire. Later…

I rarely have regrets when traveling but my confession is that 24 hours in Athens is truly a shameful tease. After booking a weeklong family tour to Greece, I knew our stop in Athens would be too short but I was thankful for all we packed in within the next 24 hours…
After a wonderful Mediterranean style breakfast at the hotel, our first and only day in Athens began (where else) but at the Acropolis. The Acropolis is perhaps the most famous site in Greece, the legendary hill containing a number of ancient sites, the most famous being the Parthenon. For me, while the Parthenon felt smaller than I imagined, it was no less majestic and breathtaking. I learned the hard way (like, really hard) that the stones of this site are extremely slippery and thankfully I only fell down once, but this elicited a near stadium volume gasp from those around me…very amusing for us all.
After we were done at the Acropolis, we took a turn through the Acropolis Museum. It was not only aesthetically beautiful with lots of light and harmonious, neutral tones, but also had many historical artifacts you might otherwise miss out on. If you go to the Acropolis, don’t skip out on it!
A site that we also squeezed in on this day was the Panathenaic Stadium. I was very excited for this one even though we were only able to stop for a few minutes. The Panathenaic Stadium was used for the first modern Olympic games. This modern stadium was built on top of the site of a more ancient stadium and is made completely out of marble.
After cramming in many site visits from the early morning to the early afternoon, came the favorite activity of perhaps most every traveler: free time to explore. During this time we sampled some gyros (a must), a freddo (iced, blended espresso), did some souvenir shopping and went in search of one of the most famous neighborhoods of Athens: Monastiraki. Our hotel was a bit far away from this area but we managed to make it there, enjoying the stops along the way. The neighborhood of Monastiraki is thousands of years old and holds ancient charm in its cobblestone streets and historical buildings.
I first found Athens to be a bit congested and urban but this made for a striking and intriguing contrast to its ancient, historical sites that have stood for so many centuries. With the incredible food, sites, sounds and smells, there’s so much to take in, making the experience all at once exciting and overwhelming. But what ties it all together is the winning Greek warmth and charisma that permeates the culture, drawing travelers back again and again. Next time I find myself in Athens, it’ll definitely be for more than 24 hours.

Nestled in the heart of Greece, the city of Athens stands as a testament to the enduring power of history. This ancient metropolis, often referred to as the “Cradle of Western Civilization,” is a place where every cobblestone has a story to tell and where time seems to stand still while the world rushes past. Athens is not just a city; it’s a living, breathing museum of the past, a vibrant hub of culture and heritage that has withstood the test of centuries.
Rich Cultural Heritage
From the Parthenon’s majestic columns, which have witnessed the ebb and flow of civilizations, to the bustling streets of the Plaka district, where the echoes of ancient footsteps still resonate, Athens is a city steeped in history. Its very air seems infused with the wisdom of philosophers, the valor of heroes, and the artistic prowess of poets, playwrights, and sculptors. In every corner, the spirit of antiquity mingles with the vibrant pulse of modern life, creating a unique atmosphere that captivates all who wander its labyrinthine streets.
Unveiling a Historical Journey
In this blog, we invite you to embark on a historical journey through the ancient wonders of Athens. Our mission is to unravel the tapestry of time, to explore the city’s legendary past…

Welcome to Athens — a city where ancient history intertwines with modern life. Come along with me as I take you on a journey through this fascinating metropolis and share my thoughts on the emotions it evokes along with my flight and Airbnb costs to my trip to Athens, Greece.
Walking along the streets of Athens, one can sense its bustling energy and the aromatic smells emanating from its eateries. Amidst the savory scents and laughter of locals, I felt a strong sense of camaraderie and liveliness. Athens is the kind of city where every street corner seems to hide a culinary treasure, and every meal is an invitation to savor life’s simple pleasures.
As I wandered through the city center, I couldn’t help but feel disoriented by the maze of narrow alleys and busy squares. However, amidst the chaos, I sensed a constant undercurrent of contagious energy and enthusiasm. Athens has its own unique rhythm that encourages exploration and embracing every moment. The city’s vibe is invigorating and creates a desire to keep moving forward.
While Athens is known for its bustling urban life, it also offers moments of tranquility in its parks and green spaces. Being surrounded by nature, I experienced a deep sense of inner peace and contemplation. These green oases serve as a retreat from the city’s fast-paced lifestyle and a reminder of the importance of maintaining a harmonious balance between urbanization and the natural world.
Visiting the Acropolis was an awe-inspiring journey through time and history. As I ascended the ancient steps and stood before the Parthenon, I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of reverence and wonder. The sheer magnitude of this iconic monument and its enduring beauty left an indelible mark on my soul. Athens is a city that envelops you in its vibrant and ever-evolving embrace. It’s a place where you can’t help but feel alive, where the blend of history and modernity creates an electrifying tapestry of emotions.
I flew from Riga, Latvia, and the roundtrip flight cost to Athens was $300, and my Airbnb lodging was $300 for 4 nights. This article (and its video counterpart) has been a quick and simple overview of my time in Athens. Still, I will be creating in-depth and analytical videos on my time in Greece to help you make a better purchasing decision when it comes to planning your next European adventure, along with tips and tricks on maximizing your experience in the city of Athens.
My in-depth video on Greece is coming soon, so please stay tuned by subscribing to my YouTube channel, and if you want a sample of what my in-depth videos look like, watch the video below where I give my recommendations on Slovenia after my 30 day stay.

Athens, Greece, the birthplace of democracy, the freddo espresso, and saganaki cheese (all that is good in this world), is also said to be the motherland of graffiti.
The origin of the word graffiti is derived from Greek “graphein,” meaning “to write,” “draw,” or “scratch.” But moreover, the practice, as we know it today; to take to the streets to paint or tag, allegedly started with a Greek national in the US whose practice caught on and then made its way back to the homeland.
The accuracy of this tale, I wasn’t able to validate, but it makes for a good story, and with Athens density of street art — floor to ceiling, wall to wall — you feel that this must be the source.
In 2017, I had the pleasure of calling this ancient city home; soaking in the sunshine, the food and, of course, the art! When it comes to documenting street art in the Greek capital, the greatest challenge is that there is simply too much to accurately map.
One street in Athens can house more great art than an entire city elsewhere. So, I have tried my hardest to do it justice. I have broken my map into the main artistic regions of Athens and pinned spots where there is a large density of art, or significant murals to check out.
Use the map as a guide, but keep your eyes peeled from place to place, there is gold everywhere on the streets of Athens.
When first arriving in Athens, I was lucky enough to call this area home. There is a young modern crowd here with oodles of bars, restaurants, and cafes to be found. And, on basically every street, you will find painted walls.
Artists featured: STMTS, exitonwall, Achilles, INO, and Dreky the Pirate. Follow them!
Psyri is possibly the hippest neighbourhood in Athens. Again, bars, restaurants, and cafes a-plenty and an even richer density of street art. There is one street — Sarri — where you can find epic pieces from almost every prominent artist in Athens.
Artist featured: Yiakou, Achilles, David Selor, Vasmou, and Hambas.
I fucking love Exarcheia. If you Google it, you will see lots of talk about anarchy and riots. That’s not why I love it, of course, but I love the vibe of people who are passionate about fighting against the system if it is not serving the people. As soon as you enter Exarcheia, you’re destined to see political graffiti, Antifa symbols, and expressions of rage, as well as an array of murals, posters, and paint.
Artists featured: Wild Drawing, Olga Mavrommati, MOTA, and STMTS.

“Earth proudly wears the Parthenon as the best gem upon her zone.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
In May 2023, my family and I embarked on a memorable trip to Greece.
We had the incredible opportunity to explore the picturesque islands of Santorini and Mykonos. We saved the jewel of our adventure, Athens, for last.
There are direct flights from Athens to the United States, so we were able to spend a few nights in this historic city before returning to the US.
Athens is renowned for its renowned ancient remains and iconic architectural landmarks. It holds the esteemed title of being the birthplace of democracy and the cradle of European civilization.
Athens is also home to the Acropolis, which represents the earliest form of a modern society in Europe. One of the highlights of our Athens visit was our tour of the Acropolis.
Contrary to common misconception, the term ‘Acropolis’ does not specifically denote the temple situated atop the hill. Instead, it encompasses the entire hill, with the well-known temple at its summit being the…

People are always surprised when I say that I live in Greece. To tell the truth I have never imagined that I was going to live here… and neither when I initially came to spend 3 months was I planning to stay for that long. Three years and a half have passed and here I am. Before getting to know Athens and Greece I didn’t have an image in my mind of what I was going to find here, and in different ways and little by little the city and the country have conquered me. Today I can say much more than 10 reasons to live here, but I will just give you a taste.
1-Weather
Greece is in fact a blessed country for the weather that it has. The only thing that I would change would be to add some humidity in the air, since sometimes it is so dry that it causes irritations. Other than that, the seasons are very well defined and never reach extremes. Of course in the North it is more cold during the winter, and in mountainous areas. In Athens, the winter hardly has temperatures below zero, normally it is between 10 and 20 degrees until April, May, and then it starts to rise. It snows mostly three times during the winter, and normally it does not accumulate on the ground. During summer, the temperature can reach more than 35 degrees, especially in July and August. My favorite seasons are spring and fall, both with pleasant temperatures, although during fall it rains a bit more. Still, in general it rains quite little in Athens (in the summer we spend three months with the sun shining intensively).
2-Islands
Who has never dreamed of visiting the famous Greek islands? Or spending the honeymoon around here? As a matter of fact, the islands are one of the most incredible reasons to live in this country. And Athens is in advantage because it has the biggest ports and it is quite close from some of these paradises. It is very curious to talk about trips with Greeks, although many of them have never visited some of their neighbor countries, every summer they go to two or three different islands and they love to talk about what each one has that is special, and to compare them. In three years, I could already know some of these enchanting places, and each year choosing becomes more difficult, as the more you listen about the places, the more you want to visit them.
3-Safety
Ok, Greece is no Denmark, and organization is not Greek’s favorite word, neither it is law. But one thing that is very respected around here, is the space and freedom of each individual. Theft is common, as also in every other corner in Europe, but here we can walk the streets at dawn without worrying if we will manage to come back home safely. Athens, being a big city and with more than three million inhabitants, might not be the best example in safety of the country, nevertheless it is rare to hear about murders or general violence against people in the streets, and even the protests during the crisis are somehow pacific.
4-Food
Unmissable! Just with this word you can have an idea of the Greek cuisine. In the last three years I have gained some kilos (and I don’t complain because I was skinny before), something that in 25 years of life I have never achieved, regardless the place I was living. Yes, the food is delicious, and there is great variety. In Athens, besides thousands of taverns, you can find Mexican restaurants, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Russian and so on. From Greek food, features the olive oil, the olives, feta cheese and the famous souvlaki (the Greek acarajé, as I usually compare, with this delicious dish from Bahia).
5-Nightlife
Again the weather here helps a lot. There is nothing like a bad winter that makes the Greeks stay at home instead of enjoying the night. Either for dinner (normally after 9pm) or drinks at some bar, or a club, the Greek nightlife is very exciting. Athens has different neighborhoods that concentrate these clubs for different tastes, and the best thing is that it costs nothing to enter these parties. You only pay what you drink. For the typical Greek clubs, the parties called buzukia, you pay a more expensive entrance, but it includes food and drinks. And the night never ends, you only come back before 3am if you want to.
6-People similar to Brazilians
Greeks are very different from the typical European from the North. Besides being Mediterranean, they have mixed up with Turkish, and this mix has given origin to a joyful and lively people. They love gathering to eat and talk, spending hours sitting at the table after a meal. Besides that, normally they are friendly with strangers, maybe in Athens a bit less since it is a big city. They are also passionate about music and arts in general. The only thing that I miss about the joyful Greek life style is the dance. They don’t do it like Brazilians. Although they get excited with the typical Greek dance, they are usually not moving so much at parties and clubs.
7-Peaceful life
Even though Athens is the capital of the country, it has this air of a small town. Despite having great movement and quite a hectic nightlife, busier than other European capitals, you can easily find quiet neighborhoods in the suburban areas, like small villages. Having an older population contributes a lot to that.
8-Prices and courtesies
Greece is not a cheap country, but comparing to others in Europe the cost of life is interesting. You can buy a bottle of water with less than 50 cents of Euro. And to have a nice meal here can cost between 5 and 10 euros. Besides, it is very common at restaurants to offer free water and sometimes free dessert. Apartment rentals are also cheap comparing to capitals like Paris, and even cities in Brazil, like São Paulo and Rio, and, in general, there are not big social differences. I know, for instance, people working as maid at hotels and living in a very good apartment in a noble area of the city.
9-Cafes
Athens has cafes in every corner of the city. And it is a Greek habit to go out to have coffee and chill at any moment of the day. Their happy hour is much more connected to coffee than to beer as in Brazil. OK, to me, since I am not a big fan of coffee this could be a disadvantage somehow, but most Brazilians would certainly enjoy this routine a lot.
10-Culture/History
Who does not know that Greece is one of the richest countries historically and culturally speaking and that a lot of what we inherited as western civilization come from here? Even words from Portuguese have origin in the Greek language, and they are a lot! It is amazing to go around Athens and to visit the ruins and monuments, and at any place that you go to visit in the country, you will certainly find a piece of this history.

“Let there be light! Said Liberty, And like sunrise from the sea, Athens arose!” — Percy Bysshe Shelley
During our recent vacation in Athens in March 2023, my family and I made the decision to explore the charming pedestrianized streets that wind through the heart of the city.
Recognizing the golden chance it presented, I seized the moment to craft a photo essay destined to be shared with my dear readers.
A visit to Athens is essential to experience Greece fully, as it is regarded as one of Europe’s most iconic destinations. Often called the cradle of civilization, Athens showcases the rich history of Ancient Greece, highlighted by the magnificent Acropolis that dominates the city’s skyline.
Athens, renowned as the epicenter of the ancient world, offers present-day visitors an incredibly authentic and memorable glimpse into life from nearly…

Hello there! My name is Nick Iakovidis and I live in Athens, since I was a baby. I would like to take you on a trip to my home like no other will ever take you! I’ll share with you the secrets of my city, that gave birth to Socrates and Plato, and guide you through her streets. So, prepare yourselves for a great adventure and walk with me in one of the oldest cities in Europe!
We start with the most famous neighborhood of Athens, Monastiraki.
Monastiraki is the heart of Athens. You can reach it either by bus, train or metro, so it is pretty easy to get there without getting lost. Once out of the train station, you will reach the “Monastiraki Square” which you can see in the photo below. It is always filled with people, locals, street artists, and tourists from every place on earth.
See that church in the left corner? This is the church of “Panagia Pantanassa” (“Mother Mary — Queen of the World”). It may seem insignificant, but it is in fact one of the oldest churches in Athens, built around the 10th century AD! It was originally part of a much larger monastery, which covered the entire square. When the monastery was destroyed during the 19th century, the church became known as “little Monastery” or “Monastiraki” in Greek, thus giving its name to the neighborhood! Look closely at its corners and you will spot parts of ancient Greek pillars, which were used for its building, proving how old it really is!
While the train station is a common meeting point with our friends, family, or dates, the locals don’t like spending much time here. There are plenty of routes to choose from and wander into the streets! Also, I would like to advise you not to fall into temptation and sit in one of the many roof gardens like “360"", “MS Roof Garden”, “Anglais”, and “Citizen”, neither have souvlaki at the restaurants found in Mitropoleos street, near the square! These places are tourist traps and overcharge everything.
Instead, take the Ifaistou street and go on a trip to the Flea Market of Athens, also known as “Yusurum”. Originally created by Jewish immigrants in 1863, this market is where you can find anything you ever wanted. Vinyls and CDs at “Zacharias”, rock, punk, and heavy metal accessories at “Full Moon”, leather sandals and silly t-shirts, lots of hippie clothes, cannabis products, and souvenirs. Whether you want to buy a mini-Parthenon or a cool-looking set of leather boots, this place will get you covered.
But if you want to dig really deep while in there, and find valuable treasures, unlike anything else, you need to go to “Abyssinia Square”, located at the end of Ifaistou. Named after the Africans from Ethiopia, who settled there during the Ottoman occupation, it is where numerous antique shops are located. Here you will find comic books, posters, memorabilia, collectibles, rings, and telephones, all coming from decades ago! Here, laying on wooden tables in front view you may find things like broken clocks, old musical instruments, even valuable coins from 100 years ago! It is the perfect place to find a unique gift to take back!
Extra tip: every Sunday there is a bazaar of antiques here, so don’t miss it!
Are you tired from your trip and need a drink?
Then spend your time in one of the many bars, hiding around the Flea Market! Unlike those found in the central square, here you will have a great time, enjoying your drink like a true Athenian!
Need a place where you can marvel at the Parthenon while drinking your favorite cocktail or coffee? Then, allow me to introduce you to “Couleur Locale”, or as it is known here, “one of the most beautiful terraces of the city”:
Beautiful, isn’t it? “Locale” opened in 2014 and since then, it has become a favorite place for university students to party. Be sure to check out its signature cocktails like “Gin Basil Smash”, “The Surfer” and “Sleep no More”, made with gin and unique Greek flavors, like mastic, basil, and lemon. So, take your friends and go have the party of your lives under the attic night sky!
Perhaps you prefer a more quiet approach! Like a small green garden inside an old neoclassical house! Well, then say no more, and knock on the wooden door of the building right next to “Locale”. Don’t be afraid, it is not abandoned! It is just camouflage!
This is “Taff: the Art Foundation”:
Yes, this is real. Yes, it is in Monastiraki, hidden in plain sight.
TAF opened its doors to the public in May 2009 and since then it remains one of the most active and creative organizations in the city. It hosts a variety of cultural events, like concerts, galleries, and art exhibitions, all made by local artists. If you seek an artistic, bohemian paradise, right in the heart of Athens, you’ve found it!
Still, want more?
Then, take out your phone and prepare to update your Instagram! It’s time to visit the most instagramable cafe in Monastiraki!
This is “Ellyz Cafe”
“Ellyz” resembles more a pink paradise, straight out from a Disney movie, rather than an actual place. Once inside, you will find yourself enjoying your brunch on a cozy couch, while hundreds of flowers are hanging over your head. Its menu could make even Willy Wonka himself green from envy! Try chocolate pink hearts, creamy lemon tarts with flowers, and tasty rose cheesecake, which will melt in your mouth! Coffee lovers don’t forget to try a pink cappucino or a fredo latte with a large pink donut on top!
Extra tip: make sure you go to Ellyz with a friend who knows to take great photos!
Of course, Monastiraki is a multicultural neighborhood. Besides the above cafes and bars, you will find exotic places to travel you in faraway lands. Don’t miss to check out “James Joyce Irish Pub” (which is a personal favorite) and enjoy a Guinness with juicy chicken wings, while watching sports on one of the many tv screens. Or how about a visit to exotic Cuba? Seek the “Buena Vista Social Bar” and have a Latin party on its vintage decorated terrace!
It is time to share with you one final secret. Go to the end of Adrianou Street and start walking towards the centrer. In front of you, you will see one of my favorite spots in Monastiraki. On your right lies the ancient Agora of Athens, covered in a green dress of trees and bushes. You might spot the temple of Ifaistos and the Stoa of Attalos, graciously standing above all the others. Perhaps you might hear the sound of trains arriving at the station.
On your left there are the numerous cafes and restaurants of Adrianou, always filled with people. You will see elders reading their newspapers while drinking ouzo, tourists laughing and carrying their luggage, children loudly playing on the street next to people, who are selling antiques. A young couple might pass next to you, enjoying ice cream while holding hands, or a company of college students, eager to plan their night party at one of the bars mentioned above. You will hear Greek, Russian, and English, all mixed together in multicultural harmony. Perhaps, if you are lucky enough, you will feel the light summer breeze of Athens cooling your face, as the sun makes its way down to the West.
This is Athens. This is Monastiraki!
A Crossroads of Civilizations!

If real estate developers from 2500 years ago could time travel to present-day Athens, they’d likely nod knowingly at the Acropolis and say, “Location, location, location,” before immediately filing permits to build luxury condos with “authentic Parthenon views.” Perched 150 meters above sea level, the Acropolis stands as humanity’s most enduring architectural humblebrag — the ancient equivalent of posting a vacation selfie with the caption “just a casual Tuesday #blessed.”
This wasn’t just any construction project — it was ancient Athens announcing to the Mediterranean world: We’ve got surplus wealth, artistic genius, and we’re not afraid to use it. Also, Sparta, are you taking notes?
What began as a practical hilltop fortress evolved into Western civilization’s most iconic symbol of democracy and architectural achievement. The limestone outcropping that once protected Athenians from invaders now protects something else entirely: our collective cultural memory of a time when a small city-state pioneered ideas that would fundamentally alter human history — all while setting the record for world’s longest-running construction project.
The Rocky Rise to Fame: A Brief History
The Acropolis’s story begins long before Pericles decided to give it a fancy makeover. Archaeological evidence shows human occupation dating back to the Neolithic era (around 4000–3000 BCE), when our ancestors apparently shared the same appreciation for defensible real estate with good views as modern luxury condo developers.
The Persian invasion of 480 BCE brought a dramatic plot twist. When King Xerxes and his forces captured Athens, they razed the buildings on the Acropolis, providing Athens with what modern architects might call “an unfortunate but clean slate for urban renewal.” The Athenians, after defeating the Persians at Salamis, left the ruins as a memorial to Persian aggression, perhaps history’s first example of politically motivated construction delays.
The Acropolis as we know it emerged during Athens’ Golden Age under Pericles (495–429 BCE), the influential statesman who spearheaded an ambitious building program funded by the treasury of the Delian League — essentially repurposing defense funds for infrastructure projects. When allied city-states complained about their defense contributions being used to beautify Athens, Pericles essentially responded with the ancient Greek equivalent of “What are you going to do about it?” This massive urban renewal project employed thousands of artisans and laborers — basically the New Deal with more nude statues.

The crown jewel of the Acropolis is undoubtedly the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Athena Parthenos (“Athena the Virgin”). Completed around 438 BCE, the Parthenon embodies perfection through imperfection. Its architects built subtle curves into seemingly straight lines and tilted supposedly vertical columns inward — optical illusions designed to make the structure appear perfectly straight. Think of it as ancient Photoshop: reality enhancement before filters existed.
The Parthenon’s dimensions follow a precise mathematical ratio, with its 46 outer columns assembled with such precision that many joints remain water-tight after 2,500 years — which makes you wonder what these builders would think about your contractor’s excuses.
Next door stands the Erechtheion with its famous Porch of the Caryatids: six sculpted maiden columns who’ve been holding up that roof for twenty-five centuries without a coffee break or basic labor protections. These ladies represent history’s longest-standing case of unpaid female labor, though today five are replicas, with the originals safely housed in the Acropolis Museum (except for one “recruited” by Lord Elgin who now resides in the British Museum — an international custody battle that continues to this day).
The Propylaea, the monumental gateway designed by architect Mnesicles, remains one of history’s most impressive entrance halls — though modern visitors experience it more like an ancient Greek subway station during rush hour. Its innovative design included Doric columns (the simpler style) on the outside and Ionic columns (the fancier ones with scroll-like details) on the inside, a mixed architectural order that was revolutionary for its time.
Gods, Myths, and Drama: The Cultural Significance
The Acropolis wasn’t just a collection of pretty buildings, it was ancient Athens’ spiritual and cultural heart. According to myth, the site was where Athena and Poseidon competed to become the city’s patron deity in what was essentially the ancient world’s most high-stakes talent show. Poseidon struck the rock with his trident, producing a salt spring (essentially the divine equivalent of giving someone bottled water when they already live next to a freshwater lake). Athena countered by gifting an olive tree, offering food, oil, and wood. The Athenians chose Athena’s offering, demonstrating that even in mythology, economic benefits trump special effects.
The olive tree remained central to Athenian economy and religion, with the sacred olive oil from trees descended from Athena’s gift used as prizes in the Panathenaic Games — ancient Greece’s version of the Olympics, but with more olive oil and fewer corporate sponsors.
The Acropolis witnessed Athens’ greatest triumphs and darkest moments. When Christianity replaced ancient Greek religion, the Parthenon became a church. Under Ottoman rule, it became a mosque — making it perhaps history’s most overqualified religious building. In 1687, the Venetians bombarded the Acropolis, igniting ammunition stored inside the Parthenon and causing catastrophic damage — proving that using world heritage sites as military installations is never a good idea.
The most controversial chapter began in 1801 when Lord Elgin removed sculptures from the Parthenon — proving that with the right paperwork, even institutionalized looting can be made perfectly legal. These “Elgin Marbles” now reside in the British Museum, with Greek requests for their return continuing and Britain’s finder’s keepers position becoming increasingly awkward in an era of cultural repatriation.
Visiting Today: Tips and Reflections
If you visit the Acropolis today, you’ll join approximately 3 million annual visitors in a pilgrimage that’s equal parts awe-inspiring and sweat-inducing. Here’s what to expect:
Despite the crowds and occasional scaffolding of ongoing restoration work (which has been ongoing since approximately forever), standing on the Acropolis remains a profound experience. You’re treading the same marble as Socrates, Pericles, and countless anonymous Athenians who shaped Western thought, though they probably weren’t wearing Crocs or complaining about Wi-Fi connectivity.
The Acropolis’s greatest lesson might be how it connects us across time. The ancient Athenians grappled with questions of governance, justice, and truth that we still haven’t fully resolved. As you descend from Athens’ sacred hill, you carry with you a tangible connection to the birthplace of concepts that shape our world today.
Plus, you’ve earned the right to say “when I was at the Acropolis…” at dinner parties for at least the next decade — which might be the most enduring legacy of all.

Athen’s Agora was the center of public life in ancient Athens, surrounded by impressive temples and government buildings. It served as a gathering place for citizens to discuss politics and trade goods. Notable structures included the Stoa of Attalos, a covered walkway lined with shops, and the Temple of Hephaestus, which has come down to us as one of the best-preserved temples from ancient Greece.
“Wow, this place is a lot,” I remarked to my husband an hour into our explorations. “Everything we have ever learned about ancient Greece originates from here. This is the epicenter of the Western world.”
The archaeological site was remarkably green, clean, and well-maintained, unlike almost everywhere else in Athens.
“Dude, could you imagine if all these buildings were tagged?” I mused.
Ryan took a good look around and replied, “I almost can’t believe they’re not.”
“In all honesty, they almost should be, as a symbol of how far democracy has fallen,” I said, unaware of how much farther it still had to plummet.
When we were there in 2018, I still believed in democracy. However, as I write this, I’m not so sure I do anymore. The thought of America turning into an oligarchy wasn’t even on my radar back then. What was Elon Musk even doing in 2018? Sure, he was the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, and he was making headlines for selling flamethrowers and trying to rescue some trapped Thai kids in a cave. But the idea of him overthrowing the U.S. government and acting as its president seemed highly unlikely. Why would a billionaire even do that? And if one did, it certainly wouldn’t happen in America, the home of the so-called leader of the free world. Fast forward seven years, and now I believe democracy is a dying institution.
Although we do not practice democracy in its purest form today, even ancient Greece encountered similar challenges and sometimes fell into oligarchy. The term “democracy” literally means “people power,” and one of the most notable features of their system was the absence of political parties. I salivate just imagining a system where voting was based solely on majority rule, without an electoral college to alter the final results.
I used to believe in voting, as well, but that, too, is something I now question. However, it’s more accurate to say that I don’t trust any politicians — not a single one of them. No one I voted for is standing up against the looming oligarchy because they are part of it. They realized there was no point in pretending anymore.
Where there’s power, there’s corruption. I’ve come to realize that democracy is no different from communism — it looks good on paper. The realities of political maneuvering, social inequality, and the influence of money often contrast sharply with democratic ideals. Therefore, while democracy is often celebrated as a preferable system of governance, it still has the potential to fail. And when democracy falters, it can bring an entire country down with it.
The Temple of Hephaestus loomed over Athens’ Agora on a hill not far in the distance. The temple was originally dedicated to the Greek god of artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, metallurgy, fire, and volcanoes — more commonly known as Vulcan in Roman mythology. Visitors are not allowed inside; even in ancient times, ordinary people could not enter the inner sanctum — only priests had that privilege. The interior featured a large statue of the deity, which could be seen from outside when the temple doors were open, allowing the gods to “see” the rituals performed in front of the building.
It’s my theory that democracy has shut itself away inside this temple. Whenever the temple doors are opened, democracy remains a deity that citizens can only gaze upon and worship from a distance.
My books Memory Road Trip (e-book or paperback) and Time Traveled (e-book or paperback) are both available! You can also find them at most major international book sites.

“Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts and eloquence.” — John Milton
As our plane flew above Athens on our family’s first trip to Greece, the limited view from above only added to the excitement and wonder we were feeling.
As we looked out the window, we were able to see glimpses of the city’s charm. Clusters of rooftops gave us a peek into the vibrant neighborhoods below.
Although we couldn’t see all the finer details, the thrill of being above Athens, surrounded by its rich history and lively culture, only heightened our eagerness to explore the city in person.

“It takes a lifetime to discover Greece, but it only takes an instant to fall in love with her.” — Henry Miller
Starting my unforgettable journey through Greece, I’m excited to finally check it off my bucket list while diving into its stunning beauty and fascinating history.
Thanks to my travel agent’s help, who carefully put together a package including visits to Athens, Santorini, and Crete, along with accommodations and airport transfers, all I needed to do was book a flight.
I started my journey in Athens, a city that effortlessly blends ancient history with modern culture. As I walked through the streets of Plaka, I was captivated by the combination of ancient ruins and bustling cafes, which revealed the city’s rich history and culture at every corner.
During my stay in Athens, I visited the Parthenon atop the Acropolis, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. Standing beneath the ancient temple, I was awestruck by the sheer scale of its history and significance. The Parthenon’s towering columns and intricate carvings are a true testament to the brilliance and craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks.
To fully immerse myself in Athenian life, I chose to stay in the heart of downtown Athens. This allowed me to walk everywhere, making it easy to explore landmarks such as Syntagma Square, Monastiraki Flea Market, and the vibrant neighborhoods of Psiri and Exarchia. Being centrally located made me feel part of the city’s pulse, and I enjoyed soaking up the vibrant atmosphere that surrounded me.
“I want to have an ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ experience where I drop off the face of the planet and move to Greece.” — Jennifer Hyman
My journey then led me to Santorini, a destination that had long captured my imagination. As the ferry approached the island, I was greeted by a breathtaking panorama of white-washed buildings clinging to cliffs, adorned with blue-domed churches. The striking contrast between the pristine whitewashed architecture and the deep azure of the Aegean Sea was truly mesmerizing, creating a scene straight out of a postcard.
Exploring Enchanting Villages:
Stepping onto Santorini’s shores felt like entering a dream. I embarked on a journey to explore its enchanting villages, starting with the iconic Oia. Its narrow cobblestone streets led me on a whimsical journey, lined with charming cafes, boutique shops, and art galleries tucked away in every nook and cranny. The village’s crowning glory, however, was its unparalleled sunset views. Joining fellow travelers atop the cliffs of Oia, I witnessed nature’s masterpiece unfold as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of gold and crimson.
Continuing my exploration, I ventured to Fira, Santorini’s bustling capital perched atop the caldera cliffs. Here, I found a vibrant atmosphere pulsating through its labyrinthine streets. From chic boutiques to traditional tavernas, Fira offered a delightful blend of modernity and tradition. And no visit to Fira would be complete without a stroll along the cliffside promenade, where panoramic views of the caldera stretched out before me, offering a glimpse into the island’s volcanic past.
Embracing the Island’s Natural Beauty:
Santorini’s allure extends beyond its picturesque villages, beckoning travelers to immerse themselves in its natural wonders. I embarked on a trek along the caldera rim, traversing rugged terrain and ancient pathways carved into the cliffs. With each step, I was rewarded with sweeping vistas of the Aegean Sea and the neighboring islands, a reminder of the island’s volcanic origins.
Moreover, Santorini’s beaches are not to be missed. From the black sands of Perissa and Kamari to the red sands of Red Beach, each shoreline offered its own unique charm. I spent my days lounging on the sun-drenched shores, taking refreshing dips in the crystalline waters, and soaking in the Mediterranean sun.
A Word of Advice: Bring Comfortable Walking Shoes:
As I navigated Santorini’s enchanting landscapes, one thing became abundantly clear: comfortable walking shoes are an absolute must. Whether exploring the winding streets of its villages or trekking along the rugged coastline, sturdy footwear ensured that I could fully enjoy all that Santorini had to offer without any discomfort.
Finally, I set sail for Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, and a place of myth and legend. Exploring the Palace of Knossos, I felt like I was walking in the footsteps of ancient kings and heroes, with the echoes of the past reverberating through the labyrinthine ruins. I also took the time to unwind on Crete’s beautiful beaches with their crystal-clear waters and golden sands, which offered the perfect respite after days filled with exploration and discovery.
In conclusion, my Greek odyssey exceeded my wildest expectations, offering a tapestry of experiences that will remain in my memory for years to come. I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced Greece’s natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant culture. I know that Greece will always hold a special place in my heart, beckoning me back to its shores time and time again.
“There are two kinds of people. Greeks, and everyone else who wish they were Greek.” — My big fat Greek wedding

Entry 150. Athens, GreeceThursday, April 20
After some seriously rocky adventures on Kefalonia, I was kind of looking forward to heading back to big-city civilisation. The Greek islands have great potential but they can be quite hard work, especially so if you visit outside of high season.
To be honest I felt the least welcome of any place on my travels whilst being in these islands because of grumpy locals, over-priced food and accommodation, difficulty in getting places and the slapstick level of service.
Maybe it’s a Greek thing, maybe it’s just that they’re sick of tourists because we’ve been coming here for thousands of years. Whatever. All that has resulted in collective fatigue which means I’m in less than an optimum condition to write this entry about Athens, which needs to cover many weird, wonderful and important things. I hope I do it justice, so please bear with me.

This is the 5th article in the series — a collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB). Previous articles mapped property ownership-related patterns in Copenhagen, Prague, and Lisbon. In this post, we turn our attention to Athens, identifying parallels with Lisbon in how the city’s land management, ownership and built environment patterns were shaped in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
Like Lisbon, Athens together with its greater public interest have been significantly impacted by the Troika loan conditions, weak regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable groups, and a lack of data transparency in land and property ownership registers, although this is now being addressed through efforts to digitise the national cadaster.
This blog supports the argument that municipalities and state governments, just as the large developers and investment companies, play an active role in neoliberal city and country development logics leading to privatisation and financialization of the public real estate assets. It also argues that the European city and national governments should play a much stronger role in promoting spatial justice and societal resilience through land management rather than using it as a mere tool for profit and public debt repayment.
Athens has become the second least liveable city in Europe, according to a recent report “On the quality of life in European cities, 2023”, published by the European Commission. The reasons are similar to the issues and patterns observed in Lisbon, which largely resulted in the increasing unaffordability and ever-increasing spatial exclusion of its citizens.
Acquiring, analysing and visualising data on land ownership can be a powerful tool in comprehending the past, and current built environment justice patterns and their socio-spatial intricacies. In Athens, due to a lack of data access and transparency, despite numerous efforts, it has been challenging to precisely assess and depict who owns land and property in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions that could bring actors in power into the public eye.
We have therefore taken a desk research approach to finding data on major landowners and significant land sales conducted in the past decade, contextualising them within Athens’ housing landscape and reflecting on their relationship with the city’s future transition strategies.
The blog is therefore structured as follows:
A) Largest landowners
B) Major Land Sales
C) Forces at Play
B) Athens’ housing issues
D) Data transparency review — National Property Registry
E) Concluding reflections — Future city transition

2. Athens Municipality: The city of Athens itself owns a large portion of public spaces, including parks, squares, infrastructural land and municipal buildings (Athens Social Atlas)
3. Greek Orthodox Church: Holds substantial real estate, including historic churches, monasteries, and other religious properties, as well as land that has been bequeathed to the Church over centuries. (See: Reuters, Athens Social Atlas)
2. Foreign Investment Funds: Over the past two decades, several international investment funds have purchased property in Athens, to capitalise on the low real estate prices that followed the financial crisis. This includes hedge funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have acquired properties, especially in tourist-heavy areas or neighbourhoods undergoing redevelopment.
In the past decade, Athens has seen several major land sales as part of a broader wave of real estate activity, subsequent privatisation efforts, and international interest in Greece. Below are some of the most significant land sales based on land size and estimated market value, taking into account location (prime or less-developed areas), demand (tourism, logistics, residential), and strategic importance (e.g., port facilities, large urban developments).
Hellinikon Project (former Athens Airport)
Astir Palace Resort (Vouliagmeni Peninsula)
Piraeus Port Authority (PPA)
Marina Zea (Piraeus)
The sale of public land in Greece, facilitated by the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), has been a major source of societal outcry, particularly in the wake of the country’s sovereign debt crisis (2009–2010).
As part of the bailout agreements imposed by the Troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), Greece was pressured to privatise public land and assets, a move critics argue significantly weakened the state both politically and economically. This privatisation agenda, which often disregarded national social needs, was aimed at settling debt by selling off strategic assets such as airports, ports, and vast tracts of land. Projects like the Hellinikon redevelopment, where public land is being transformed into private luxury developments, have marginalised lower-income residents and reduced public access to urban and coastal areas. Local communities, environmental organisations, and political opposition have strongly resisted these sales, especially of large coastal sites like Ellinikon, which includes the former Athens airport and Agios Kosmas beach, arguing that the privatisations prioritise elite interests over broader public needs.
Politically, the HRADF’s operations have been highly controversial, with opponents dubbing it the “Sell-out Fund of Greece” and questioning the constitutionality of its mandate. Additionally, the low sale prices of assets, such as Lamda Development’s acquisition of Hellinikon for a fraction of its real value, have intensified public resentment, with many viewing these transactions as a fire sale of national treasures.
As noted in the Athens Social Atlas article, the privatisation programme fits into a long history of public land abuse and illegal seizures. This includes everything from individuals and companies encroaching on public land for private purposes to large-scale speculative developments by private enterprises. What is more, in some cases, this also relates to the opposite scenarios when privately owned land has been taken over by the state. The absence of a transparent National Land Registry, coupled with a fragmented bureaucracy, has facilitated large-scale exploitation and commodification of public assets.
The great article from Athens Social Atlas (2015), by renowned scholar and economic geographer Costis Hadjimichalis summarises some of the dynamics that shape the land seizures in Attica. He also writes that:
“The main reason for land-related abuses and illegal activities, but also for the delays in privatisation and sell-off by the HRADF, is the lack of a National Land Register. Essentially, due to a variety of factors, the state is not fully aware of the actual size and location of its real estate assets. Other than the lack of a land register, other important factors are the fragmentation of public services dealing with public land, the weakness or indifference of civil servants and the combination of political expedience and corruption.”
The recent development of a national land register provides some hope for a more informed and democratic decision process in terms of land management. However, while HRADF records its most profitable year, the rhetoric remains the same: “With a record contribution to the public funds as well as to the development course of the country, it seems that the operation of the TAIPED will be completed, and by the end of the year it will be absorbed by the Superfund” and “In total, the revenue from concessions — privatisations this year — will, for the first time in the history of the Fund — exceed 4 billion euros , an amount that will be automatically directed to the repayment of a not inconsiderable part of the public debt, contributing to its reduction by almost two percentage points of GDP“. This year alone, Greece hopes to raise more than 5 billion euros in 2024 from the sale of state assets, including a stake in Athens International Airport and concession deals for two toll roads, a senior privatisation official said on Wednesday — the privatisation logic continues. What has changed are add-ons such as “Decarbonisation Fund” and ESG compliance, with the support of the largest consulting firms.
To understand some of the further reasons behind the present spatial injustice issues in the Athens Metropolitan Area, one has to further examine the forces that came into play, prior to and following the financial crisis, as well as the enabling policies and regulatory mechanisms that facilitated their enforcement. These include:
Sources: (Law 2778/1999), (Law 4646/2019), (Law 4714/2020 — Article 5B), Law 4242/2014, Laws 4242/2014 and 4373/2016), (Law 5006/2022),
1. Housing financialisation a la Griega” — Alexandri, 2022
2. Social justice and a city: surplus capital and the remaking of Athens
3. Housing Crisis and Neoliberal Social policy in Greece
4. “​Platform — driven housing commodification, financialisation and gentrification in Athens
The dynamics described above led to multiple urban socio-spatial problems. Eteron — the Institute for Research and Social Change — a non-profit organisation working towards the production of knowledge and citizen empowerment through its
Project Housing360
provides an impactful overview of the present housing problems in Greece.
Property ownership in Greece is fragmented and often difficult to track accurately. This is partly due to incomplete land records and inheritance processes, outdated property registries, and legal complexity. The creation of a comprehensive, unified land registry system, the National Property Registry, also known as ‘Ktimatologio’, has been a laborious process spanning over three decades.
Before the establishment of the Ktimatologio, property records were managed by ‘Ypothikofylakeia’ (Mortgage Registries), which were responsible for recording legal documents related to property transactions, such as mortgages, deeds, and other encumbrances. As the Ktimatologio gradually expands, it is replacing the Ypothikofylakeia. In areas where the Ktimatologio is fully operational, the Ypothikofylakeio is either phased out or its role is significantly reduced. However, in areas where the Ktimatologio is not yet implemented, the Ypothikofylakeio continues to function as the primary land registry. Presently, the Greek government expresses optimism regarding the Ktimatologio project’s culmination by the year 2026.
An interactive digital map, with all properties currently incorporated into the registry, has been recently released, accompanied by the number for each plot. In adherence to data protection protocols, under both national law and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ownership details will remain undisclosed within the map.
To uncover ownership information, Greek Law permits anyone invoking “legitimate interest” to apply for information held in the land registry, which is provided by the Land Registrar in the form of a certificate or excerpt of the Land Book” (ELRA) — therefore the information can be considered public in the sense that anyone can have access to it. Each property is marked with a unique number, the so-called Code Number E of the national K thematic catalogue (KAEK), which is the exclusive code number for each parcel of land, the identity of the property. The interactive digital map represents the first time that each plot’s code is publicly available. One can purchase different types of information upon registration through a Greek digital system Taxisnet for residents with Tax registration number.
As this is a work in progress, property holders are still having the liberty to register their properties and update information conveniently, eliminating the need for physical visits to government agencies with supporting documentation. Though the deadline for property registration has lapsed, the online map aims to serve as an incentive for registration, ideally before November 30th, 2024.
After analysing Copenhagen, Prague, Lisbon, and Athens, it is clear that European States have followed certain common patterns in land management and real estate development. The role of the state and municipalities, often perceived as passive guardians of public interests against large private investors, has shifted towards active promoters of privatisation. Publicly owned development companies, such as Copenhagen’s City and Port Corporation or Greece’s TAIPED (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund), are increasingly used to stimulate economic growth and repay debt — whether infrastructure-related as in Copenhagen or tied to Greece’s financial crisis.
This system inherently incentivises the maximisation of returns on investments, often through the sale and development of public land into high-value, luxury projects. This approach prioritises short-term financial gains and large-scale developments, with little room for smaller, complex, or low-return projects, such as providing or retrofitting affordable housing.
While balance sheets may look strong, with institutions like HRADF showing greater financial returns, the reality is that profits are privatised, while the risks and losses are borne by society at large.
This raises the questions:

In the heart of Pangrati, I found myself surrendering to the most unlikely companions: the yiayias and their trusty shopping carts.
It was a tale not of streets but of wheels, where the clatter of metal on cobblestone became my guide through the labyrinthine charm of Athens. Each yiayia, with her cart in tow, was a living, breathing cartographer, mapping out the intricate routes to the neighborhood’s most popular pop-up.
I ditched the digital predictability of Google Maps and became an unwitting disciple of these cart-wielding mavens.
The market, when finally unveiled, was a testament to the wisdom of following the clatter and the charm of navigating life with a shopping cart as a trusted sidekick. The cart wasn’t just a means of transport; it was a companion, a confidant, and a symbol of gastronomic acumen. The locals, weathered and wise, shared amused glances as I, the outsider, fell in step with the cart procession.
In the gritty underbelly of Athens, the local market is a sensory onslaught. As you navigate through weathered…

Athens, Greece, January, 3rd 2023.
Yesterday, as a deceptively serene January sun shone on one of those poorly built streets of Athens, most likely hastily rebuilt after an earthquake, I found myself walking from the Acropolis to my hotel to interview Marlena for my podcast Stories of Healing.
On a side street of the bustling city, a man was standing on the sidewalk while another attempted to inject drugs directly into one of his neck’s arteries with a syringe. This unexpected encounter hit me hard. The compassionate teachings from the documentary The Wisdom of Trauma flooded my mind. I couldn’t help but wonder about the lives of these two men: Do they have families? Homes? How do they survive amidst such despair? The contrast between the seemingly timeless ruins and the rawness of the present was stark. The Greek government’s efforts to preserve its ancient heritage seemed unbefitting. Those marble stones will eventually come to dust without suffering, while this man was escaping his immediate pain the best way he knew how.
As I continued my walk back to this tiny hotel room, I struggled to find my inner peace, still bewildered. I focused on my body, straightening my shoulders and grounding myself. The city’s sounds faded into the background. Gradually, a sense of belonging washed over me, reminding me of the gratitude I have been feeling since I started nomading and that home is within me.
The interview with Marlena went well despite a few technical and practical hiccups. I pondered whether in-person interviews would be much better, with the added presence and access to more of someone’s body language and emotions. It was my first remote interview, my second interview ever, and I felt no stage fear; it was so natural. Marlena, being the sharp, vulnerable, and endearing woman she is, surely helped. She notably talks about drinking starting at four and those seven seconds of bliss.
I received an encouraging response about a housesitting opportunity in the South of Cyprus from January 18 to 28. The island has been divided since the Turkish invasion in the 1970s. Google Maps indicates a strange zone, a buffer of some sort, between the North and South sides. The red lines for borders I am used to seeing around countries are not there. And I wonder how someone at Google decides to delineate territories of contested land; it must become a geopolitical statement and one with practical consequences for a traveler like me: I am not sure I can cross from the North to the South; I may have to fly or take a boat directly to the South.
In recent months, I’ve struggled with short-term memory issues, but they seem to be fading. My friend Matei, whom I have known since high school and who has been traveling with me for the last few days, hasn’t noticed any lapses. We will go to Mount Athos together, that strange land where women can’t enter-the last one on earth.

Athens is the birthplace of our civilisation. The origin of our democracy and cultural hotspot for philosophers and artists. Athens. A place where creativity stands above money. A vibrant hub between the middle east and Europe. A place where people enjoy living.
No matter if you visit for a day, over the weekend or you take your time to explore the city, make sure you see one of its hidden gems and exceptional cultural sights.
But first things, first. Due to Covid-19 a stay at a designated hotel and a negative test followed by a 7 days quarantine was required to enter Greece. In case of a positive test a supervised 14 days stay has been necessary. Since June 15th Greece restrictions have been eased and Greece has reopened its doors for international travel. In the bridge phase till 30th of June guests from risk areas are tested at a designated hotel — again followed by either 7 or 14 days of quarantine. All other tourists undertake random tests upon arrival. From July 1st onwards the rules will be somewhat relaxed. Find more information here. With 190 recorded deaths, Greece has a comparatively low Covid-19 rate — one of the best in Europe.
Ok, now that you know about the common rules, let me tell you why my heart fully opens up when in Athens.
Come with me and I´ll show you my way of exploring Athens — where south african parrots guide you through the National Garden to the small streets of Anafiotika — sit down, relax, have a greek coffee and enjoy the sun. Discover incredibly creative Graffiti’s on your way to Acropolis. The view is breathtaking. Feel the oriental influence at the bazaars around Thissio and check out the Varvakios food market. Taste the rich flavours of greek vegetables and fruits and try a huge variety of olives. Grab a taxi to Piraeus and be part of the chaotic streets of Athens, take the next ferry to a pine covered sunny island and breathe.
This little walk through Athens should get you inspired. Wanna explore more ? In the following lines I will reveal my little secrets and talk about the must sees. Let’s start with my favourite cultural sights.
Besides the typical let´s say more touristy things, let me tell you about a few other spots that I love to visit in Athens, like the Varvakios market, the Stavros Niarchos foundation or the Filopappou hill.
Since 1884 the so-called Dimotikí Agorá Athinón or as the locals call it Varvákios market has opened its doors from Monday to Saturday for everyone who loves fresh local food. Immerse into a world of smells and tastes between Europe and the Orient. Let me guide you through the market hall and follow me on a short walk between fruit & vegetable stands to have lunch in a simple greek taverna.
Skinned goats hanging upside down, a cowhead staring at you, fishrow on ice, a smell of slightly old blood and a marketer screaming at you in a hall filled with active hustle. Doesn’t sound too inviting ? Well, that’s reality here. The market hall shows authenticity to its fullest and gives you a throwback to how it must have been 100 years ago. You won’t find neatly packed beef filets here, prepared fish carpaccio or beautified little packages of ham. It’s raw, it’s rough and it’s real.
What an experience ! Let’s continue our walk to the vegetarian area of the market that extends alongside the square. You´ll find a variety of local and seasonal fruits in the brightest colours and best qualities — varying according to the season. In between you´ll find stands that offer oriental spices and all kinds of nuts, dry fruits and herbs in bulk. So make sure you have some bags with you and fill them with whatever attracts you most.
After seeing all this delicious food, you´ll be hungry for sure. Enjoy a variety of greek specialities on small plates and share with your friends or family in one of my favourite restaurants — it’s so local that not even google finds it — sorry ;).
From raw, rough and real to amazing architecture & art. The Stavros Niarchos foundation is an organisation that makes grants in the areas of arts and culture, education, health and medicine, and social welfare that solely derived from sales of fossil fuels, as Niarchos was one of world’s largest transporters of oil. Granting $860 million in 2017 the Stavros Niarchos cultural center designed by the renowned architect Renzo Piano opened its doors to the public.
This modern monument includes the national library of Greece and the Greek national opera. A meeting point for everyone who wants to experience breathtaking views, state of the art architecture and enjoy the new greek culture. Inspired by the natural greek flora and fauna the surrounding parks are full of lavender, rosemary and olive trees. A fountain accompanied by classical musical played every hour leads to a path towards the sea.
From classical music to the highest of all goods: nature. From the lively streets of Athens to a tranquille refuge. From marble ground to solid earth. The Filopappou hill is one of my favourite places and for sure one of the most beautiful spots of Athens.
Breathtaking views to the Acropolis, Athens mountains and the sea. Sit on an olive tree and enjoy this unique experience with a bottle of greek red wine.
From one of my favourite places to the unconventional areas I love the most in Athens — from Anafiotika, a village-like neighbourhood next to Acropolis, to Exarchia, the center of anarchism to Omonia, an area to be developed. Let yourself be surprised by the variety and distinctiveness of Athens.
Anafiotika is a scenic tiny neighborhood, a tranquil oasis in the bustling heart of downtown Athens. Narrow passageways filled with small houses, bright colors & plants immediately bring you into a relaxed island mood. The village’s name “Anafiotika” means “little Anafi” and is dedicated to its first inhabitants’ home island. They came to Athens in order to work as construction workers in the refurbishment of King Othon’s Palace.
Meet Exarchia ! The most controversial, the most colorful, the most alternative neighborhood in Athens. This area is a creative and lively art hub renowned for being the historical core of intellectual activism. You can find a lot of restaurants & bars mainly located on Stournari street, also called the Greek Silicon Valley. The National Technical University is as well located in Stournari street and among the oldest higher education institutions of Greece — the most prestigious among engineering schools.
Exarcheia has always attracted exceptional Greek and foreign intellectuals, who lived and worked in the area. The alternative and artistic atmosphere is encapsulated in every corner, every wall, and every individual of this unique neighborhood. Famous (and not only) graffiti artists have left their mark and expressed their message for a more equal world.
Omonoia means concord. It is one of the most historical areas in the center of Athens. In recent years, it has raised a lot of interest from investors abroad, as there are hidden gems of unrenovated apartments in amazingly central locations.
The brand new fountain in times of Covid-19 lifted the spirits of the residents and upgraded the whole area. Further projects like re-think Athens show the start of a movement towards a sustainable Greece.
And after a long day in the bustling heart of Athens — it´s time for some drinks.
One thing is sure — Greeks know how to enjoy life. Their open mentality and willingness to celebrate where and whenever they feel like, is like no other. Here are a few bars that I really like and that I can recommend to anyone who wants to have a fun night out.
heteroclito is an one of a kind wine destination in the historic center of Athens. It´s a small place with a great selection of mostly local and organic wines.
Noel, a magical place. Crazily exaggerated christmas decor, vintage furniture and baroque elements inspired by Cuba, Paris and New York, all mixed up. A big melting pot, always crowded and excellent service.
TAF is an innovative cultural platform, that shows artworks ranging from contemporary, performances, film screenings, roundtable discussions and workshops to music projects, works-in-progress and pop-up projects.
Couleur Locale is a hidden gem in the narrow streets of Monastiraki. Enjoy a stunning Acropolis view and well-mixed cocktails.
The warmth of the greek people, delicious food, the sea and the sun. What more could you ask for ? No matter if on a cultural level or when it comes to taking a break — Greece offers hospitality at its highest level. After this little intro you tasted, heard, smelled, saw and felt Athens with all its beauty and authenticity. So, what holds you back ? Book your trip to Athens and enjoy Greece with all senses.

3 Reasons why I can’t wait to go!
Finally, after much umming and ahhing, pro-ing and con-ing; we have arrived at a winner…
Athens! (if you couldn’t tell by the title and image).
As I stated in my January writing prompt:
medium.com
I was struggling to decide between two ancient powerhouses:
In the red corner, we had Rome. With its beautiful renaissance architecture and awe-inspiring ancient monuments and history. A proud city, with a distinct culture and cuisine.
And in the blue corner, we had Athens. The city that founded democracy, and home of the famous Acropolis. A gritty sprawling mass of brick and concrete, spilt into the Mediterranean Sea, filled to the brim with character and delicious food.
After a hard-fought battle, Athens got its hand raised via a split-decision victory (Athens is a little easier on the wallet).

Carolina: The aftermath of Day 1 was a 12:25hrs sleep. Yes, you read that right, over twelve hours, and guess what? Even after all that sleep, we still woke up feeling like crap. Sorry, Mom, you're not gonna like hearing this but we were both under the weather. No fever but definitely feeling very much out of it, headache, body ache, sore throat, you name it.
Because of that, and because at this point it was 2pm local time, we decided to take it slow. First, we went out to scout some freshly baked bread. We found this bakery that was just a short walk from our Airbnb. Back home, we then cooked ourselves a simple breakfast: 2 eggs and 2 slices of fresh bread toasted in a panini press.
Two DayQuils after, decided that even though we weren't feeling up for the Acropolis, we wanted to do another museum instead. So we made our way to the Acropolis Museum, stopping on the way for some coffee of course.
Will: A broken cash register and a generous Grecian coffee shop owner yielded two free croissants filled with pistachio cream (I enjoyed those for dessert later as they were very much not vegan).
With a cup of coffee in hand, we proceeded to walk up one of the main streets in our neighborhood — Veikou. I kept telling Will how much it reminded me of home. For those who have been in Rio, it looks somewhere between Copacabana and Downtown Rio. There are tons of shops of all kinds everywhere. Camera stores, pharmacies, bakeries, restaurants, cafés, retail, home goods, you name it. You can literally get everything done within a 5 min walk radius.
Another thing that's very prominent in the neighborhoods of Athens is the graffiti. Not the art kind, but the tags (pt: pichagem). It's everywhere you look. It's a bit intimidating at first but it's a very safe neighborhood, mainly elders and a few tourists here and there. Pretty calm overall.
The Acropolis Museum is a gorgeous and modern building. At first glance, it looks like it could be a modern art museum.
The museum was built on top of the ruins of the ancient city of Athens. Underneath it, you can walk around an archeological site with signs explaining what each ruin used to be — a bathhouse, a mansion, workshops... We were the most impressed with how the ancient Greek civilization had a somewhat complex plumbing system with legit pipes and all (keep in mind that this is from the 8th to 5th cent. BC).
Above, in the museum itself, is a gorgeous collection of artifacts from the Acropolis itself and its slopes. They also have a very interesting video on the Persian destruction of the Acropolis in 480 BC and an explanation of how pigments were created using local rocks/minerals (see photo below) — yes, all the ancient Greek sculptures that we know now to be on white marble used to be colored.
After the museum, we went back home, cooked some dinner, and began our work day.

Before we set off to the Greek Islands for 8 days, we had 2 full days to explore Athens, the ancient capitol of Greece.
We arrived in the late afternoon on a miraculously on-time plane from London. After getting our bags we bought a ‘Tourist Ticket’ from the metro station. This ticket includes return to and from the airport and unlimited use of the Athens public transport system. It cost €22 although we didn’t end up using the metro much. Everywhere we wanted to visit was generally walkable. We used it 3 times in total. A simple return ticket for the airport will only cost €14, and if you’re only staying in the city centre for a few days you’ll probably be fine.
We stayed in an Airbnb in Plaka near the Akropoli metro station less than a 5-minute walk to the south entrance of the Acropolis itself. From here, we could get everywhere in the city centre in less than 20 minutes of walking. The centre itself is dense and full of incredible restaurants, historic sights, museums and shops.
Our host, Giannas, welcomed us to Greece with a shot of Ouzo and some recommendations on what to do in the area. We soon learned that Plaka itself is very much catered to tourists. Whilst very beautiful to explore, we couldn’t help but feel it was all just a big show for tourists. Giannas recommended the Monastiraki area for restaurants and nightlife. Our walking tour guide, Michael, echoed these same thoughts, claiming that no Greek people eat food in Plaka!
Good to know in retrospect, and painfully obvious when strolling through and all you see is touristy shops and restaurants. Although the proximity to the Acropolis was excellent and the area was quiet in the evenings. Everything being in walking distance meant it never became an issue.
We started the day bright and early with a walking tour with Athens Free Walking Tour. When travelling to a big city like Athens, a great way to get a feel for the layout, vibe and culture is to take a walking tour. Across Europe there are walking tours for all budgets. Based on experience, the free ones I have done have all been incredibly useful. Nowadays, they’re an essential part of visiting a new city for us.
Before setting on our way we grabbed a couple of macchiatos from the Coffee Island that was nearby.
We want to avoid spoiling all of the surprises of the tour and just give an idea of what you will be doing and seeing:
Our guide, Michael, was very well educated in ancient history and has a deep knowledge and understanding of Athens.
The tour lasted a little under 3 hours and finished in Monastiraki. We took one of Michael’s food recommendations and had an incredible lunch at O Thanasis. The moussaka we had there was the best we had during our time in Greece.
The Central Market is a noisy and bustling fresh produce market. The main hall sells meat and seafood whilst the surrounding area sells vegetables, herbs and spices.
We arrived in the early afternoon. There was still a lot of activity with plenty of sellers around. The seller’s area feels like a relic of the past and not the kind of thing you’ll see in a central part of a modern city. This authentic and local feel really adds to its charm.
Even if you’re not buying, wandering through the market is an experience for the eyes and nose. Although, if you’re a vegetarian or turned off by the smell of meat you may want to skip this place.
The Acropolis Museum is dedicated to the archaeological discoveries from the Acropolis. It can be a good idea to visit here first before going to the Acropolis itself. But either order works.
This sleek, modern building first opened in 2009 and was a welcome respite for us by the blaring summer heat. Close to 4,000 objects are on display here and there are great views of the city from the restaurant terrace.
Entrance only costs €5 and is a great stop for a couple of hours. If you can, hire a guide and you will get so much more out of it!
After some much needed afternoon rest from a packed day of sight-seeing we headed out to Cinque. This is a place to bring your loved one, sip on some divine wine and talk about your experiences of the day.
We sampled a bunch of different wines and shared a meat platter together. The owner explained the origins and optimal tasting experience of each wine we tried. We aren’t serious wine drinkers but I imagine a wine fanatic would get a lot out of this place!
The staff were cheery and helpful, and our names were printed out and placed in a frame for our table when we arrived. These little details are what makes a night at Cinque an unforgettable experience.
We recommend booking beforehand as it’s a very popular place. We got lucky and managed to secure a booking on the day.
Our day was planned around visiting the Acropolis in the afternoon. This was to avoid the mass of crowds and hot weather. We also didn’t want to get burnt out on ancient sites and monuments beforehand.
We both love Greek food and wanted to sample as much of the local food as possible. What better place to do that than Athens? We hastily researched where we should eat and put together a list.
First stop was O Kostas to try the best souvlaki in Athens. Or so they claim. O Kostas is a family run business that has been around for over 65 years. They serve a simple, old fashioned style of souvlaki for €2 each. An absolute bargain.
We both went for pork and devoured it quickly. It was delicious. We could have easily had several more! We had to leave some room for the other food stops though so it was off to get some coffee next.
The unusual name of this cafe stood out to us and good things happen when you combine art and coffee. This stylish spot was full of Greek people of all ages enjoying a chat and coffee. We ordered a couple of iced coffees from here as that seemed to be what was popular.
The coffees were fine. The space itself, however, seems to be the main draw. It feels hidden away and makes a great escape from the chaos outside.
Next up was sampling some Greek style pastries at Bougatsadiko Thessaloniki. The pastries are known locally as Bougatsa. We tried spinach and feta cheese and minced meat. Both were amazing and started our love affair with these pastries.
They’re a common breakfast meal and we had them often during our stay in Greece.
To put it simply, visiting The Acropolis is an absolute must-do whilst in Athens. In the summer months it can get extremely busy, like most of the big ticket sites across Europe. We were advised to visit in the early afternoon, as the mornings tend to be busier and by then the big crowds have finished up and left to eat lunch.
Another tip we came across was entering via the south entrance, which is closer to the Akropoli metro station and Acropolis Museum. This entrance tends to be much quieter than the main one. We lined up for less than 5 minutes to get our tickets here.
One of the best parts about visiting are the smaller temples and sites you can explore as you ascend to the top, where the visually iconic Parthenon rests. You also get great views of the city.
Our last stop for the day was the Thision Open Air Cinema. Located near the Acropolis, this retro cinema has a lot of charm and ended up being one of our fondest memories of Athens. It was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of exploring.
Tickets are well priced and so is the popcorn (and other snacks) and alcohol. There is an intermission during the middle of the film where you can stock up again also. All of this while you sit under the stars with the Acropolis in the background.
Visiting in the evening is essential, and we imagine it would get quite chilly outside the summer months.
After the movie we went back to our Airbnb for some much needed rest. We had an 8am flight the next morning to head south towards Milos, a beautiful island famous for its rocky landscape.

Whenever I travel, I pack my running gear. Partially because I might be training for an upcoming race, but also because there are few better ways to get a true feel for a town.
Running between different places gives you a more accurate feel for scale and distances, something you do not get from travelling by Metro or cab. The Metro makes short distances longer and convoluted, whilst taxis tend to take you through bigger roads, creating a barrier between other people, the terrain, and even the smells.
I enjoyed many things in Athens, from the scenery to the food, but to be fully transparent, the traffic and air pollution were quite off-putting at the beginning. I nearly convinced myself it was a bad idea to go for a run. Aside from the car fumes, we’d barely seen a single jogger on our first day there.
But looking at the map, I noticed there were several large green spaces with fairly little distance between them. So I created an itinerary starting from where we were staying and covering four of the major points of interest, whilst mostly staying off the busy road.
It is worth noting that many of the smaller streets are seldom used by cars, making them much more pleasant than the pavement on the bigger roads. That being said, the pavement is narrow at the best of times and full of obstacles, from holes, steps, parked vehicles, and cats!
Depending on where you are staying, you will need to adapt the itinerary. But wherever you start from, you can keep the general principles and loop through the various sites.
I first started with a large hill close to where I was staying. It is known as Nymph Hill, Pnyx Hill, or Lofos Philopappou depending on which side you are on (at least that’s what I was told). It is about 75 hectares and provides numerous trails partially shaded by pine trees. At the top, you will find the antique ruins of the Prison of Socrates, the Philopappos Monument, and numerous unobstructed viewing points of the Acropolis.
The national observatory is located on the northern side of the park, although I only realised this when spotting the old Doridis National Observatorium from the height of the Acropolis. This side of the hill is also host to the Pnyx Monument. It would be quite easy to complete a 5km run just by exploring the different paths available and going around to see the numerous points of interest.
From there, you can reach the Acropolis in just a few minutes, and run around it mostly on pedestrian streets. At this point, you might want to stop for a quick look at the nicely renovated Odeon of Herodes Amphitheatre situated on the south side, which is accessible without a ticket.
As a next stop, I aimed for the Lycabettus Hill viewing point, which towers over the capital at an altitude of 277m. To reach it from the Acropolis, there is no other way than going across through Plaka, where small streets are busy with shops and tourists, but few cars, at least until you reach the Leof Vasilisis Amaliasthe, which is the busiest avenue. On the other side, you can check the Monument to the Unknown Soldier before going back to smaller streets. At that point, you will have to slow down as the slope gets very steep and the run up zigzags through arid-looking cactus vegetation. It is a breathtaking climb, both physically and metaphorically.
My final stop was the Panathenaic Stadium, which is the only marble stadium in the world. You will need a ticket to get inside and I didn’t have too much time left at that point, but would have liked to run a few laps inside this majestic monument of a stadium.
On my way back, I went for a meander in the Ethnikos Kipos — Athens National Garden. The well-maintained paths are easier than the gravel trail on the hills, and it is worth noting that those gardens are flat as opposed to all previous sites quoted above. Even if you avoid climbing up the Lycabettus Hill, there is no avoiding slopes and stairs when running across Athens. Even though I paused many times to take pictures, I still felt the heaviness in my legs the next day, having totalled nearly 500m of ascent!
One final thought is about the temperature. I visited Athens in November, which was very pleasant and perfect for a run during the day. I know from friends that the heat during the summer is quite unbearable and you would probably have to time your running tour in the early morning hours to escape the beating sun.
Overall, it was a delightful 15km run, which could have been more effective had I not gotten lost a few times. But that was also part of the experience!
My only regret is not having had the opportunity to run the original 42km from Marathon to Athens, which would have been a cherry on this tourist cake. No doubt I will be back for that!

“Prosochí ton eptivon”. A message in Greek broke out through the intercom, pulling me out of my drowsy state. I checked the time. We were soon to land. I inferred I was listening to a seatbelt advisory. Having already fastened my seatbelt, moments later the English version came on confirming my intuition, announcing further that our descent into Athens had begun. I began pinching myself. I had been intermittently napping, but the adrenaline began coursing through me as I approached the land of my fore-bearers. I was arriving, but some part of me felt I was returning. Something was stirring within me.
Curious as to the plane’s relation to Athens I peered outside. Resting above the horizon was a bed of low hanging clouds. The plane was descending along with the sun, which casted an orange-peach hue over the bed of clouds. They were tipped with pink highlights. Fluffy like cotton candy. It was so peaceful. They were hovering over the dark blue ocean as if trying to hide the horizon. This scene mesmerized me. An island quickly faded from the view, supplanted by a mountainous coastline. Greece had already enchanted me with her beauty and I hadn’t even landed yet.
The intercom spoke once again, returning my attention to the cabin. I caught nothing. The phonology captivated me. It swayed itself to a rythm which enchanted me. Had my late papous, my greek grandfather, been beside me he could have translated the message for me. He would have won the hearts of the cabin crew members, by his charm and capacity to speak greek. He would have understood everything. He would be completly at ease. He could have taught me greek. I might have known just enough to impress a greek girl. I am sure that’s what he would have wanted for me. I chuckled.
I felt him near. I felt him almost beside me. I began to concentrate on the map of Greece, displayed on the screen in front of me. Particularly I focused on the Peloponnese where his father Elias emigrated from a little over a century ago. I placed my pointer finger over where I estimated Stemnitsa was, his village. I glanced beside me to the unoccupied seat and wished that he was beside me. I knew I felt him with me. He was in my heart, encouraging me and I knew above he was dancing that his engonós (grandson) was arriving in the land of our ancestors.
I arrived to Athens with no itinerary prepared. I also had no cellular data, so I was already in for an adventure. While this would concern most people I found it better to wing it. An itinerary impeded spontaneity I believed. I was to follow my travel ethos. Be curious and spontaneous. Befriend the local people and live like they do. The “just wing it and see what happens” approach had already taken me far. It afforded me a flexibility that I had enjoyed. It allowed me couch surf in Vienna and befriend two german girls in Portugal. Easy for a white 23 year old male, foolish enough to believe that he manifested this fortuitous timing. Granted it seemed like a recipe for disaster. Often the best moments of travel are the least expected ones. They are the moments you can’t reserve on booking.com. This is a central pillar in my travel ethos. Be present, be curious, be outgoing and learn.
I disembarked the plane with an excitement akin to that of a schoolboy leaving for summer vacation. My immediate objective was to find my way to the city center. With this thrill coursing through my veins, I boarded the X95 bus and seated myself. The man beside me put on his headphones, tuning himself out, but I wanted to tune in. Tune in to this wonderful sensation, this natural high of being in the land of my forefathers.
After taking a seat towards the back, my ears suddenly perked up. It was a familiar language. It was not greek, nor english but rather Spanish. Oh how that thrilled me! I tilted my head back ever so subtly, confirming that given their accent they were a spaniard. I took a glance back at a young man by himself with a phone pressed to his year. We made eye contact and I lingered by eye contact past him, as if I was inspecting the back of the buss to bluff my intrusive gaze. I turned back around, and cracked a smile. He knew I was interested in him. I knew I had to introduce myself. I had attracted a spaniard. It was only natural.
After he ended the call I summoned the courage to introduce myself. His name was Chevem (pronounced “Chema”). “Encantado!” I told him, shaking his hand. He was from Madrid prompting me to tell him, “Me mola mazo Madrid”. He was endeared that I knew such colloquialism. I further appealed to his sense of patria sharing with him of my travels to Madrid and my appreciation of its art and beauty. He was already eager to help orient me around Athens, for he was a tour guide and would show me around he promised. I felt he had been sent from Hermes. As if on cue, a group of tourists asked us what stop we were approaching. Chevem answered them in english and switched back into Spanish to continue our conversation. I felt this seemingly insignificant code switch affirmed my high level of Spanish. He was endeared by an American traveling alone, with an intimate knowledge of Madrid and its colloquialism. It thrilled him to know that I was from Boston, as he told me his close American friend Martin too was from Boston. We became quick companions. Me molaba mazo ese madrileño.
Soon the bus was approaching Syntagma, the city center. We got off together, as he told me his friend was awaiting him to drive him back. He did me a grand favor by sharing his celular data so I could navigate my way to the hostel. We left promising each other that we’d hang out.
When I walked into the hostel I felt like I was crashing a party. The place was buzzing with travelers. I waded through excited travelers drinking and sharing stories to get to the bar which functioned as the hotel’s reception desk. I soon learned it was happy hour. Everyone certainly seemed content, a group of travelers to my left were making a toast.
While checking in, a woman seated to my left answered my question about the Acropolis Museum I had asked the receptionist, informing me it was closed. She then to my surprise invited me to join her for a drink. Despite my fatigue, I joined her briefly, bonding over our common experience running cross country and passion for travel. Suddenly, I felt someone to my right. A women had approached the bar to check in. I moved my chair to afford her more space. I returned myself to the conversation, but with the new guest so close behind me I became distracted. Out of the corner of my eye I sneaked a glance as she headed upstairs, and a sense of regret lingered in me for having not spoken with her. Who was that I wondered.
Feeling hungry and the need for some alone time, I excused myself and headed out alone for dinner. The traveller who had befriended me offered to accompany me, but I politely declined. I was guarding myself a little. For some reason, remaining alone felt most comfortable. Tired, and perhaps accustomed to my solitude, I needed to decompress after hours of travel (in two days I had traveled through three countries).
Soon I found myself at a nearby gyro shop, just around the corner. I was spacing in and out while waiting for my order. Soon, I heard the cook call to me, calling me twice “Friend, friend!”. I turned around to see him smiling beckoning me retrieve the pork souvlaki I had ordered. It was delicious. I was to return here several times, for the quality and for the cheap prices, 2.50 euros for a souvlaki. The place seemed to be family owned becuase of the charm it exuded.
Not a few minutes later entered a young, attractive women dressed in all black. She was alone as well and seemed oddly familiar. She was beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. Black hair and fair skin. She ordered and went outside, I presumed to smoke. One minute there, then she was gone. Quicker than I could think to approach her. My mind, which had been in a state of dormancy due to the exhaustion of traveling that day, came to life. Had I been more awake I might have ordered another souvlaki and waited behind her to strike up a conversation. No, I thought to myself, that would have seemed to contrived. Best that I leave her alone, I figured. But something began stirring within me, urging me to reach out and introduce myself. Just as I had done a hour ago with Chevem. I ordered another souvlaki, perhaps to buy myself more time to think as she was now outside eating her dinner.
Time was ticking. I was mustering up the courage to approach her. Of course I had to. It would be disingenuous to my nature to pass her by without a friendly hello. Yet this is what I did. I left. I didn’t even look her way. She intimidated me. A few paces away from her I halted myself in my tracks. I can’t forego this, I thought. A fierce dialogue was taking place in my head. The voice of spontaneity and the voice, perhaps, of reason. On somewhat of an autopilot I approached her calmy and directly so she could see me. The next moments were a blur.
“Hello, I was hoping to eat with you. What’s your name?” My voice felt shaky as I spoke, and I barely had time to wonder if she could perceive my nervousness or if my words sounded odd before she smiled and replied, “My name is Lisa.”
Noticing her accent, I asked curiously, “Are you French?”
“Yes, I live in Paris,” she said, and my heart fluttered a bit. Her accent was charming. I took a deep breath and attempted my French: “Enchanté, je m’appelle Ryan, Can I take a seat?”
“Of course!”
It was that easy. It somehow seemed easier in Athens. Like it was the only city that two strangers could come together and befriend one another in the snap of a finger. Lighting a cigarette, she shared with me that she’d recently been let go from her job. She was taking advantage of the time to travel, clear her head and search for a new job. I shared with her of my travels through Europe. We quickly bonded over our love for Spain, has she had done Erasmus in Málaga, but confessed to me that she knew little Spanish. Her smile encouraged me, and I felt a rush of warmth by her openness and interest in befriending me. It felt like she too was craving some company.
She soon revealed her impeccable English, delivered with a delightful French accent. Typically, in the first few words, she would insert an “uh” at the end of certain consonants, creating a blunt yet charming inflection. Occasionally, she extended her “a’s,” pronouncing them as “uh’s,” a subtle reflection of her French background. She was already eager to spend time with me and began suggesting ideas. “We could (uh) go to the (uh) park and grab a café,” she suggested, her speech flowing melodically. The predominant quality of her articulation was the way her words blended together, allowing suffixes to soften until certain word groupings became nearly indistinguishable. It was so charming to listen to. She was a chatter box. “I think I have herdt of Boston yes!” she told me.
Not only was her company a wonderful, unexpected gift, but coming to know her that night brought to light the topics most dear to me: my family, friends, and experiences in Spain. Sharing these stories made them feel closer, and brought Lisa closer to me. She opened up about her family, too. With neither of us knowing much about the other’s past, I found such a warmth with her. My heart began to soften as I let go of the negative prejudices towards the French I had internalized from my Italian and Spanish friends. There are bitter rivalries in Europe and France is often on the short end of the stick because squished between all these countries. This generalized animosity towards them.
We put it together that we were staying at the same Hostel. And yes, it was a familiar face because she had been the women who checked in beside me. I had the sense it was her. We walked back together, exchanged numbers and made plans to have breakfast the following morning.
Going out the night before. Smoking for the first time. Karoake.
Within twenty minutes I was standing on hostel’s roof top marveling at the Parthenon. I was still on cloud nine, trying to wrap my head that I already hade made friends in a foreign city. A lot awaited me in that moment. I remained there for a few minutes, appreciating the Acropolis. I called my sister Alexis to her know that I’d arrive safely, and her enthusiasm echoed my own, fueling my anticipation for the adventures that lay ahead As soon as my head hit the pillow I fell asleep.
The next morning, after a restorative night of sleep, I woke up with an insatiable desire to explore. A breeze of fresh air entered the room. I stretched my arms and yawned as I peered over the balcony. The street was mostly covered by these beautiful orange trees. The sidewalks were covered with oranges. The apartments were all white. A cat entered my vision and darted across the road as a car approached. Awake too were the birds. I felt this street was inviting me outside. If every street had this enchanting quality to it I would be content with just a walk through Athens. I had no anxiety to google some generic, curated list of landmark, some “top ten things to do in Athens”. I didn’t need the internet to generate ideas. I sought my own experience. I sought adventure.
I found a table tucked in the corner of lobby and grabbed some fruit. Minutes later Lisa came down and sat down across from me. I continued to share with her what little french culture (music and pop culture) I had assumed from my french friends in León. As she went to grab breakfast I fetched my notebook from my room to jot down some notes as she had already begun to teach me a little french. I wrote for practice “J’aime Marseilles” sharing with her that I would greet my french friend named Theo, from Marseilles, whenever I would see him. Lisa responded “I love Marseilles too”. I made the hand motion that french rapper Juul does, which further endeared her. I appealed to he what little french culture I knew. She was delighted by it all.
After a pleasant breakfast with Lisa I went for a saunter around the Acropolis, familiarizing myself with the area and serendipitously encountering the Areopagus Hill. It is said to be the spot where the Apostle Paul first preached the gospel to the Athenians. I could see why any orator would choose the site, a prominent position where crowds could gather around.
Descending from Areopagus Hill my wandering took me into the city center past Syntagma where I watched the changing of the guard in front of the tomb of the unknown soldier, the n front of the capital building. After the solemn ceremony concluded I went and found another great gyro restaurant.
When I entered the lobby of the Hostel I recognized the man who I had shared the room with last night. I introduced myself to him and learned he was Mumbai. He was friendly and travel savy. We discussed how it had been uncomfortably hot in the room (which is why I alerted him that I creaked open the balcony door to allow some fresh air in). I told him about my pleasant walk I had gone on. It was peaceful walk. You’re not rushed when you walk alone. He told me that he loved traveling alone because everything is done at your pace. He was an agreeable man, filled with anecdotes of travel.
I was amazed to read a small kiosk that taught me of St. Paul’s passage through the area in 51 A.D. The Areopagus Hill is said to have been where Apostle Paul disseminated the tenants of the christianity to the Athenians. That was nearly two millennia ago. Incredible. A marine officer named Josh, who I would meet through the hostel, told me that Athenians, philosophers and politicians would congregate their to debate. It was spot I would return to several times, it wouldn’t get old. I went alone, I went with Lisa one time, I went with Josh and another guy to enjoy the view at night. The touristy environment almost adds to the experience. I practiced a little of my Italian with a family who asked me for their photo to be taken.
From the Areopagus Hill I let the hill take my down into the city center, passing through Syntagma, the city center, and the parliament building. Ahead on the side walk, I saw two soldiers marching towards me. They were dressed in a white garb with a red hat, a traditional uniform.
When I passed the parliament building, again on my way back, I saw the same soldiers guarding what I would learn was the tomb of forgotten soldier. I just happened to catch the change of guard. It reminded of when I was in Arlington national cemetery, witnessing the change of guard at the tomb of the unidentified soldier. We were there for the fourth of July. I was twelve then. Now, standing in Athens, I was reflecting again upon the valor and selflessness of the soldier, ten years older.
I continued walking, thinking about where I would eat. Soon I was seated in a gyro spot that I happened to come upon. The gryo was great. I thought they might have treated me to dessert because I was alone, but I would later learn it is customary in Greece for a small desert to be served.
After lunch I was in need of a siesta, and though tired I was curious to know this convenience shop across the street of the hostel. I was drawn to it by the little fruit stand, with crates of fruit and with bananas hanging. . Drinks, snack, cigarettes organized across the shelves gave the shop a cozy feeling. It had a charm.
I made the conscious decision to buy a greek product, a kind of greek oreo which caught my eye. How was I going to buy there, an oreo I had been eating my entire life? I returned to lie down in my little bed, curious as to how these oreos would taste. These were were the best I’d ever eaten. These had double the quantity of vanilla cream, it tasted fresher and cookie/biscuit part tasted a rich chocolate.
While munching on my third or fourth one (nearly half the pack) I came to discover that I was munching on the original Oreos, called in greek, Papadopoulou. This particular, more mass produced variant, comes from the traditional gemista biscuits. The Oreo I was accustomed too, is the american adaptation, the new kid on the block. The extent of the Greek influence is impressive, I began to realize they had their hands, they invented everything. After I had them, I began to see the papadopoulou’s everywhere I went.
After a little siesta, it was late-afternoon. I checked insta where awaiting me were unread messages from Lisa, who was curious as to my plans. I told her I was going to see a post-impressionist exhibit about a fifteen minute walk from the hostel. We decided to meet there within the hour. I revived myself and made my way over, hoping Lisa en route too, as I remained without data.
I had learned of the exposition from having flipped through a travel brochure on the plane. It was the first of many activities we did together. And through browsing the exposition, I learned more about her. Many of works were based on places with the French Riviera. We conversed about works set in Marseille and Saint Tropez, the later where her sister lives. She told me how beautiful those places are and recommended I travel there. I learned her father is an artist, and though now retired, was an art director (That’s how I would come to learn about Alekos Fassianos, a greek painter, Lisa’s Dad encouraged her to go see). In fact it was after the exposition, Lisa told me she wanted to go to see Fassianos.
After strolling through the well curated exposition we were curious as to what the other galleries contained. The only issue was our ticket was only for the exposition, not the rest of the museum. Though that didn’t discourage us from at least trying to enter the other galleries. We would only get as far as a few steps into them until we were caught, and asked to leave. We tried entering each floor’s gallery, hoping maybe one attendant would be more lenient than the prior, but to no avail. We laughed at ourselves. I did manage to recognize a Giacometti portrait which right by the entrance of the second floor. It belonged to his 1950’s, 60’s abstract yet figurative dull color toned style. It was silly of us.
We had a nice walk back to the Hostel together, where I left her for the day. From the gallery though the route contained its own gems. We walked past the first Olympic stadium and alongside a park full of preserved classical greek pillars and such. I took siesta and when recharged wanted to return to the Agora hill, where I had been that morning, to catch the sunset. With the luxury of time, taking advantage of appreciating the sunset was very important to me. It was a bit cloudy but I enjoyed viewing the Acropolis illuminated by light at night. It appeared even more impressive. The view motivated me with the time remaining that night to go to the museum.
With only an hour remaining, there was barely anyone in the museum and I felt that I had it all to myself. I progressed my way through the floors arriving to the top floor where I encountered the marble friezes of the Parthenon. The Acropolis was in view, the Parthenon itself stood illuminated, visible through the window.
Across from what video essay about the Acropolis. I was drifting on and off. Despite my fatigue and intermittent lapses in attention (jolting awake when a couple passed by) I learned of the tragic saga of repeated plundering and pillaging. I was shocked to learn, a French ambassador, in a bid to document the Acropolis, commissioned an artist to sketch and survey it. They ordered them to “Take everything you can [from the Acropolis], leave not the living or dead” It was shocking to see that written. That it still remains despite everything its endured is incredible. Wars, pillaging, yet it remains testifying to its sacredness.
The friezes themselves are magnificent, I was left quite impressed, proud to be related to a culture which takes great pride in its art and tradition (and the friezes are the union of both). They are remarkably preserved, and beautifully crafted, a testament to the talent of their sculptors. They depict scenes from the annual celebration of Athena such as chariot riding and processions of soldiers and citizens. Something began to dawn on me though, as I browsed, as I passed through the floor. As I saw gap after gap left intentionally between the friezes, I began to feel quite sad. The museums had intentionally left these sizable gaps between the conserved friezes to serve as a poignant reminder of the western pillaging that occurred through its history.
Lord Elgin plundered these friezes. This impunity is deplorable. One can now see in the British Museum.
The next day we went to see the Acropolis up close. Having gone to the museum the night before, I was ready to appreciate now equiped with the it’s historical context. That morning I used the panini press and made myself a simple ham and cheese sandwich. I added some apple slices, tomatoes, I sat myself down with Lisa. After a little ham and cheese pannin some fruit and coffee I headed with her to the acropolis. I attempted to use my NIE card, which proved my residency in Spain to enter for free but they caught me. She was let in free for being under 27 and a EU citizen.
She was happy to help me learn a little french it was almost comical the contrast that she spoke english incredibly well and I with my ten words in french was just hopping to add an eleventh.
As we ascended up to the Acropolis, we were greeted by the striking ruins of the theatre and the statue of Dionysus. The archaeological remnants left us in awe. A cat rested on some stones, welcoming us to the ruins. Lisa, enchanted took out her phone to take a picture of the cat, with the view of the theatre behind. She told me she would send the photo to one of her sisters, also a cat lover. We began petting it. It’s back was warm and soft. I told the cat “enchante” french for enchanted. It seemed like there was a cat everywhere in Athens awaiting to greet us.
The Parthenon was striking to see up close. I concentrated on the friezes, only a few remained intact.
Lisa led me to over to the smaller temple of Athena where I began to hear spanish spoken among a group of tourists. There were gathering themselves to pose for a photo.
As we drew nearer, I mentioned to Lisa that they were Spanish, having caught a few words. One of them had said “Venga” which gave me a laugh. Suddenly I was being asked by one of them in english to take their photo. I was of course delighted, feeling lucky to be chosen as I was already speaking to them in Spanish. “A ver, que guapos, que grupo” This enchanted them. I explained to them that I was an American studying abroad in León, justifying my decision (as I often do)
One of them told me to go along with my girlfriend, as they assumed she was my girlfriend, I told them the truth that she was my travel companion. One of them said to me “todavía” Lisa was a bit shy with them but she did speak a little Spanish to their delight. We ran into them a few more times around the Parthenon, and they remained enchanted by this fluent Spanish speaking American and his french travel partner.
I loved talking about French and American culture with her as we walked around the Parthenon. We were looking out over into Athens. Athens is a sea of white apartment dotted with ruins. Lisa, her french accent, was very beautiful to listen to.
We also ate a really lunch. There was this appetizer I was going to order but the waiter interceded and recommended I get the eggplant one that is made following his grandmothers restaurant. It was as he said delicious. I also tried Tsatsiki sauce. My mom loves eating eggplant so I thought of her.
Meeting up with Chema was a challenge in of itself. Lisa and I were heading out to Syntigama, where he told us he’d come too, but I didn’t have any data. We had to duck into a café by Syntigama square so I could hop on the wifi and locate him. After walking around a little aimlessly, we found our bearings and confirmed with him that we were to meet him in front of a Gucci store. We waited a few minutes talking about(I wouldn’t realize the irony of our meet up point until getting to know him a bit later). I was reassuring Lisa that her Spanish was good enough to understand him.
He began to take us on a private tour of the area explaining to us the significance. He was speaking in Spanish.
We met Martin in a plaza where an old greek orthodox church stood. They showed us this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant called Alvi. The food was deilicious. No signage, one would have hardly recognized it existed at all. There was no receptionist, we passed through a narrow hall which led to an open space with these small tables. A cat crawled beneath my legs. I was enchanted with this local place far from tourist crowded sites.
We talked about many things, politics, political theory and in several different languages. English served as the common language when we all talked with one another. Chema and I would break off and speak Spanish with each other. Lisa and Martin communicated in French. Chema and Martin ordered in Greek. I was their pupil, they were my professors and new found friends on that warm Greek night — sharing food wine and conversing in Spanish, French, Greek, and English, speaking the language of those whose hearts align in hope and outrage against injustice. I had an insatiable curiosity to learn how Chema and Martin perceived art and history, language class struggle, Karl Marx, and Noam Chomsky.
I was amazed that here I was gathered in this local, off the map spot, with a beautiful french women accompanying me on my travel, a madrileño I had befriend on the bus and Martin, sharing stories of Athens and being an expatriot teacher. I must have taken it for granted that there I could be in their company, a young educated man about his tour through Europe, a member of an upper class family, and at the same time, with the company of this cultured french women, indulge himself in the diversion of meeting Anarchists; and enjoy a delicious meal as Chema and Martin explained, that the Athenian anarchist movement still breathed life into the last stronghold of international anarchism — a city harboring the fading echoes of ancient Athenian civilization. Lisa and I were with them but yet so far from their every day lived experience that I felt this fraudulence for simply agreeing with their radical view. Their raw authenticity, that they truly lived as they thought, compelled an agreeable response from me — one that felt utterly uncharacteristic. My professors and their progressive stances then seemed so inauthentic…
They told us that there was to take place a rally the next day because Greece was to privatize its school system. They invited us. We told them we would let them know. Our hesitancy discouraged them. After all we were travelers, how much was their to expect to us? They took that as a polite no, but I felt part of genuinely considering it. This wasn’t your standard vacation.
After dinner we went to this cool bar and because it closed we went with our drinks and found a little bench on the side of the street. They were smoking and the subject of the conversation was about French anarchism and the French Revolution the revolt of ’68 and the realist French art movement like Gustave Courbet
The gritty nature of the Athenian streets enchanted me. There’s this certain beauty to the urban messiness of Athens that I came to appreciate.
I don’t think I wasted a second of my time in Greece, certainly not by walking its streets with the simple desire to be lost in them. The following morning I rose early as was my habit while traveling and stretched my legs around the neighborhood. I was already getting a feel for the area and felt somewhat adjusted to the rhythm of the bustling city. I was content.
A man with a friendly face was stationed in the middle of the street. A street seldom trafficked by cars. I had already passed him once as I ventured out from the hostel, and he gave me a smile prompting me to greet him “kalimera” (good morning). In fact that simple interaction had given me the confidence to say kalimera to others who I passed, and this simple phrase helped me blend in, giving others the impression that I was a greek speaker. This felt incredible. It felt like I had really transformed myself into a native greek. Their came a certain validation from receiving these greek greeting, although they were simple and said reflexively I had an enormous pride to be engaging with them through their language.
There I was trying to make sense of what this man was promoting. To my delight, when I inspected more closely the entrance he was stationed by I realized he was working for the Cafavy Archive. The great greek poet C.P Cafavy had lived there. I felt a rush of excitement. I immediately thougt of my Dad who had introduced me to his genius. The friendly greek man outside approached me informing me that it was open to the public. He could see the excitement brewing within me. That was a lovely interaction for us both. I was spewing with excitement. Something told me he didn’t get to many 22 year old greek American solo traveler’s getting this excited for having stumbled upon the archive.
My excitement was contagious and it quickly spread to the rest of the staff who attended my questions. They informed me that the archive had just opened and I had been one of it’s lucky first visitors. They all seemed eager to answer any questions of mine. I felt well received.
These kind of fortuitous, meaningful discoveries were somehow awaiting me throughout the whole week. As I left the archive after having combed through everything it had to offer me, I interacted once more with the friendly gentlemen outside. I thanked him and wished him a good day. There’s a heightened sense of euphoria when one stumbles upon something that had been latently desired.
The archive reminded me of the epic poem of his, titled Ithaca. It was the appropriate poem to mull over given the adventure I had embarked on. The poem is sung to Ulysses the wayward captain returning from the Trojan war. It’s the journey that confirms the mission and the mission that confers the journey. The poem would remain with me for the rest of the trip. As I made the short walk back to the hostel, I felt enlightened. I began reciting the opening line of the poem. The words of the opening verses characterized the spirit of my travel.
As you set out for Ithaka
pray your journey is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
The remainder of the day was filled with adventure and discovery. Lisa took me to a café her friend recommended to her in Exarcheia. It was called Lacantina and we had falafel.
We were amazed at all the street art which made the entire neighborhood pop with color. At the museum of archeology we were impressed by this painting which one sees as they ascend the stairs.
We met up with Chema who was gracious enough to continue to touring us through Athens. He took me a bookstore where with help from an employee I was able to find a collection of Cafavy’s poetry that I wanted to gift my father. He was soon to retire. It was essentially again a private, expedited tour.
The following morning I needed to get myself to Piraeus, the nearest port to Athens. I wanted to visit this island that Lisa had told me about. Unfortunately, she wasn’t feeling well enough to do the excursion and had to remain resting in the hostel. I didn’t have any cellular data, so I mapped out the route and trusted everything would go smoothly.
The only complicated transfer was when I arrived Piraeus, I was unsure of what bus to take to get myself to the ferries. I could see the ferries, they were probably a mile or so away. While I decided what to do I order this sesame bagel stuffed with cream cheese. It was delicious. I got it from the kind of café that serves you directly on the street. I loved those little cafés.
I figured I would take any bus I could get and that I could assess from there if it was heading towards the ferries. Luckily I hopped on a bus that took me to more or less the spot I needed to be. I found the blue ferry building and I bought tickets from a kind greek women. She pointed her finger to the ferry that I needed to take and told me to hurry as it was embarking soon.
I rushed over. Got on board. And made my way to top. I could breathe. The hard part was over. I decided to take in the sun and rest a while.
After a short rest I wanted to walk around the ferry. It wasn’t so crowded. I found a corner where I could seclude myself and obtain a view of the ocean. It was msrvillous. The sea was shiny, glistening from the bright sun. I felt somewhat the sun made the blue of the ocean appear lighter, almost more vivid. I am not sure what the effect what but I felt my sense of vision improve itself. It was stunning to watch us approach these islands.
A women politely asked me if I could take picture of her and her daughter, pulling me from the hypnotizing effect of the sea. She was celebrating her fiftieth birthday by taking a trip with her daughter. I wished her a happy birthday.
I walked over with her to meet her daughter. There was something so warm about her that reminded of my mother. She called “my darling”. I was suddenly taken by their openess and warmth. They lived in London and spoke english with the British accent. Madu was a nurse and was born in Sri Lanka, a country unfortunately plagued with political violence.
Her daughter was my age and soon to graduate college. She wanted to become a doctor. I found her accent so charming. Their company and conversation quickened the ride and after talking about my year abroad, my family, America, politics and contemporary issues the ferry was already soon to dock. We soon parted ways and confirmed that we would see each other again on the return trip.
It didn’t take long for the island to enamor me. A charming little church greeted us on the dock. I had never seen a church on a dock before. Its white exterior seemed to glow ever strong with the sun’s pounding radiance. The sun warmed my spirit.
As I made my way through the town it easy to identify who and who wasn’t a local. There were tons locals riding motorcycles, the most comfortable mode of transport I figured. While they were in the middle of their errands, while travelers criss crossed the roads, impeding the flow of this slow paced island life. Even the signs enchanted me, as everything felt simpler, more elemental. I popped into greek orthodox churches and paused to take photos.
I didn’t know where I was going. I figured I would stick to the coast line and follow it. An hour had passed and I realized I was no where near the little village I had ventured out to see. The island was far bigger than I had estimated.
That’s when the courage came upon me to stick out my thumb and see if I could hitch hike, to really test the friendliness and openness of the greek people.
There was already a truck departing near me from this road I was coming from. When I held out my thumb and pointed with my other hand left the truck driver who I’d said , no he said greek and I instinctively said what he told me back he pointed the other way. Essentially he through his hands communicated that he was headed the opposite way.
The next car which drove by was this older mean who I saw was wearing a mask who politely acknowledged my request but politely declined touching his mask as to indicate de didn’t feel well. He didn’t want to contaminate me. Two cars later came Stavros who pulled ahead of me and scrambled to clear the passenger seat of some kind of bird cage. He was eager to have me. I didn’t even know exactly where I wanted to go, which didn’t seem to suprise him. I trust him and he assumed my destination was the next port which was where I intuitively was heading.
The seatbelt didn’t quite click activating an alarm. I had to hold it the buckle in place to cancel the alarm. We chatted for a brief five minutes and he taught me a little greek and he was delighted to hear that I, being American, had greek ethnic heritage. It was easy to impress him with phrases like “Christos anesti” “Opa!”. I thought he had a simple soul, so impressionable by my limited showing of greek. He was happy for me. I could tell that. It seemed like of all the people on the island and it was him who was awaiting for me to meet him. Something about the trust we had both in each other to go through with the hitch hike made the connection seemingly more profound.
By then it was early afternoon and the island became even more beautiful somehow. Time seemed to slow itself in this little enchanting port. Stavros had dropped me off and went about his errands.
There seemed to be more cats than humans.
I went through the village’s quiet streets. It was apparent I was the only tourist which felt odd. After wandering through the little port which didn’t take to long to fully know, I found a bench and sat myself down on the left side and within a second it collapsed under my weight. A few women behind me chucked and smiled at me, as I brought myself to my feet. Had I known greek I could have connected with them further. But the moment we shared was sufficient enough to express everything it held, the clumsiness and silliness of sitting in a bench that collapses beneath you. I tried to reassemble the bench but one of the green beam came out when I pulled it. Then I began to laugh and it felt so great to laugh as I walk away from the pile of beams that once was a bench.
Farther along the road I found a little rocky point along the coastline of ηέρδικλ to pause to reflect on the day, recording some thoughts in my travel journal. I recorded some of Cafavy’s poetry. As I gazed across the ocean toward the island, it felt as though the entire spectrum of blue had come alive before me — each shade represented. The sky and sea seemed to blend into one infinite canvas, every pigment of blue imaginable dancing between them. I closed my eyes momentarily, letting the first glimmer of sight settle in my mind, only to open them again, just to remind myself it was real.
Before me stretched a shimmering path, reaching across the ocean out into the horizon beneath the sun’s embrace. The gentle chirping of birds filled the air, weaving themselves into the rhythm of the waves. In that moment, I was utterly still, wholly content, and wonderfully alive.
I was so content.
I was in a state of atraxia, a state of tranquility and equanimity, free from worry and distress. Atraxia is derived from the Greek words a-, meaning “not”, and tarassein, meaning “to disturb or confuse”. Epicureans sought ataraxia as the highest goal and considered it to be true happiness.
After a brief stint of reflection I sat myself down at a calm restaurant for a late lunch. Everything I had was so fresh and delicious.
I was seated contemplating what I wanted to choose for dessert. I was going to receive a customary dessert and was given the option. A lady across from was ease dropping and interceded for me. She was an elderly women who insisted that I try a certain dessert. Of course, I obliged and went with her recommendation. She and her husband were retired greek Americans who had recently made the island their home. They told me how peaceful it was to live there. They soon gained my trust. It gave them joy to know I was greek American. They took me under their wing and expressed their concern that I was not going to make the ferry on time. I was so relaxed it would not have stressed me to coordinate how I was ever to make it back on time with no ride. They told me they would bring me.
First they wanted to show me the island. They had fallen in love with their new home. They had friends through the island and as we passed their home they shared with me anecdotes of the friendliness of their neighbors. I was impressed by how concentrated the island was with these tiny churches. Bella told me there were 360 churches dotted across the island. They explained to me that the island was home to the monastery of a greek Saint named Agios Nectarios, also known as the Wonderworker of Aegina. He was miracle healer who is considered the patron saint of people with cancer, heart disease, arthritis, epilepsy, and other illnesses. Dino told me: “and give his money to the poor people whatever money they give”
They drove me through the winding roads of the island and brought me to see the monastery, one of the most visited sites on Aegina. The monastery grounds include a large church and a small chapel where St. Nectarios’ tomb is located. Thousands of pilgrims come to the island every year they told me to honor him. They were devout greek orthodox christians and their faith inspired me. They spoke so simply. “Follow your grandfather, it makes sense” Dino said to me. He implored me to become greek orthodox.
As we zipped towards the main port I felt an incredible desire to rekindle my sense of pride in being greek. I felt an incredible honor to share ancestry with these humble simple people. I expressed to them my desire to buy pistachios. The island was known for its pistachios. They dropped me off near a pistachio vendor. I had a hour to kill and wanted also to explore the nearby marketplace. There was a fish market and other stores that I bopped into. I came across an artist selling his drawings. I stopped to appreciate his artwork. He drew on whatever he could find, scraps of paper and this captivated me. He read my interest and gave me a price. I confessed to him that I didn’t have much cash and we negotiated a price for a few drawings. I was thankful. I complimented him. He told me he was a Belgian but the art world disillusioned him and he left to find a simpler way of life. He felt he had become creatively a slave to his patrons and yearned to have the freedom to create as he pleased. He had a lucrative career in Antwerp, but walked away from all the money to rediscover his happiness. I found that admirable.
Then as I was walking away from him to my delight a fish vendor called to me signaling that Madu was chasing me down. I didn’t know that she was seated at a nearby restaurant, and through a window had spotted me speaking with the artist. She invited me into the restaurant and asked if I was hungry. I politely told them I was good but appreciated their generosity. I could tell they really enjoyed my presence, which made them already feel like family to me. It’s amazing how quickly you can bond with strangers through this particular feeling.
I also had gone into other merchant’s shops. I tried baklava. The sweet crunchy flakey dessert. Its origins are contested amongst the Greeks, Turks and Lebanese with some saying it originated in Persia. The store owners were very kind to me. They exuded kindness as had everyone on the island.
Later that night I return to Athens via the metro with Madu and her daughter. It was a pleasant return. Lisa awaited me and we went out for dinner. It was a magical day. I was reflecting and treasuring the experiences I was having, bringing them deep within my heart.
I arose after a restorative sleep somewhat on the later side. When I came down to the hostel lobby I found Tristan, the guy from Maine I had befriended. He was seated at the bar and I told him it was Joshua Laurence a chamberlain the colonel who defended the union left flank at Gettysburg. He was a history buff like me and I appealed to his Maine nativity. He was excited at what I had learned. After hours of fighting they ran out of ammunition so Chamberlin ordered a bayonet charge. The line prevailed and the Union army won the battle. The night before we were talking about the civil war and how he grew up attending St. George a private school where Rucker Carlson’s kids attended. He knew Bobby. He loved sailing. We enjoy several chats together. He was one of many people I so easily bonded with that week.
Lisa came down for breakfast and I excused myself from Tristan to greet her. We ate breakfast together and I showed her the art I bought from Chem the migrant Dutch artist on Aegina. Lisa and I had only more or less of an idea for our itinerary. We tossed out ideas, while trying some of the delicacies I had procured from the island. We tried the pistachio wafers fillers with this pistachio butter cream. They were really rich almost too much I joked. I even gave one to Josh who also was at breakfast. I recommended he go to the island and gave him the run down. He was there in Greece on leave from his military service. He was a greek orthodox and was excited to explore all the churches. Aegina would be great. I told him of my travel and he seemed eager to go. He in return recommended I go to Socrates prison.
Lisa and I went to yesterdays bread where I bought a nice vintage flannel. We’ve really had all this time this week to get to know each other. I’ve been following the story of her job situation and prospects marketing this French purse brand. Her first interview went well and today she met with the HR women to discuss salary. The final interview is this Monday so I’m praying that she gets it. The consequences weren’t that grave if she doesn’t get. In fact it would free her schedule allowing her to join her family in the Pyrenees to ski. It impressed me that she express these conflicting feeling in english so fluently.
After a little thrift shopping and Lisa’s fashion advice, we went out separate ways her to the interview and to the Alekos Fassianos exhibit. You realize here that people walk very nonchalantly. It’s a beautiful neighborhood. It’s quite sad that the center park is occupied. The federal government is planning to build a metro in Exarchia even though the referendum BU the locals was overwhelmingly against it.
The Fassianos exhibit was this hole in the wall place. There was no signage indicating where it was. I arrived and someone was scavenging through trash directly outside. I had the good fortune of arriving when a Greek women did too. I could tell she was also confused and asked her. She went into a convenience store where with the owner she asked. We eventually found it but I kind of piggybacked off her Greek to find it. I might not have found it without her presence, even though it was hidden in plain day. It was odd.
The exhibit was great. I really liked his style. It’s Picassoesque but very much his own. I particularly liked the one of Hermes on the bicycle. The greek God of messages is depicted on a bike, which I thought was quite suiting. His color palette too is so beautiful. I like the little details he incorporates into the background of his painting. Churches and often appear in his works. I must have spent a hour soaking in everything I could about the artist. I even bought some of his postals.
I had learned of him through the Lisa’s Dad who recommended she go. He was an art director teacher and continues to paint teaching a class to newly arrived immigrants. He draws a lot of nudes. Lisa actually doesn’t like his style which was a very honest confession. But she of courses loves him and the other day she called him while we were walking to get his advice. (How are you in French is pronounced more like saw va)
When I met up with Lisa after it was at six dogs a cafe besides a tattoo parlor that seemed good. I had been expressing to her my desire to get one and she encouraged me. The tatoo artist was named Bill. Bill was like always go with the women’s advice bc I though to get the smaller one. I got my first tattoo of the word Arete. Greek rap was playing in the back. I was nervous. Having Lisa there meant a lot to I think she really was encouraging. I got it tatted behind my elbow the the ancient greek word Αρετή — “arete”. It’s a beautiful word which translates to having excellence in all facets of life. It means to strive to achieve excellence in the moral, physical and mental spaces of one’s life. But beyond its translation, I’ll dive later into the meaning of the tattoo.
That night Lisa and I left the hostel to go see the sunset over Athens. We went to the Areopagus hill which is said to be where St. Paul preached the gospel to the Athenians. The view was beautiful of the city. The acropolis and everything was super pretty. Lisa and I agreed it’s better to have about a week to get to know a city like about the size of Athens. You’re not rushed and you can really get to all the areas, even the non tourist areas.
Martin recommended we go see it from here: His footnote to the link was “Go to the basketball courts then climb up the hill” https://maps.app.goo.gl/7xyos2vv716bxahg6?g_st=iw
After the sunset we met Martin at the Omonio metro station. From there we walked to a restaurant in a neighborhood he told us is starting to become trendy but still not known by tourists. That’s always music to my ears, I am always conscience of my effort to experience the authentic neighborhoods of a place. Around the hostel and Acropolis is the tourist friendly district.
Martin took us to a restaurant called Exodus Kafeneio. Martin ordered three beers for us in Greek. The waiter was friendly, Martin is considerate too he wanted to ensure we had the seats which faced the street. We were there sipping our mythos thanks to him. I relished this pork in wine and pepper sauce dish and tried some of what Martin got Turkish tortellini (tortellini with beef, cow butter, yogurt and garlic sauce, chili pepper flakes) it was great.
Martin opened up to us about his book project which is about this person who is searching for a lost artist across Detroit and Greece. He was telling us about how little the teachers are paid and many teachers work and come back from work to teach four classes of English to get by. The majority of people lost all their savings in 2008 and 2012 and people live without savings.
He used to be a communist but now is an anarchist. He shared us a story about how he was protesting in Charleston during the George Floyd riots (he was bartending there) and when the rioters smashed into a break the communist discouraged it. He realized that then they weren’t as radical as they though. They wouldn’t support the redistribution of wealth to members oppressed by centuries of racism. Also in Athens in 2011 the anarchist had the numbers to storm the parliament building but the communists prevented them. The communists and anarchists do not get along in Athens.
It’s hard to explain, and I’m sure I won’t get it quite right. You see, when you travel, you experience the moment you’re in, which absorbs you completely. It pulls you into the present, as everything you see feels new. But travel also has a way of pulling you backward in time, and even forward into the future.
Spending time with Lisa made me realize just how warm and open-minded she is, which softened some of my once harsh, intense attitudes toward the French. She confessed — quite honestly — one of the common generalizations about French students on Erasmus: their tendency to isolate themselves with only each other. And yet, I found myself defending them, comparing it to how Americans can be far more insular and ignorant. My time in Athens didn’t make me less interested in Americans; it made me even more curious about Europeans and their ways of thinking. I felt beholden to them, learning so much from their culture, their history, and their perspective.
Somehow during my week in Athens my thoughts always returned back to my family, especially my sister. We called each other one night and I cried telling her how much I missed her. I had never felt so close to my immediate family — my sister, my dad, my mom — thinking especially of her and the way she relates to our father, Angelo. Travel itself triggers its own kind of internal journey — one of reflection. Memories return, and moments once forgotten recrystallize, emerging with a clarity they didn’t have before. It’s as if the act of moving through space creates a new lens through which the past is suddenly sharper, more vivid, and connected to the present in unexpected ways.
In the end, my time in Athens was not just a trip across the world; it was a journey through time, through family, and through the layers of identity that have shaped me. The presence of my Pappous, though no longer physical, was a constant companion — guiding me, encouraging me, and reminding me of the values he lived by. As I traced the geography of my ancestry, my travels took on a deeper meaning. It was not merely about seeing new places; it was about rediscovering a part of myself that had long been dormant, a part of me that is both Greek and American.
I discovered the works of Alekos Fassianos and the french post impressionists. The vivid, dreamlike paintings of Fassianos seemed to speak directly to the spirit of the Greek people — capturing the mythic beauty of Greece while reflecting its modern, complex soul. Each painting felt like an extension of the landscape itself, echoing the timeless dance between the past and present.
And it was C.P. Cavafy’s words from Ithaca that echoed in my mind as I walked along the shore of Aegina: “To buy fine things, mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, sensual perfume of every kind — as many sensual perfumes as you can.” The poem spoke to the idea that the journey is as important as the destination, and that the true treasures lie in the experiences themselves. In this, I found a blueprint to reflect upon my own journey. The beauty of an island which unfolded itself in layers to me: the shimmering glow casted over the tranquil waters; the warmth of the sun and people, their hospitality as beautiful and inviting as the land itself.
It was on that island, I realized that my journey mirrored the archetypal one Cavafy describes: I heard the call, I passed the tests, and I left transformed. Greece, with all its layers of history, culture, and personal connection, continues to call me back. In its landscapes, its people, and its poetry, I found not only echoes of my Pappous’s legacy but also the deepest parts of myself.
This trip became more than just a moment in time — it was a full circle, a reunion with my heritage and an awakening to the world around me. As I carry these experiences, I feel myself walking further into the future, yet always anchored by the wisdom of the past. Greece will always be there, calling me to return, as it continues to shape my path forward.

When I was moving out and selling as much as possible someone came to my apartment to buy my old mattress. On their way out they saw the two photographs I’d printed and mounted on the wall. They asked about buying them and I decided to give them the one of Saratoga beach. The brush of pastels spread across a sunset beach had given colour to an otherwise empty apartment. It was time to move on. Giving away my DIY print was a great ending for something I can no longer retain. The other print, of Yuki at a pagoda in Japan, didn’t seem appropriate to give away and so I threw it out — a symbolic guesture to move out and move on.
I’ve come to Athens on a class trip with ten other students and my studio professor. We are here as tourists but also researchers, seeking to understand the architecture and archeology of the city and islands in the Agean.
On the first day we walked around the the Archaeological Site of Kerameikos. This was the first of many walking days to other ancient ruins including the Roman forum, Hadrians library, Ancient Agora, temple of Zeus and Aristotle’s school. Many of them are ruins with little remaining but help to understand the history of the city. Since we were travelling as an architecture class, our focus was largely on the building ruins and urbanism.
One of the most interesting walks was on the first day when we visited Philopappos Hill across from the acropolis. In the 50s an architect by the name of Dimitris Pikionis oversaw the construction of roads and pathways that transformed the landscape from a visual experience to one that included the tactile roughness of old stones collected from the city. He salvaged marble slabs and reused them as paving stones to make pathways. This got me thinking that I should explore walkscapes in my future architectural research and the ways different ground conditions affect the user experience. The ground and pathways played a small part in the book I self published and my thesis. This is an area I’d like to investigate further.
The path led to a reconstructed church and pavilion. At the time of construction the pavilion had a view of the acropolis but is now blocked by trees. Our professor was of the opinion that the way the pavilion connects views, landscape, and movement all together makes it one of the most important transformative works of modern architecture. I would agree that the pavilion is quite nice and impactful but I don’t know enough of its legacy to understand it’s significance.
As one ascends past the pavilion, various glimpses of the acropolis are visible between trees and bushes. The acropolis is always present and is beautiful. The pathway changed slowly from smooth slabs to rougher flagstones eventually reaching an open plaza and at the top a monument that was once a tomb. This was our first glimpse of the city from above but not the last.
The art of photography has in it emotions of the photographer. The past three years of graduate school have been largely framed as a period of self development and growth accelerated by an abrupt transition from partnered to solitary life. I see a clear personality in the lineage of my photography that I am keen to change. Now that I’m travelling alone I feel that it is appropriate to find a new way of looking at the world. I want to be different and see that in my photography. I want this new chapter to be transformation and evolution.
A year ago, I bought an extra wide camera lens for landscape photography and sold my stock lens that was no longer giving me sharp images. This purchase was a legacy of my previous perspective to frame open landscapes and wide vistas behind a solitary figure.
As this trip approached, I reassessed my desire to obtain a zoom lens thinking that zooming in would be a suitable way to alter my perspective. I couldn’t find a good deal on a used lens and was also busy with school. A week before my departure I was again looking for a specific camera lens and reading online that eBay would be a good place to get second hand lenses. At 2AM I purchased a lens from Japan that would arrive a few days before I left. I was concerned about it arriving late because I would be moving out of my apartment the day I departed. Unfortunately I did not read the listing properly because the lens was an a-mount SAL18135 and my camera needs an e-mount SEL18135. I didn’t expect a lens would be made with different mounts so I got the wrong lens.
During our time in Athens we also visited many museums including the acropolis museum, museum of contemporary art, and archeology museum. The acropolis museum was the most interesting because it was the first thing we did in Athens and the building was very modern. It had fragments of the acropolis arranged along an interior core the same size and dimension as the pantheon. Chunks of the ruin had been placed to give a semblance of the real thing up on the hill. As an introduction to the archeology we would see in the next few days, it was an excellent appetizer. Below the museum was an excavated neighbourhood.
The museum of contemporary art was interesting because there were provocative works that spoke to geopolitical issues, pain, and suffering. We we fortunate to have a guided tour by a curator and access to the roof that is normally closed to the public. This was a unique view of the city because there aren’t many buildings taller than theirs from which to see the rest of the city. It was also relatively close to the acropolis which has protected views.
While it can be difficult to imagine a world based on foundation ruins, it helped to hear stories and read history. The acropolis was as highlight well worth the early morning visit. Arriving at opening avoided the crowds and was under a softer sun that wasn’t as draining in terms of heat. The ruins were impressive because they are clearly visible from the city but up close the scale became larger than expected. In the past it would have been possible to walk within the ruins but that has been closed off and some kind of reconstruction work was underway.
The visit to the acropolis was complemented by a reading from the professor that I reread while sitting on a piece of marble at the acropolis. The reading described the entrance sequence and the arrangement of buildings forming an asymmetrical aesthetic perspective. After reading the article I was able to walk the space and assess it for myself. It is not entirely visible today because a large statue is missing and the pedestrian pathway was altered with a horrible slab of concrete but it is otherwise accurate and interesting.
For the modern urbansim, we visited the an urban park along the port coast that was made for the 2004 Athens Olympics by destroying an industrial area and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center by architect Renzo Piano which was a fantastic example of an urban park on a slope. Unforutnately the library was closed but the upper lighthouse lookout was open and was an interesting moment to see the port as well as the park.
Athens is a wonderful city. I’ve been continuously impressed by the kindness, generosity, and politeness of the people. Twice we went to restaurants where we unknowingly ordered the wrong thing and twice we were offered food on the house to compensate. The people have been patient and kind- an unexpected delight. As well, the platting has been fantastic and the food delicious. Many of our meals came with a shot or dessert to finish off. We’ve also eatten a lot of soulvaki and gelato. It feel like we didn’t go a day without a stop for gelato.
Two other very enjoyable moments were the climbing of Lycabettus hill and Lofos Strefi. The first is one of the most prestigeous hills that make up ancient Athens and is a fantastic lookout. We had some trouble as a group collecting at the bottom because we all came from different places and some were late so it was a scramble up the hill in time for sunset. The rush was worthwhile though because the view was beautiful. The path zigzags up to a restaurant and crowded lookout. Right below on the path though was a pleasant spot to take photos and watch the night creep over the city. I struggled to capture photos with the wide angle camera lens but enjoyed catching up with a friend as the sun set and the cityscape illuminated. Unfortunately we were not able to stay as long as we would have liked because the rest of our party was waiting for us for dinner.
Some days later I was on my own and went up Lofos Strefi which I suspect is an old marble quarry. This is another nearby hill that’s not as high. The view was interesting because I could see the acropolis and to my left was Lycabettus. On an overcast evening where the rain sprinkled, I enjoyed a moment of solitude to listen to music emanating from the trees below. For the time, I enjoyed being alone on the hill above a city of millions. I would later discover it to be a musician in a restaurant hidden behind a rock cropping and under a large tree.
I’ve struggled on this trip to frame my pictures. Part of the reason is that I’m not enjoying the super wide aspect of the 10–18mm lens I have. It is so wide that it visibly distorts the images requiring a lot of post cropping and because of that it looks artificial. It is also the conditions cities are not panoramic landscapes and a tighter crop is more desirable. On the other hand, it could be that these struggles are a reflection of the internal turmoil to perceive the world differently and to be different. Photography in some ways is confirming some of my personal turmoil.
While the cameras has been troublesome, the iPhone remains a dependable with a regular field of view and suitable perspective. It’s easy to use, light, quick to access and always with me. It doesn’t come as a surprise that most people are phone wielding tourists and dslrs are fewer and fewer. Some days I wonder if I should just leave my camera at home. For the blog and Instagram the iPhone is sufficient but I’m always hoping for a special moment that would be worthy of a large print.

Athens is an unequivocal dump.
I had illusions of Athens being similar to Thessaloniki, so I booked a ticket. Flying in from Corfu on New Years eve was an admittedly strange time to arrive. The airport was clean and modern, the rail connection to the city was descent. At this point I was mildly optimistic about visiting this city. Arriving in Syntagma square and heading a little north along big boulevards and then climbing slightly into a narrow grid network of streets, I found my accommodation.
After checking in to my accommodation. I watched the fireworks from the top of a nearby hill. Something that struck me from the ground level but was far more visible from above was the layer of smog enveloping the city. Pollution levels were on a par with other dirty cities like Sofia, Hanoi and Bangkok. However this is supposed to be a first world European country. I was expecting something more like Rome or Madrid, instead it reminded me more of the grimmy streets of Sofia and I felt I could even of been back in the chaotic streets of Hanoi or Bangkok again.
Immediately after setting out to explore the center on new year’s day, I encountered a large group of drug addicts who had gathered in the morning sun next to a classical building. I saw arms peppered with scars from injecting, others had needle in hand ready to use. As I walked on I quickly forgot the scene i’d just witnessed as I made it to towards Syntagma square in square. Admittedly I had an od impression of the city on Jan 1st as everything was closed and Greek people were at home. But I noticed another homeless drug addict sleeping on a bench in a narrow alley in the center. I was shocked to see his forearm covered in open wounds, it honestly looked like his arm was rotten. I was in such disbelief as to what I had just walked past that I went back to make sure that was indeed what I witnessed. What struck me about this scene was the respectable well dressed people walking past this man or standing just twenty meters away, but being totally oblivious to his plight.
In the subsequent days I walked around more and discovered Athens has a bustling bar and restaurant scene in the center. However outside the center the streets are a mess. Pavements barely exist so people walk in the street. All the streets seem to be coated in a layer of dirt, whether from pollution or something else I don’t know. I stayed in an airbnb where you have to raise and lower a metal security gate, like they have on shops when closed. “It’s to stop the anarchists damaging the building” the host said. In a society where anarchists are so mainstream, it suggests to me a lack of direction.
All in all I had a very bad impression of Athens. How can I enjoy the chaos of the city and the food when you have drug addicts and homeless people suffering horrifically in the center. And the Greek people acting with total indifference. Add on to that the cities dirty disorganised streets and thick atmosphere of pollution, I felt an overall seedy atmosphere. This overrided any quaintness from the neverending ramshackle nature of the shops.
One positive note I will end
on is the Greek peoples hospitality was very impressive as always, it’s just a shame Athens can’t be as impressive.

[Socrates] was so well-disciplined in his way of life that on several occasions when plague broke out in Athens he was the only man who escaped infection. — Diogenes Laertius
In 430 BC, Athens was devastated by plague. We don’t know exactly what caused it but it’s been speculated that it was a form of typhus, typhoid, or possibly smallpox. What happened during the Athenian Plague seems to foreshadow aspects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our own experiences probably also help us to better understand what the ancient Athenians must have been going through. I won’t labour the obvious parallels but rather I’ll just tell the story and mention some comparisons briefly along the way…
The epidemic spread throughout the Mediterranean but Athens, the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the region, was hit hardest of all. Attica, the area encompassing Athens, had a total population of roughly a quarter of a million, including thousands of foreign residents and maybe a hundred thousand slaves. The disease was apparently brought into the Greek port of Piraeus by travellers and merchants, from whence it quickly escalated into an epidemic, tearing through the population of neighbouring Athens.
After the first outbreak began to relent, the Athenians must have breathed a collective sigh of relief. Unfortunately, though, there were two further major outbreaks of the plague in Athens, occurring in 429 and 427…

Interview by Alexander Strecker
The streets (and walls) of Athens have been covered — truly covered — in graffiti for as long as I can remember. As a child visiting from the United States, I didn’t know what to make of these indecipherable tags and scribbles. More broadly, I remember how my feelings about Athens itself were consistently ambivalent. Sometimes I reveled in the city’s chaos; other times I was certain that it was the ugliest place I had ever seen. But as I grew older, and started to travel more widely, Athens’ particularities steadily became more striking to me. Not only did I begin to feel a deep admiration for its flagrant disregard of my opinion, but more specifically, I came to realize how the city’s graffiti contained multitudes. Visiting year after year, a neighborhood walk became many things: a political education (ΕΞΩ ΤΟ ΝΑΤΟ! — NATO, Get Out!); an invaluable source for vocabulary (perhaps best not rewritten here); and finally, a reminder of how a city that always felt both old and new, crumbling yet unchanging, could be the site of ongoing struggle and reinvention. Today, I see these tags and murals as inextricable components of the city’s fabric, as much as the venerated antiquities or devilish topography.
For the multi-disciplinary artist Alexandros Simopoulos, graffiti has also been a near-constant presence in his experience of living and making work in Athens. As early as high school, graffiti served as a creative outlet for Alexandros, establishing an underlying layer that he would later return to and cover over, again and again, in different ways. He continued to produce work while a student in university — where he focused on humanitarian law and international relations, both of which would also express themselves in his artistic work — but still, he could not get graffiti out of his mind. After university, he was once more drawn to the art form, producing graffiti-inspired t-shirts, skateboards, and prints. His timing was propitious: street art was having what Alexandros calls, “its second renaissance in Athens” amidst the growing financial crisis. He quickly realized that his adolescent hobby could become so much more.
Alexandros explains, “The story of graffiti and street art is complex and contradictory. Even the very terms of ‘graffiti’ and ‘street art’ have highly contested histories, which continue to generate intense debate inside and outside the community. In Athens, though, this story had a local twist during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, there were endless reports from major international media outlets about street art in the Greek capital [for example: How Angry Street Art is Making Athens Hip]. The angle was that there must be some key relationship between the country’s economic situation and the city’s street art. The easy narrative: graffiti as resistance, with its images providing an accessible aestheticization of the country’s problems, such as urban poverty, alongside a manifestation of its ‘brave spirit.’ But very few of these articles undertook any in-depth research; rather, I think graffiti provided a free and edgy illustration for their pieces. The crisis put Greece in the spotlight and street art became a handy example.” He then reveals, with a knowing smile, “I am pretty sure that some artists made political work on certain streets because they knew it would be spotted by journalists and later published in, for example, The International New York Times. Easy narratives can be manipulated by both sides…”

In Athens, though, this story had a local twist during the height of the financial crisis. The easy narrative: graffiti as resistance, with its images providing an accessible aestheticization of the country’s problems. He then reflects, “But what’s important to remember is that there was plenty of street art and political graffiti in Athens before the crisis.”
Yet as the old adage goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity. As Alexandros explains, “Over the past decade, street art has also created tourism for Athens. Many people travel here to paint — or, at least, they used to — we call them ‘graffiti tourists’. In Greece, it’s easy to work outside, especially since making graffiti is not heavily criminalized and the weather is good. The popularity of street art has certainly contributed to the touristification of the Athenian center, for better and for worse. For my generation, it has certainly been for worse: the recent inundation of visitors, and Airbnbs, has outpriced us all when it comes to housing.” He then reflects, “But what’s important to remember is that there was plenty of street art and political graffiti in Athens before the crisis. Additionally, street art has been used for gentrification for quite some time, all over the world, Berlin being a celebrated example (though we see it in London, New York, Barcelona and other places as well). Artists move where there is space and where it is cheap. All of these phenomena are not confined to a few trendy neighborhoods in post-2010 Athens.”
Alexandros understands these complications better than most: he has engaged with the street art community on many levels, at home and, lately, abroad. In Athens, he not only produced his own work, but collaborated with Cacao Rocks, another prominent practitioner [as well as an inaugural SNFA Artworks Fellow], to run a gallery in the city center dedicated to street artists. As he tells me, “Several years ago, Cacao and I shared a studio in the building’s basement. The gallery was on the ground floor. There, we had more or less free rein to do what we wanted. For over three years, we invited people we knew and gave them a welcoming space to experiment with formats. We even flew in artists from abroad to do mini-residencies and exhibit their work, bringing international points of view to Greece. In addition, the gallery worked as a small arts school for the kids of the neighborhood. It was an amazing experience — at its peak, it was a vibrant hub for varied people to meet, collaborate, experiment, and the spark for many new projects. The gallery was at the core of a small street art scene that was growing bigger and bigger. I remember that Cacao and I once had a completely sold-out show — but no matter how many gallery exhibitions we held and no matter how much work we sold, we lived in a parallel world: we were definitely not part of the contemporary art scene in Athens, nor was it something which we were interested in joining at that time.”
As Alexandros looks back on this heady time, I can hear the mixture of pride and frustration that accompanies the position of the perpetual outsider. Being on the edge — whether as a street artist excluded from contemporary art or as an artist living in Athens, a place that remains on the “periphery” of the global art world — affords a great deal of freedom. But it can also be isolating. Regardless, Alexandros reminds me that periphery is always a relative concept. He refers to the example of the 2017 edition of Documenta to underscore how the art world is never monolithic: at every level, there are insiders and outsiders, irreconcilable narratives, and overlapping spectrums of power. He says, “Documenta portrayed Athens as a locality of chaos and crisis and, at the same time, rebirth and self-determination. It was a narrative drawn from many sources, which made it appealing for different people, especially artists. Still, the event ultimately came from the outside, and thus its narrative exoticized Athens. It didn’t, perhaps couldn’t, explore all the complexities contained here.”
Being on the edge — whether as a street artist excluded from contemporary art or as an artist living in Athens, a place that remains on the “periphery” of the global art world — affords a great deal of freedom. But it can also be isolating.
Over the past few years, Alexandros’ own path reveals his efforts to bridge these many competing approaches and gaps — between street and art, politics and space, Greece and abroad. As he tells me, “What’s so special about street art, more than anything, is its directness. It can reach people in their everyday lives. I’m interested in working across worlds, not just speaking to curators and critics. I want to create work that communicates with everyone.” In pursuit of a more legible visual language, Alexandros first left Athens to study illustration and visual arts in London. He then returned, now with a wider focus on making work that deals with the idea of public space — not illegally but as an invited guest. He tells me, “I’m not painting outside much anymore. I don’t even consider myself a street artist at this point. Instead, I am contending with the difference between what I thought I was doing and its perception from the outside. Conceptually, I am thinking about questions such as ‘What happens in your body when you paint graffiti? What happens in your mind? What kind of narratives do you come across, what kind of people, how are they communicated — and how has all of this transformed cities around the world? Concretely, my expanded point of view means I now work with a greater range of people, all of whom have widely disparate perceptions of street art and public space more broadly. Through these interactions, I am exploring my relationship to public spaces from other people’s perspective. I try to actively engage them in the creative process or even make them part of the work.”
As a former student of humanitarian law and international relations, Alexandros’ broadening point of view continues to ripple outward, well outside of Greece. For example, this past summer, he spent three months in Berlin and, prior to that, six months in New Mexico as a Fulbright Fellow. He also received public commissions to paint murals in locations ranging from Hungary to Portugal, and even Greenland. He reflects on the privilege, and challenges, of extending his work in this way. “Traveling creates a global community and network of artists who can exchange skills and ideas. This has always existed in the street art scene — while a piece might not travel, the people who make these public spaces are able to move and bring their knowledge with them to new settings. This does present some complications, though. When I travel to make work, I am confronting a place I’m not from, where I might be unaware of specific tensions or histories. The only way to overcome this deficit is to spend as much time there as possible before making any work and to meet and interact as sincerely as possible with people from different communities. Wherever I go, I try to respond to those around me and make the art meaningful for everyone involved. This has become the most challenging and rewarding part of the process for me.”

What kind of narratives do you come across, what kind of people, how are they communicated — and how has all of this transformed cities around the world?”
Alexandros’ new perspective has not only helped him with his work overseas, but to look at Greece with fresh eyes. This was evident in Still Here Tomorrow, the Artworks group exhibition held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation last summer. In the show, Alexandros’ piece effectively juxtaposed views from inside and outside, embodying his desire to understand other points of view while retaining his local roots. The installation, titled Best served old (Anti-austerity artists are impressing the tourists), mixed street art motifs such as pigeons and stray dogs with aesthetics taken from ancient Greek art — red and black-figure vase painting and portrait statuary — as well as the pan-Balkan blue evil eye. According to his artist statement, the entire installation was meant to evoke the pandering displays in tacky souvenir shops. But beneath the dark humor, Alexandros had a positive message. “Many of the images on these ceramics relate to stories of tradition. Tradition in Greece (and elsewhere) has been the basis for countless horrible, nationalistic, and extremely conservative narratives. But, in some instances, it can also point us towards more radical ideas. For example, tradition can help foster a connection to the land, by which I mean the actual soil — something that has become revolutionary again today since it runs counter to so many globalized forces.”
Still, as we discuss how to synthesize such opposing views, it seems fitting that we end our conversation on the subject of land. After all, street artists are ever-rooted to their physical surroundings. And so we conclude by returning to the city of Athens one final time, with Alexandros saying, “In so many places in the West, public space is tightly regulated: you go to your work and after you go to designated places to enjoy yourself in very predetermined ways (bar, restaurant, theater). In between, public space is used only as a passage, with few actions produced there. But in the words Martyn Reed, I like to think of streets as ‘repositories of meaning for those who occupy and move through them, as places of contested perceptions and negotiated understanding.’ We can see this in Athens, where public space is chaotic and put under many competing demands. People, bikes, cars, and café tables fight over finite space. It’s not always pleasant, but I love the plethora of communication that happens in these increasingly squeezed plots of land. It excites me to see Athenians using every bit of public space available to them; you find people everywhere. The city’s residents continue to spend a large amount of time outside, together. Here, there is an intensity of community that I don’t find in other cities in Europe or the United States. For me, that’s the essential quality of Athens, that’s a big part of what makes it special.”

Clearly Athens has been going through it as of late. The 2009 financial crisis and the subsequent underthought austerity measures put in place by the IMF crippled the country’s economy, and hit its capital hard. Due to this, things got cheaper for foreigners, and huge amount of tourists and investors were flooding the place before the COVID pandemic; apparently this improved things a bit, but tourism definitely brings its own headaches. And, as I write this, some of its suburbs just stopped burning.
So yes, Athens is pretty screwed up right now. However, things are bad in the sense that they were in New York in the late 70s, or in East Berlin after the wall came down: this economic suffering has coincided with Athens becoming a rare, rare beast. Rent is cheap, and so is the food (which is, clearly, Greek, a great cuisine); additionally, it’s safe. All this adds up to major appeal for a certain group: artists.
On the streets, the graffiti scene is very, very strong: by many accounts, Athens is an urban gallery (there’s a documentary about the scene, albeit from 2014, here). It’s also an amazing place for skateboarding, with a grip of skate spots and its hilly terrain, which has provided the skate community with a lot of videos and travel writeups about the place. On the other side of the coin, there…

Monastiraki square — another very central area of Athens.
Athens is an absolutely marvelous place, no doubt about it. We thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit and definitely plan on going back at some point in the future. Nonetheless, it is not a perfect place. No place in the world is. I have alluded to the three sides on our postcard post, but l will delve into it a little more. As tourists, we often gloss over the great parts of a place and rarely see the true local side of said place. It’s understandable, after all, you’re on vacation and world problems should not be on your mind. Regular readers know l try to present what l see in all its glory, and crappiness, This will be no exception. I present to you our observations of the amazing city.
Syntagma square is one of Athens top tourist attractions, where it all happens…both good and bad!
Athens is the capital of Greece with a population of just over 11 million people, so yes…very crowded. The heart of the city is Syntagma (Constitution) Square. It is definitely the most famous part of Athens. It is a lively part of town. The Parliament building is located here. Once upon a time, it used to be the King’s Palace. Built between 1836 and 1840 by King Otto, who had daddy (Ludwig I of Bavaria) pay for it. Fun fact: The original plan had been to build the King’s palace on the Acropolis! Thank god it never came to pass. Can you imagine tearing down that history to put up a dime a dozen palace? Syntagma Square is where all the protests and parties (New Year’s Eve etc) happens. Among the government buildings, there are tons of shops and cafes.
Athens sightseeing: Parliament House Syntagma square Athens — the changing of the guards should be on your Athens itinerary.
Here’s a video l did on the changing of the guard, a fun thing to see in Athens. Sorry for the shaky hand in the beginning, but l rarely do this :-). I love how they imitate the movement of horses.
What to do in Athens : Try both Traditional and otherwise food and expand your palette.
It is hard not to eat well. The food is hearty and delicious. We had lots of really good traditional food. We had an amazing foodie tour and we sampled lots of coffee drinks that we enjoyed thoroughly.
Some of the yummy goodies we hate. I have had my fill of Greek salads for a while though :-)
I have never been a huge fan of drinking to excess or pub crawling, but l do enjoy a good glass of wine or cocktail. The area of Athens we stayed at, called Psyrri, is a bohemian and artsy neighborhood. About a 20–30 minute walk from Syntagma square. Iroon square, which is the very heart of the neighborhood, has tons of eateries with live music, and lots of bars. I mean bars with proper tables and chairs with dark interiors and great music. I confess l don’t know what they become after 11 or so because l am in bed :-), but during the day, they are wonderful to hang out in. Some had Greek music, some jazz, my favorite were the ones with bossa nova music. We actually went pub crawling, going from one to the next, having coffee drinks (mostly Federico) and cocktails (mostly me). Absolutely loved it.
Simple, good food. Stewed meat and white rice. We found a little place run by a girl and the grandmother with an all Greek menu and l just explained that l wanted something simple and she gave me this. I was licking the bowl :-)
Non touristy things to do in Athens :-) . So many cool cafes and bars to sit, people watch and listen to good music. I had so many good margaritas too!
If you ever have a chance to eat the orange pie on the right, go for it. It is amazing. The one on the left was like pudding. I didn’t like it, but ate it because the woman insisted on comping us, and l couldn’t be rude! :-)
Visit Athens and try the yummy kinds of food everywhere!
Pork belly, grilled..served with homemade chips. Food sampling is definitely one of the best things to do in Athens. The flavors and spices are awesome.
We found cute little off the wall places to eat, everything from kebabs to gyros. I can’t remember eating anything bad. The fact that the prices were reasonable was an added bonus.
This super friendly guy insisted on Federico taking his picture when he saw the camera and started talking to us.
The people were very friendly, warm and smiled a lot. Everyone was eager to help when we got lost, sometimes even walking us to the metro station. It was pleasant haggling with the traders, they weren’t aggressive like in Marakesh, which was a nightmare for Federico, but fun for me..felt just like home!
Remains of the Roman Agora Athens, built during the Roman period in Plaka Athens
Greek mythology is alive and well. Being able to see where it all began is a joy. If you can afford it, I think everyone should visit Athens at least once in their lifetime. Sightseeing in Athens is mind blowing. Places such as the:
Acropolis Athens night view. Amazing sight! The Acropolis is probably one of the top things to do in Greece, if not the top.
You don’t see sights like this ancient columns everyday! Well, unless you’re in Athens Greece of course :-) Part of the Roman Agora in Plaka Athens
Some of the best things to see in Athens include: (Things to do in Athens Greece)
Athens tourist attractions: If you’re looking for Athens tours, we recommend GetYourGuide tours, which we have personally used on our trips.
Places to visit in Athens Greece include the Tower of the Winds in Athens Greece. It has stood at the bottom of the Acropolis for over 2,000 years. It was used by merchants to forecast the weather.
It seems like there is a temple dedicated to every Greek god! :-) . This time around, we didn’t really seek them out much as l’d already visited them on my first trip to Athens.
Things to see in Athens: Great street art that one can appreciate.
Street art depiction of the stray Riot dog Loukanikos who always sided with the protesters against the police. He was actually one of Time magazine’s people of the year 2011. He died in 2014 :-(
This is good stuff :-) . What to do in Greece? definitely look for street art. There are some great ones.
When they’re good, they’re very good. We found some great street art in Athens in the neighborhood of Psyrri, right off the main square. There are some very talented artists.
Athens weather is pretty good year round. There are few days of rain and the average temperature is 84 degrees which is quite nice. August is the hottest month to visit Athens. In the winter, the temperature drops to about 59–62 degrees which is still hot for some. Weather in Greece in October is about 74 degrees and October, along with April seems to be the best times to visit Athens.
The two often go hand in hand l know. It’s hard not to notice the increased number of drug addicts that are in Athens. Eating outside on the sidewalk is a thing in Europe. Neither one of us like this. The sidewalks are often dirty and l hate people passing by peering at my food, dogs sniffing and doing their business or peeing in front of me, and boy..the sidewalks are dirty and stink! (worse in Spain). Probably the biggest reason is my fear of cats! They are freaking everywhere. I will overturn the table if one gets close! :-) Anyway, we prefer to eat inside. Sometimes, depending on how the exterior seating is, we will seat outside and have drinks. This really gave me a chance to observe just how rampant the drug use is. We saw at least 5 separate instances where drug abusers were tweaking and it brought back nasty memories of my pharmacy years. Tweaking is when meth users (tweakers) become unpredictable, paranoid, and might be dangerous, usually at the end of a drug binge. One woman was screaming because she felt something/someone was hurting her, was scratching herself furiously and taking off her clothes as she walked, all her teeth were rotten. A man was trying to calm her down, but he looked almost in the same sad shape. Another time, a man in a red shirt was in a fit, just rolling on the floor and yelling angrily, and went about punching the tree shrubs, he was quite close to the diners. I was a bit scared honestly. I notice though, that the employees come out in full force, to gawk, and also probably to make sure that their clients are not disturbed, which is kind of re-assuring. We didn’t take any pictures because l really don’t care to showcase human despair.
This is just off the main square. You can see the beginning of the sleeping bags, further down, it’s narrower and we walked on the street instead.
I also noticed that quite a few of the cafes feed the homeless. I actually mentioned it to Federico after l saw it a couple of times and we made sure to eat again at the places we noticed did that. The homeless people would stand at a particular spot and wait. When the waitress/waiter had a spare minute, she would bring out food for them, they would take it, and go away..well, all except for this one guy, she gave him a sandwich and he defiantly refused to leave. He just stood there eating. Now, this guy looked like a hobo, matted hair, torn clothes and l’m sure smelled badly. We weren’t very close to him, but l could tell it was disturbing to the nearest diners. She called another waitress who came out and talked to the guy firmly in an angry and raised voice which made him finally leave. It’s so sad to see, and while l feel sorry for them, I just would rather not be exposed to that. If that makes me an cold unfeeling twat, then so be it. I think it’s just a part of everyday life and people just get used to it, but it’s jarring for visitors to Athens.
Lots of fun stores can be found at the flea market. Consider it a must visit in Athens.
I had previously mentioned the high amount of homeless people that were sleeping in the doorways of houses in the area where we stayed. There were also lots of homeless sleeping in the nearby parks. I can only imagine how much worse the refugees have it as this was mostly a locals area. We saw people sleeping during the day in the porticoes just off the beautiful Monastiraki square. I assume the situation is only going to get worse.
This is just bad crappy doodling!
Unfortunately, there’s more crap than good stuff. This was an old historic theater that the government doesn’t have money to fix, refuse to sell it and is left to rot.
When they’re bad, they are simply horrible! Does this look good to anyone except to someone in a drug induced haze? They cover the houses, stores and streets with it. The same can be said for a great part of Spain, and l think it’s terrible too. I’m not sure when defamation became art :-)!
What happens to most of the refugees fleeing war torn countries that end up in Athens? A bleak life with no end in sight. Syntagma square for all its beauty, also has a dark side. A side where these young men turn to prostitution to survive. It’s so disheartening to read these stories. Here is a video that does a better job than me of showing you how things are that l watched recently. These boys are trapped in a world where the only way to survive is to become male hustlers. We were told by both our host and our food guide to stay away from Omonia Square (this article made me aware of that before we arrived) especially at night because it’s ground zero. We took the advice.
A quick Google search will bring you tons of stories on how hard life is for these young boy. It’s a growing problem. When a 16 year old says he wished he could die that very night because he has no future and his advice to future refugees? Don’t come. It’s better to stay and live with the war. They keep getting younger too. We hear about the girls, but the boys are caught up in the same vicious cycle.
Of course you should! The beauty and the history alone should make you want to visit, not to mention the people. Once again, no place is perfect. It’s no different than any city in America with the drug abuse and prostitution. Would you not visit New York because of Times Square? Thankfully, unlike the U.S, the people in Athens don’t carry guns. Tourism, apart from shipping, is the biggest money maker for the country. After a devastating economic downturn, the country is slowly recovering and they need that money. There are so many cities and islands to visit in this diverse country, you’re bound to find someplace you’ll love, like Heraklion , Crete where we spent some time and had a fantastic time. We spent a total of 15 days in Greece on our holiday and are eager for more. Is Athens worth visiting? The answer is a resounding yes! There are so many things to do in Athens.
Where to stay in Athens Greece — We stayed in Pysrri and we really liked it. It is funky, bohemian and artsy. We stayed at this AirBnB studio flat which was very central and had a stunning view of the Acropolis. My only complaint would be the bathroom which is tiny, but apart from that, it was spotlessly clean, had everything you needed. The WiFi was super fast and the A/C was insanely efficient. Feel free to use our referral code to get some $ off your first stay if you’re new to the platform. I don’t know if it’s the best place to stay in Athens, but we really liked it and would stay there again.
Have you been to Athens? or any other part of Greece? What were your observations? Did you see the good, the bad or the ugly side of Athens?

Even the second time that I went to Athens I was totally fascinated!
I am one of those strange people who didn’t only have Latin at school but Ancient Greek as well. It wasn’t because I really wanted to learn that language. Nope, I just completely refused to learn French when I had to decide between those two languages. So I started learning Ancient Green when I was 14.
I think it was in 2004 when we did a two-weeks-trip to Greece with all my class mates that had chosen as well to study Ancient Greek. By bus we went through Austria and Italy to Ancona and took a ship that would bring us over night to Patras. It was so exciting!
The trip obviously included a stop in Athens! We couldn’t leave out the capital of the new and the ancient Greece.
When I was standing at the Acropolis for the second time — 29, two university degrees and living the digital nomad lifestyle- I couldn’t help but seeing my 17 year old me — super blond and a real rebel. I remember well how we were standing in sun, sweating and listing to the tour guide. I could almost see myself standing infront of the Erechtheion — with hurting feet from all the walking, unpatient but curious at the same time.
It was a strange feeling to stand in front of the Parthenon again and to think about what happened since last time 12 years back in time. My last years at school, the 7 years studying at university and my life as a digital nomad, a life of travels and with my work as a travel blogger.
The weekend in Athens after my week on Coboat turned out to make me travel through time twice!
Because at the same time I was trying to remember all the details of what I learned during my studies of Archeology at school and at university where I studied it as a minor subject.
So I was standing at the Acropolis with my dear nomad friends Anca and Adrian and they wanted to know more about the history of this place. It turned out that the signs weren’t really helpful since they wouldn’t explain the technical terms. That’s why I started explaining:
Although the settlements started in the New Stone Age (around 7500 BC), Athens had the time of prosperity just during the Classical Antiquity in the 5th and 4th Century BC. When Socrates and Platon were strolling over the Acropolis, the ago of the philosophers, artists and thinkers.
“Acropolis” means nothing else than “high city” and during the ancient times every city needed to have one. The Acropolis of Athens though became kind of the symbol of all acropolises. That’s why people always think of the Acropolis of Athens if you just talk about the acropolis. It’s World Heritage of the UNESCO.
In the center of attention of the Acropolis of Athens is the most important temple — the Parthenon, the sanctuary of the patron saint and goddess Pallas Athena Parthenos. It got destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC and they Greeks needed to rebuild it. Since then it had a 12 meters statue of Athena, made of gold and ivory. Unfortunately she got destroyed in the 6th Century.
I remember very well how Mister Herr Krauskopf — my Ancient Greek teacher at school — repeated as often as possible:
“Whenever something could lost or destroyed, we still have our dear old friend Pausanias, who is describing in his travel books all the art works and places that he saw — in an extremely detailed manner which is almost bringing them back to life.”
That’s why we know even today how the statue of Pallas Athene in the inside of the Parthenon looked like:
„The statue is created with ivory and gold. On the middle of her helmet is likeness of the Sphinx … and on either side of the helmet are griffins in relief. … The statue of Athena is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory. She holds a statue of Victory that is approx. Four cubits high, and in the other hand a spear; at her feet lies a shield and near the spear is a serpent. This serpent would be Erichthonius. On the pedestal is the birth of Pandora in relief.“
Pausanias
When I am at those kind of places with a lot of history, I can’t help myself but touching the things, closing my eyes and imagining what this column, this wall or this building has seen and lived. I imagine what story from ancient times it would whisper if it could.
I did that in Palenque for example. Between the many trees and the half covered Maya ruins I really needed to do that. Do you know that feeling?
I remembered the entrance to be on the other side. In my memory we have seen the Theatre of Dyonisos in the end and not in the beginning.
I tried to remember what I had learned: The Theatre of Dionysos was the birthplace of theatre in general. This is where the greek tragedies of Sophocles, Aeschylos and Euripides had there premieres. I was telling Anca and Adrian about Dionysos, the god of plays and wine, and about the theatre’s function of the catharsis, a purification.
I translated them es well words like Stoa into understandable English. I couldn’t believe that signs said those terms without explaining the meaning. So everybody knows what a Stoa is? People are supposed to know that it was nothing than a big hall or a walkway surrounded by columns in the very beginning. I explained Anca and Adrian that later the school of Stoicism was founded in the Stoa in Athens wich is why their name derives from the word Stoa. The reason is because they met here talking about their philosophical ideas.That’s why later a Stoa wasn’t only considered a walkway with columns but a school like place to learn and study philosophy.
I simply enjoyed the rest of the Acropolis with the temples, columns and steles and just tried to let this experience sink. That’s why I want to invite you to do the same with showing you the photos.
In the end, just some minutes before it was time to go back to the modern city and to the here and now, I took the time to admire the beautiful view and landscape.
That’s how my trip through the time in Europe’s oldest capital ended and how I got back to the year 2016. In a certain way it was a catharsis in the sense of a purification while seeing a greek tragedy Although I traveled through the time only in my head. Nevertheless I grew a bit in those few hours!
Did you ever travel through time while being on the road? I am looking forward to your answers!

The Story of the World’s Greatest Civilization
My fascination with Greek culture started in middle school. I don’t remember much from that time of my life, but I do remember the weeks we spent learning about Greek mythology. The Titans. The Gods. The Olympians. The Greeks.
That led me to Rick Riordan and one of the best book series’ I’ve ever read: Percy Jackson. Those books, and the topic of the Greek gods, were what interested me in reading, and writing for that matter. I have a draft sitting in my room of a 50,000-word Greek mythology novel. It’s not good, but I’m getting closer to scratching that itch. For whatever reason, I am drawn to the Greeks and the mythology that was created.
From there it was books from the likes of Madeline Miller and the stories of Odysseus and Achilles. Late last year I read a book from Christopher McDougall (famous for writing Born to Run) called Natural Born Heroes. The book jumped all over the place, but its central plot was about the Greek Island Crete during World War II. The stores, and the characters in them, read like a Greek tragedy. It read like a story in the Iliad or the Odyssey.
This book re-sparked my interest in the Greeks. My interest shifted away from the mythology of the Greeks to the culture of the Greeks. How is it, more than 2,000 years later, we still read and learn from that ancient civilization? I became more interested in what our modern day societies have taken from the Greeks. Reading The Perfect Mile made me reflect on the Olympic Games and how that was made famous because of the Greeks.
I started to dig deeper and found this book my Anthony Everitt. He specializes in these ancient cultures, having already read a few of his Rome books. This book, The Rise of Athens, at more than 400 pages was daunting, but I was surprised at how willing I was to come back to the book each time I put it down.
For the book you are going to have to enjoy Greek culture. But more than that, you are going to have to be interested in the beginning foundations of Greece. The mythology that surrounds its founding is blended in reality and even the great historians like Plutarch don’t differentiate the two.
The book focused on the politics and wars. It chronicled the rise of democracy and the Persian and Peloponnese wars. It brought the Hellenic world to life.
It was a difficult book to read. Almost all of it went over my head. Most of my enjoyment came from knowing even one or two of the characters (outside of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle).
The book focused on the creation of democracy, Greek warfare, life in the Mediterranean in the fourth-century. It examined the architecture and cultural center of Athens and its vast difference from Sparta.
Though the book was a bit more advanced for me, or at least of my understanding of the Greek world during this time, the ideas and information I did understand was valuable. The book was called the Rise of Athens, the Story of the Worlds Greatest Civilization. The objective of Everitt was to answer the question of how Athens became that Great civilization. Unless I missed a whole lot, after reading, Athens really didn’t seem all that great. The democracy lasted less then 200 years and were conquered by Alexander the Great shortly after.
The power of this book is that I have the ability to read the words of these ancient leaders. These are the same words that leaders from the time of Alexander the Great through the founding fathers of America have read. It’s little wonder America looks so similar to Greece and Rome. It’s because those men who created this government were so enamored with those cultures. They breathed new life into them in the creation of America. Understanding our founding, but also the founding of a lot of the knowledge we have built upon today, was worth the effort of this book.

Latest developments
On December 7, 2023, Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan made his first visit to Athens since 2017. He and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis focused the landmark visit on promoting a positive vision for the future of the bilateral relationship. Both parties signed the “Athens Declaration on Friendly Relations and Good-Neighborliness,” a non-binding document listing a cooperation agenda that ranges from encouraging mutual economic activity to minimizing military tension. This meeting stands in stark contrast to President Erdogan’s last visit to Greece in 2017, when he openly called for revising the Lausanne Treaty.
There is no issue between us that is unsolvable. So long as we focus on the big picture and don’t end up being like those who cross the sea and drown in the river.
President Erdogan after meeting with Greek PM Mitsotakis in Athens.
Context
The six years since the last meeting between a Greek Prime Minister and President Erdogan have seen Ankara escalate tensions to historic levels, particularly in the Aegean Sea, where Turkey openly questions Greek sovereignty, and Turkish fighter jets engaged in an unprecedented number of violations of Greek airspace and overflights — many times armed — over inhabited Greek islands. In a ten month span in 2022, Turkey committed 8,880 Greek airspace violations. This is the culmination of a decades long policy whereby Turkey has tried to depict the Aegean as a disputed area. In doing so it has questioned the sovereignty of Greece’s islands in the Aegean, while maintaining a casus belli — threat of war — should Greece exercise its rights under international law and extend its maritime boundaries to 12 nautical miles as spelled out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Other issues such as the status of religious minorities in both countries and Turkey’s disagreement with Greece over current international conflicts are also sources of tension, but the Aegean Sea remains at the heart of tensions between the two countries.
Expert analysis
At this meeting, the existence of [the maritime space] difficulty was acknowledged, and the leaders said we have agreed to disagree for now, and it is civilized and good for us to be able to stomach our disagreements without being acrimonious. And that’s a step — for Greece and Turkey, that’s a step forward.
John Psaropoulos, independent journalist and Al Jazeera Southeastern Europe correspondent
The Greek Current, “Mitsotakis and Erdogan commit to ‘calm waters’ in the Aegean,” Dec 8, 2023
The big picture
Whether Erdogan’s apparent change of heart is a good faith attempt at rapprochement remains to be seen. In the last decade alone he has gone from close US ally to having Congressmen suggest Turkey should be expelled from NATO. His swift and polar policy shifts on Russia, Israel, and Armenia suggest that he prioritizes short-term gains when it comes to foreign relations. However, to appear in Athens and agree not to discuss the tense issues, opting instead to focus on improving the relationship, is an overall positive. While Turkey has everything to gain from cooperation with neighbors and NATO allies, Greece and the international community should approach his olive branch with careful acceptance, implementing an approach reminiscent of that President Ronald Reagan took with the USSR: “Trust, but verify.”

Here’s what you need to know if you’re thinking about taking on a real bucket-list marathon race and running the original, Athens Authentic Marathon!
A year later than initially planned, I got to run the 38th Athens Authentic Marathon. It’s known as the ‘Authentic Marathon’ as it follows the fabled route of Greek messenger Philippides, who ran to the town of Marathon and back to Athens to bring news of a Greek battle victory against Persia, dying after he’d relayed the news.
Gladly, I only ran this route one-way and I’m still alive to tell the tale, so if you’re thinking about running the Athens Authentic Marathon in the future, here’s what you can expect.
You’ll discover to expect at the expo, how the race unfolds on the day and an overview my own race strategy that brought me a new personal best and my first ever time qualifier result.
But first, let’s get started by looking at the pre-race organisation.
The first thing you’ll notice when you start to check-out the information online about the Athens Authentic Marathon is that the quality is rather poor.
The Athens Authentic Marathon website is dated and doesn’t work well on mobile. The content is also usually out of date, with information about previous runnings easily available but little to nothing about the upcoming event. It also doesn’t help that there are several other events that share the same website, so you’ll frequently find information about the half marathon, 10k and 5k races taking place around the same time as the marathon.
It’s rather frustrating.
The social media accounts aren’t much better. They’re basically dormant until a few weeks before the race, then burst into action covering all the ribbon-cutting, permit-acquiring activities runners really couldn’t care less about. Like the website, the socials were also extremely poor.
But, on the day of the Athens Authentic Marathon itself, the organisation was perfect.
I took one of the coaches to Marathon departing from Syntagma and had zero problems. There must’ve been 20–30 coaches lined up, and when the front coach was full (or full-ish) it pulled away.
After arriving at the starting point in Marathon, it was a short walk to the stadium and a 90-minute wait until the race got underway. So as on-the-day organisation goes, there was zero anxiety. It’s just a shame that level of organisation and reassurance wasn’t present on the website and socials in the build up to the race.
This was the first Athens Authentic Marathon since COVID-19 struck so unsurprisingly there were changes from previous runnings and additional protocols in place.
At the time of running, Greece was experiencing a surge in COVID-19 case numbers so everywhere you went shops and restaurants were very hot on mask-wearing and COVID-19 certificates to prove you’re either fully vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 or have a recent negative COVID-19 test (even to the extent of having to show a vaccine certificate and wear a mask to enter a cheap souvenir store!). At the marathon expo, you had to show your vaccine status (or other acceptable status) to enter, and you had to wear a mask while you were inside.
Masks had to be worn on the coach from Athens to Marathon on the day of the race, and the coaches left sufficient room for social distancing by departing when they were probably around 60% full.
Marathon Stadium is all open air, so there was no need to wear masks while you were there, and this year there was a staggered start over two ‘races’ and eight waves, which gave space between blocks of runners. That said, the start wave had zero social distancing and even with the best attempts of the marshals, not everyone maintained a safe distance while waiting for the starting pistol…
And speaking of waves, each wave set off about three minutes after the previous one, so as I was in Wave 3, I was over the start line by about 09:06.
I was running with a friend who was much faster than me and he was placed in Wave 1. There was a lot of very strict communication about not being able to change waves, but we managed to get it sorted at the expo so he could start with me in Wave 3. Apparently, your timing chip was calibrated to activate according to your wave start time, so, if you started in a different wave, your time wouldn’t be recorded.
Overall, the COVID-19 arrangements felt safe and proportionate and in line with what everyone else was doing in Greece at the time.
The Athens Marathon expo — known as the Ergo Marathon Expo — is located at the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre (previously known at the Taekwondo Centre). It’s south of the city on the coast and makes for a nice day out to watch the sailing after you’ve collected your bib.
As the expo was a straight line walk from our apartment, we decided to take an easy stroll to the exhibition centre, which was about 4km away and all downhill. It was a lovely walk and excellent weather, but when we saw the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre we literally ran out of road — several busy motorways and lots of excavation sat between us and the expo hall with no obvious way of crossing them.
We ran into a group of Greek guys who were also on their way there, but even they didn’t know which way to go! After about a kilometre detour, we eventually ended up on the correct side of the motorways and got into the expo after showing our vaccine certificates.
Picking up our race packs was quick and easy, you just had to show your confirmation email and photographic ID. We also managed to sort running in the same wave together, which was also very easy. My friend had the back of his bib signed and stamped to show he’d been approved to run in a different wave, while his registration was updated as well so that his timing chip would work in Wave 3.
The expo offerings were pretty good, with two floors of stalls and very well attended, even if the official marathon stall was pretty small (about 30sq m) and running low on stocks of small and medium merchandise.
We spent around 45 minutes at the expo, which was enough, then grabbed some lunch before heading back into the City Centre.
On race day, it was a fairly early start as the coaches to Marathon began leaving from various points throughout Athens at 05:30, with the last coach scheduled to depart around 06:15. There were dozens of coaches lined up near Syntagma where we boarded our coach, so it was very quick and easy to get on the transport.
And even though it was before sunrise on a Sunday, the Greek parliament guards were still doing their routines, and with only a handful of runners around it was an excellent opportunity to take photos or a short video!
On the coach, there was an information tape playing, explaining in Greek and English what to expect, as well as giving a little history behind the race. So by the time you reached Marathon about 45 minute later, you’re fully briefed and raring to go.
Marathon Stadium is the ‘start village’ for the race and is virtually all outdoors. There is a small indoor area at the back, but unless you were queuing for toilets you were ‘strongly advised’ to go outside (COVID, and everything…).
The stadium itself is a bit run down but there was plenty of room, and if you arrived early enough, you could get a cheeky Strava Segment in round the running track.
There were dozens of toilets and portaloos everywhere round the stadium, so you never had to queue long for the toilet (although some did… while others decided to go al fresco…). Free water and bananas were available so you could keep fluid and carb levels topped up.
The Olympic Flame is also at Marathon Stadium, and if you time it right you can go and hold the torch. Unfortunately, we were in our start pen by then so could only look on in envy.
Running the Athens Marathon requires planning for three very different sections, which I’ll refer to as the First Half, the Hill and the End Bit. While it frustrated me a lot planning my race strategy, as conventional wisdom is to run even or negative splits that just aren’t feasible on this course, it made for a very exciting race in the end.
And don’t read the map left-to-right like a lot of people mistakenly do — the route starts in the east and heads south then west into Athens, not the other way round!
The Athens Authentic Marathon has one of the highest elevation gains of any major international marathon, with a total of 332m (1,089ft) elevation gain across its 26.2 miles. Most of that elevation gain comes in a brutal 8-mile section that begins about halfway through the race and continues relentlessly until you pass kilometre marker 31 (about 19.5 miles in).
But the good news is that the rest of the race — the End Bit — is virtually all downhill, including one of the most charitable last 800m I’ve ever experienced at a race.
After the 5km mark there are water stations every 2.5km in line with international race standards, as well as frequent toilet stops and aid stations. So from a provisions perspective, it was extremely well appointed.
The first half of the Athens Authentic Marathon is pretty much flat. There are a couple of minor climbs, but these only last for a few hundred metres, so they can be safely taken at a constant pace.
After leaving Marathon Stadium the route is fairly straight, save for a dog-legged detour about 5km around the Marathon Tomb. On the wide-open road — made less congested by the staggered start waves — it was easy to find a comfortable pace and lock it in, following the blue racing line as closely as I could.
I even made a friend during this section, getting to chat to a Greek guy who was aiming for a similar finish time to me. So it was nice to be able to chat while grinding down the miles.
The support through this section is sporadic as the setting is quite rural, but when you run through a village there’s a massive surge in energy as the whole place seemed to be out supporting the runners. There were also children and ladies handing out olive twigs for luck, so I took a small one and stuffed it into my pocket. It was a unique souvenir for a finish line selfie!
About halfway, The Hill starts. I clocked it starting at 13.5 miles, and it went on for the next 8 miles with only a couple of short sections flattening out a little.
I was nervous about The Hill, even though I’d trained on a lot of hills back home and had simulated an 8-mile, 180m (580ft) elevation gain run a few weeks earlier. But I’d never attempted something like this after running a fairly pacy (for me!) half marathon beforehand.
My coach had recommended I do ‘something’ while running up the hill to take my mind off it. ‘Counting to four’ and ‘pretending to click pens with my thumbs’ were two techniques he suggested had been shown to take the mind off pain, so I planned to give them a go. The ‘count to four’ suggestion fit well with a breathing technique Jack Daniels, PhD recommends of using two strides to breathe out and a two strides to breathe in.
So I applied the ‘count to four’ and breathing technique for a good part of The Hill, but also took the opportunity to learn a bit of Greek from my Greek running friend. I learned how to say ‘thank you’ (‘Efharisto’ or Ευχαριστώ) and tried it out on the crowds, with him correcting my terrible pronunciation so I could try again later.
I think I got it in the end!
For all the worry I had about The Hill beforehand, it turned out to be absolutely manageable. My highest elevation gain over one mile was 138ft (42m), but most miles had an elevation gain of just 50–60ft (15–18m).
My race strategy worked a treat through this section and I was actually ahead of schedule by the time The Hill ended at kilometre marker 31… but not before the most brutal segment, where you run down — and then back up — a motorway fly-under, which was a killer. But once you’re over the top, the road bends to the left and you can see it’s all downhill from now on.
At this point in the race, more than 20 miles in and knowing the hardest part was probably over, it was a bizarre feeling. But I’d had some sage advice from people who’d ran the Athens Authentic Marathon before, who told me:
Don’t put your foot down too quickly after the top of The Hill as many people who do this end up collapsing
After running uphill for so many miles, the sudden change in terrain puts a strain on different muscle groups as you head downhill, and for many people their knees just give way, and they collapse. After running so closely to my race plan up until this point, the last thing I wanted was to put my foot down too hard and fall over, so I gave it half a mile or so before increasing my pace.
The End Bit isn’t all downhill, there are flat sections and a sneaky incline just before the final turn, but the support really ramps up to cheer you on. Entering Athens was an incredible buzz, with massive support either side of the course and a lot more cheer stations as well.
And after that last turn, it’s another downhill segment straight into the Panathenaic Stadium and finish line. This must be one of the most charitable ends to any race I’ve ever ran as you can give it all you’ve got left without worrying about making it up another hill or round a tight bend.
It was fantastic!
And ending in the Panathenaic Stadium — location of the first Modern Olympic Games in 1896 — really is something to behold. And you’ll want your best smile/ grimace on as you enter the stadium as the finish straight is littered with photographers snapping away at your sprint finish.
Then it’s time to grab your medal — the 38th running has a fabulous double-sided medallion with Philippides on one side and the Panathenaic Stadium track on the other.
I can honestly say this race is up there with the very best, a cracking course and an exceptional finish line. I’d do it again without hesitation!
Coming back to my race strategy, I’d pondered it for months as The Hill means you must adapt your race plan from what would be considered ‘best practice’. Running even splits isn’t possible on this course as the elevation changes so vastly, while keeping your powder dry for later in the race seems like a waste considering the first half is flat as a pancake and you’ve got the benefit of miles of downhill segments at the end to sweep you through to the finish line.
My target was a Chicago Marathon time qualifier time, so I needed to come in sub-3:20.
I’d also ran a PB in a virtual marathon the previous year in 3:18, so my goals for Athens were to nail a Chicago Marathon time qualifier spot and, if possible, chalk up a new personal best. This meant my goal pace was about 7:34 mins/ mile over the marathon distance, but even splits were out of the question due to the 180m (560ft) of elevation on the 8-mile stretch of The Hill.
I didn’t know how much The Hill was going to take out of me, so I set a pace range for the last 5–6 miles, knowing if I was in that ballpark I’d hit my goal.
My race strategy looked like this:
· First Half: 7:00 mins/ mile
· The Hill: 7:30 to 7:45 mins/ mile
· The End Bit: whatever I had left in the tank, but as close to 7:00 mins/ mile as I could manage
This left quite a bit of wiggle room at the end as I knew I’d tire but didn’t know by how much.
The First Half went 100% to plan, I maintained a steady 7:00 mins/ mile throughout (even having to pull back my pacer friend at times to stop me from running too fast!) and hit The Hill bang on target.
To my utter amazement, The Hill turned out to be a lot kinder than I’d anticipated. I managed to hold a 7:20 mins/ mile pace for large portions of it, slowing only to 7:45 mins/ mile for the really steep sections, which were thankfully few and far between.
And for the End Bit, I managed to pull back to 7:00 mins/ mile for a couple of miles before fatigue set in and I dropped back to 7:30 mins/ mile. But hitting that last 800m downhill home stretch I accelerated to 6:45 mins/ mile to cross the finish line, which shows you just how charitable that last segment is!
I finished in a time of 3:08:31, way ahead of both my goals. My time was also a Boston Qualifier time and would’ve got me into the 2022 running but unfortunately the Athens Authentic Marathon was 48 hours after the close of the Boston Marathon qualifying period.
But there’s always another chance to improve my time and get that BQ next year!
I can honestly say this was one of the best races I’ve ever experienced. The course was incredible, gave you lots to think about and was an energising mix of quieter segments followed by raucous support as you ran through the towns and villages — and then Athens itself.
If this race is on your bucket list, I’d highly recommend signing up and living your dream.
You won’t be disappointed!

Airbnb has effectively created a new category of rental housing. This new category — called ‘short-term rentals’ — exemplifies a software-driven, platform-mediated market that occupies the gap between traditional residential rental housing and hotel accommodation.
A prime example of the corporate sharing economy, the American company operates an online marketplace and — with nearly 5 million listings in 81,000 cities and over 300 million check-ins — it has established itself as the world’s largest peer-to-peer hospitality intermediary. Guests benefit from the ease of use, decent rates, access to peer reviews, and a variety of housing options in neighborhoods not traditionally geared to tourism. Hosts benefit from the access to a huge audience, flexible living arrangements, and a steady flow of extra income in these times of economic crisis.
Nonetheless, Airbnb’s impact on cities and housing markets is not immediately obvious.
On the positive side, the company claims that the short-term rental market increases tourism and its economic benefits. It also provides additional income for hosts, particularly those who would not otherwise rent out their housing unit or rooms to longer term tenants, while benefiting neighborhoods that tourists traditionally do not visit, bringing additional customers to local businesses.
On the negative side, local communities and housing advocates point out that Airbnb is making it easier to illegally rent out apartment units to tourists, while taking those units off the market for full-time residents and driving housing costs higher, negatively affecting the quality of life in residential areas.
Accordingly, hotel associations are concerned that short-term rentals function as hotels but have an unfair advantage because they don’t pay taxes and violate safety and zoning regulations.
Attempts to regulate Airbnb, however, have encountered a significant pushback from the company, which summons a powerful weapon through disruptive business and lobbying strategies and by mobilising its community to protest proposed reforms and expand its political influence. While Airbnb and its defenders insist that these reforms must be updated to accommodate the new possibilities presented by the sharing economy, its opponents argue that Airbnb aims to avoid regulation and taxation, and threatens affordable housing in cities.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, was founded in 2008 as a way for people to easily list and rent out their spare rooms or their homes online. There has been a widespread concern, however, that a large amount of the activity on Airbnb is not ‘home sharing’, but rather a new form of de facto hotel that fuels gentrification and displacement.
In response to this concern, I set out to find how Airbnb is really being used in and affecting the Greek capital.
To understand the impact of Airbnb on housing in Athens, I downloaded and analysed a dataset compiled by the independent, non-commercial monitoring service Inside Airbnb, which tracks the flow of ads on the online platform.
The data covers the city centre of the Athens urban area, the largest in Greece and one of the most populated urban areas in Europe, sprawling across the central plain of Attica. The study period is May 26, 2009 — May 9, 2017, and every Airbnb listing which existed at any point in this period in the city centre of the Athens urban area has been included in the analysis.
In 2017, there were 5,127 listings reserved at least once on Airbnb in Athens — a 6.8% increase from the previous year (4,801 listings), and a 56.5% increase from 2015 (3,275 listings).
It is not the case that there are 5,127 listings receiving reservations, but rather the fact is that, on average, half of the listings available in Athens in a given month receive at least one review from a guest.
Serving as the glue of the community, reviews can be used as an indicator of Airbnb activity. This metric lets hosts or guests to leave a detailed review of their experience. Receiving a positive review from a guest is absolutely vital for a host to have more reservations and they usually encourage guests to leave a review. According to Niels van Doorn, Assistant Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam and Principal Investigator of the Platform Labor research project, “such ratings have become a major decentralized and scalable management technique that outsources quality control to customers of on-demand platforms, creating a generalized audit culture in which service providers are continually pushed to self-optimize and cater to the customer’s every whim.”
Indeed, serious Airbnb entrepreneurs may well refurbish their units to increase their success with the service. But still, the only necessary step for converting a long-term rental to a short-term one and for scoring quick money through Airbnb is just to evict the existing tenants, or not replace them when they depart.
Before proceeding, let’s remind ourselves that helping each other out by sharing our rooms or houses is one thing while commodifying them by charging a fee for their use is quite another. And this leads us to the more innovative aspect of the sharing economy, which is to disturb our material reality; according to author and critic Sebastian Olma, “to coordinate supply and demand of products and services that in their present form were previously unavailable on the market;” in our case, to allow people to sublet their houses.
It seems quite obvious, then, that, despite Airbnb’s outreach focus on small scale and occasional uses of its platform (the way, for example, that homeowners can pay their household regular expenses by hosting guests occasionally), most regulatory scrutiny of short-term rentals has been focused on entire homes or apartments. Of course, this scrutiny is not just limited to the room types in a given area — especially when it comes to Athens, where most of the listings are entire homes or apartments — but it is also extended to a listing’s availability and activity.
An Airbnb host can setup a calendar for their listing so that it is only available for a few days or weeks a year, while other listings are available all year round. Depending on its availability and activity, a home converted to full-time Airbnb use could be more like a hotel, disruptive for neighbors, taking away housing, and thereby fuelling gentrification across the city.
Yes, 91.6% of the Airbnb listings in Athens are available for more than 60 days a year. Keep in mind that the calculation of availability for each listing through insideairbnb.com tracks whether a listing is reported as available or unavailable on its calendar. This approach does not differentiate booked from unavailable properties, which means that the statistics could have underestimated the availability of properties.
Short-term rentals may also impact the housing shortage in Athens by offering a more lucrative alternative or a more flexible living arrangement to listing a unit on the long-term rental market.
With an average price of €55 per night across Athens, it would not be a hustle for some landlords to evict a tenant for the financial benefits of entering the sharing economy, right? The essence of sharing, however, does not involve the exchange of money. Again, sharing only happens in the absence of market transactions.
This is why the image of a family occasionally renting a spare room in their home, or perhaps renting their entire home for a brief period of time while they are out of town, is not representative of Athens anymore (as if it ever was).
But how can we distinguish commercial from occasional operators?
One way to do this is to look at hosts who have multiple listings on Airbnb. By definition a commercial operator is a host with more than one entire home listing, since only one of their listings could be their primary residence.
Estimating commercial operators this way will dramatically underestimate their numbers, since it will fail to identify hosts who have a single listing which is not their primary residence and which they run as a business. It will also fail to identify hosts who operate their listings via multiple Airbnb accounts. It is a useful first approximation though.
A ‘multi-listing’ is, thus, defined as an entire-home listing whose host has at least one other entire-home listing, or a private-room listing whose host has at least two other private-room listings.
Commercial operators that control multiple entire-home/apartment listings or large portfolios of private rooms are a 43.8% of hosts in Athens.
Here’s the top 10 of them for 2017:
Most discussion of Airbnb’s impact on housing availability and affordability focuses on entire-home listings and for good reason. These are the listings which, if rented sufficiently often throughout the year, can no longer be housing a long-term tenant. Private room listings, by contrast, are generally assumed to have little if any impact on housing markets, since they generally do not displace renters.
If we look at groupings of private rooms rented by a single host in the same building, or in what the Canadian housing advocacy group Fairbnb has called ‘ghost hotel’, this assumption is clearly false.
Most ghost hotels in Athens comprise 2 to 5 private-room listings. The most striking fact about Athens’ ghost hotels, apart from simply their existence, is that one of them has 40 private-room listings and that it is a real hotel.
Among others, ghost hotels in Athens include:
I have noticed that when there is a discussion involving affordable housing and Airbnb in Athens, someone will come forward and reference Koukaki as the #1 exclusive AirBnB zone in the city. Almost true, given the small size of the area.
Following the neighborhoods of Plaka and Exarchia, Koukaki ranks third on the Airbnb chart of Athens with 343 listings, and fifth on Airbnb’s top 16 neighborhoods to visit in 2016, with 801% growth from 2015.
FYI: at the time of this writing, there are only 65 apartments available in Koukaki on www.xe.gr, the leading long-term rental platform in Greece.
As you might wonder, ‘#1 Event Venue In Athens | Acropolis View 360°!!!’ is the reason why Kerameikos is the most expensive neighborhood in Athens.
With an average price of €85 per night, Plaka ranks as the #2 most expensive neighborohood in the short-term rental market of Athens, followed by Pentagono, Rigillis, and Zappeion with €81, €75, and €74 per night respectively. I was hoping to see Kolonaki in the top 5, but it’s just #6 with €72,4 per night on average.
Taking those metrics one step further, the map below illustrates the distribution of all 5,127 Airbnb listings in the city centre of the Athens on May 9, 2017. Each circle represents a listing. The size of the circle is the listing’s price per night, and the colour is the room type.
Lastly, let’s take a closer look at the 5 neighborhoods with the greatest concentration of Airbnb listings in Athens.
Hopefully this data adds a bit more evidence to the discussion around the dominance of Airbnb in Athens and how it has become a symbol for quick value extraction. Now, the question is: How can we make the transition from a corporate consumer-driven to a citizen-centric sharing economy?
I’d love to hear your examples of non-profit, community-based alternatives and how they support forms of exchange that could actually be called sharing.
Notes on methodology
I initially became interested in exploring the dominance of Airbnb in Athens after discovering Inside Airbnb’s dataset, and settled on this methodology after coming across UPGO’s analysis of Airbnb in New York zip codes.
Once I isolated the names of each neighborhood in Athens, I queried the dataset to search each neighborhood for available Airbnb listings (focusing on the three available room types), their hosts, availability, and price/night, among others. Using the lat/long coordinates for each listing, I mapped each listing to its neighborhood. All code is written in Python.

“What is the city but its people?”
Choosing a travel destination is always hard. There are in the world so many places to explore and to make yours, that the choise can be even hard to explain when you say to people: “I am leaving for X-city and I will stay there for Y-days”.It is even more difficult to define, once we come back from our journey, what really fascinated and attracted us during our time spent away from home, what actually hit our eyes and heart.
My wanderlust brought me to pick the capital city of Greece for my end of May’s trip, as I wanted to follow the roots of wise men I studied during my school years such as Heracitus, Herodotus, Pisistratos, Pericles, Homer, Socrates, Aristotle and many others, and to discover the origins of the modern western civilation and democracy set by the Greeks around the V century BC. And indeed the mission was accomplished.
There are many things we discuss with with our friends and relatives once we come back from a journey. The most common topics concern sightseeings, architecture, landscapes, food, activities, hotel,… All aspects related to how the place we have been has met our expectations and likes. The magic of a city, according to me, has a lot to do with the people we meet on our journey. It is indeed in this aspect that I found the city extremely attractive and fascinated, i.e. how people live their lives in the city, how much they contribute to give a special vibe and influence to their city life and how much they care about your personal opinion about their city. Even if we do not know anybody in the city we travel to, people seem to be the first attraction: how they behave, how they live, how and what they eat, what traditions they may have; all these points make the inhabitant of the city we visit special, as people give a place athmosphere, energy, identity and spirit.
I had the chance to meet spontaneosly several locals throughout my cityscape. People were spontaneously approaching me while I used to sit in bars in Plaka drinking coffee and writing my travel diary; some were even greeting me on the streets with a very warm “Kalimera”, some others were interested in knowing where I was from, what I was writing on my open diary, why I decided to visit their city,…
But even before flying to Athens, I got in touch with Alexander, a very friendly Athenian guy graduated in archeology and member of an association called “This is my Athens”. The following association does not only give tips to tourists about activities to do in Athens day and night, but provides also the chance to meet local people willing to show with their own eyes the city by bringing you around for an entire day for free.
Alexander was the greatest person I met during my trip. He did not only show me the Acropolis, Plaka, the Arch of Adrian, Syntagma Square and other highlights of Athens; he did not only brush up my previous knowledges of ancient Greek history, art, philosophy and culture, but he also showed me what he likes the most of his city: the encounter between ancient and modern, between the ancient myth and the need of modernisation and creativity Athens is experiencing today. The contrast of this gathering between ancient and modern is remarkable in Athens. It would normally disturb my outward eye while looking at the landscape. On the contrary, the day I climbed Lofos Filopappou, the Hill of the Muses, I felt a shiver of inspiration and beauty pervading my chest that I had to sit on a stone to write as follows:
“… The encounter between the Ancient and the Modern makes this city epic, as if myth, philosophy, comedy and tragedies are still echoeing in a neverending ballad with people in T-shirt filming the whole play with smartphones”.
Athens is mythical. Athens is legendary in every corner you explore. Myth and legend are witnessed not only by the majestity of the Acropolis itself, but also in its every corner by temples, columns in marble, arches and statues of ancient times. These remind all travellers of the epic past of the Greek civilazation, an unforgettable wise society who gave us the seeds and branches to create a common cultural base.
But people make Athens unically magical with they our spontaneity, with their own happiness which pervades you whenever you walk, whenever you sit at a café to drink the typical “Espresso Freddo” (cold espresso with foam). Every tourist can witness such in Plaka neighbourhood, a happy island located in the heart of Athens, where serenity and love for live take over the chaotic vibes of the centre of the city. In Plaka Athenians turn Athens at its best by chilling on the stairs drinking and chatting with friends, or even with strangers as it happened to me almost everday. In Plaka, the wonder of the place may turn your Athens experience into an unforgettable experience thanks to the athmosphere people have the power to create. As William Shakespeare once wrote: “What is the city but its people?”. If thanks to people we are all able to establish a connection between the city and its inner deep soul, the answer to the following Shakespearean quote might be “nothing!”, as the magic of the place cannot be separated from the soul of its people.

TRAVEL TIPS FOR YOU. THIS IS MY ATHENS. Organisation for free walking tours with local people introducing with their own personal way the vibes of their city: http://myathens.thisisathens.org/
STAY. If you are a young and easy lonely traveller like me, looking for the cheapest but best location in every town, I can recommend “Pella In Hostel” , a great place where to find other backpackers and a great place where to chill from 7pm on the roofterrace which gives you a great view on the Acropolis, especially at sunset. WiFi available. No breakfast or meals. Bed available at average price of 16,- EUR/night https://www.facebook.com/Pella-Inn-145570978875281/
EATING AND DRINKING OUT. In Athens travellers find a huge and never ending varieties of restaurants and café offering typical amd exquisite Greek food. Here a selection of the best places I tried.
Melina Café, a café dedicated to Melina Mercouri, a world-famous Greek actress, active in the resistance movement against the military regime which ruled over Greece from 1967 until 1974. The café is situated on one of the many streets of Plaka Neighbourhood and offers a good selection of typical Greek food and beverages. Here I recommend the typical Espresso Freddo and a snack. WiFi available. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Melina-Cafe/202235353129523?ref=ts&fref=ts
Dodos Archaias Agora, Nice restaurant located almost in the middle of a huge row of other bars and restaurants on Agiou Filippou. I went there on the first nicht in Athens with two Italin girls I met in the first evening at the hostel. Great food, Retsina wine was excellent and the waiters were all very kind, with a great sense of warm hospitality. Here you can get a good meal with wine for 15,- EUR per person. WiFi available. https://www.tripadvisor.at/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1076890-Reviews-Diodos_Archaias_Agoras-Athens_Attica.html
Yasemi Café Bistrot. According to my personal experience, this is the place where you can enjoy the unique life of Plaka district. While spending your time at Yasemi you can decide whether to sit at the standard tables or on a pillow on the stairs, as the tradition of Plaka wants. Yasemi offers a good selection of warm and refreshing beverages, from coffees and teas to beer and Greek wine and a good choice of snacks and easy Greek specialities to bite after a long walk around the Acropolis or just around the city. In few words, the best place to experience the true chilling Greek life. WiFi available. http://www.yiasemi.gr/

This is the next installment on my trip report from my February trip to Athens and Israel, experiencing the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens. If you are just joining, catch up on how I planned and booked the trip and prior reviews of the Emirates business class flight from Newark to Athens and the ground experience and the SAS Lounge at Newark.
The InterContinental Athenaeum Athens is located in the Neos Kosmos neighborhood of Athens, just off the Syggrou highway. The immediate area feels a bit run down and there was a variety of businesses and old buildings. My impression is that most of the guests were attending meetings and events at the hotel’s conference center.
The hotel has over 500 rooms and suites, and several restaurants and bars. There is also a pool and extensive conference facilities.
I booked the hotel for 24,000 points a night using points earned from the welcome bonus on my IHG Rewards Premier Credit Card. IHG One Rewards are a fairly easy currency to get and are a 1:1 transfer partner from Chase Ultimate Rewards.
stayed for just 3 nights, and the public rate was about 170 euros per night.
I primarily chose the hotel because it seemed well-regarded and was available on points. While it was easy to get inexpensive cabs to the center of the city, for those who want to walk or use public transportation, I would not recommend this property as a good base for touring.
The hotel website does advertise a shuttle to the city center, but it didn’t seem to be available during my stay.
The ride into Athens was pleasant and the traffic late Sunday afternoon wasn’t too bad. When we arrived at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens, there were several bellmen up front and I was quickly assisted with my luggage.
I have IHG One Rewards Diamond Status but inside, there was no clearly marked elite check-in. That said, the line was not long and I was seen quickly.
I was thanked for choosing to use my IHG One Rewards Points at the hotel and for being an elite member of IHG One Rewards. I was informed I was upgraded on account of my status. However, I was not proactively offered late check out or free breakfast, a benefit of Diamond status in the recently overhauled program.
But when I asked, I was promptly advised of the free breakfast benefit. At this property, the breakfast is a buffet in the lobby restaurant.
The lobby had an interesting sculpture and plenty of seating as well as a bar. The bar seemed to only be open at night, and I did not visit during my stay.
I booked a king classic room on points for this stay. At check-in, I was advised that I had been upgraded to a city view room, which sells for about 50 euros per night more than the classic room.
All in all, not the most exciting upgrade but not unsurprising for IHG. Despite advertising the potential for suite upgrades, IHG does not proactively upgrade Diamond elites in the way World of Hyatt does for Globalists.
After check-in formalities were complete, I was given my room key and sent on my way. I was assigned to room 514.
To get to guest room floors you need to scan your key at the elevator, something I was not advised of at check-in. I found my room quickly and a few minutes later, there was a knock at my door with my bag.
I have stayed at several InterContinental properties and the room felt like some of the others. The decor was nice and unoffensive.
True to its name, the window had an uninteresting view of the city. The blackout curtains on the window were fantastic, something I have found rare these days.
There was a nice sitting area with a couch and coffee table, as well as a proper desk area. I have found that many hotels are cutting desks out of guest rooms in recent years so I definitely did appreciate the desk.
The bathroom had a bidet and bathtub/shower.
Toiletries were in fixed big pump bottles, locker room style. As seems to be standard for InterContinental, they were by Byredo. This is one of my favorite brands, so it was great to see that.
Unfortunately, the bathtub/shower had only a half piece of glass sheet instead of a proper door, a hotel design trend I really hate. My preference is for floor-to-ceiling walls or sliding glass doors.
The bathroom had bathrobes hanging, and in a drawer in the closet just across, there were slippers, which is a nice touch.
I didn’t get pictures of the closet space at the front of the room, but there was a nice amount of storage space as well as a safe. There was also a minibar and an electric kettle with coffee, tea and mugs.
The bedding was fairly comfortable and I slept well on it. As noted the blackout curtains were fantastic and shut out all the light from entering the room.
I didn’t use the couch & sitting area much, but I did appreciate having the extra space.
Wifi was free for IHG Rewards members who booked direct, which is standard across many IHG properties. While IHG does not offer complimentary water for elites as some other programs do, I have found some InterContinental and Crowne Plaza properties offer it anyway. This was not one of those properties.
Diamond elite members get free breakfast at Cafezoe, which is on the lobby level and open from 6:30 am to 11 am daily. When I went down, I was seated pretty quickly and never found the restaurant to be too crowded. It did though take some time to be acknowledged by the wait staff and be offered coffee.
This did not end up making much difference. The coffee was pretty mediocre. There was a nice buffet on the side of the dining room as well as a made-to-order egg station.
The breakfast buffet was quite extensive, featuring waffles and French toast, several other hot items, and a rather good selection of fresh produce. There were also several cheeses and meats, and a good selection of cereal.
The end of the buffet had a bread station and a good selection of breakfast pastries.
Keeping kosher, I did not eat much but found that the produce was fine. I asked some of my fellow guests what they thought and the consensus seemed to be the food was meh, and not as good as it looked.
The hotel advertised a fitness center and spa, though I never visited them. The hotel has an outdoor pool, which was not open during my visit.
February is typically the coldest month of the year in Athens, and the pool is open seasonally from May to October. It’s located on the lobby level, just outside Cafezoe. It’s small, but it looks like it would be rather nice on a hot summer day.
Given the small size of the pool deck, I imagine it wouldn’t be easy to score a lounge chair.
All of the staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful, though service was definitely the most proactive or personalized. But I wouldn’t really expect proactive or personalized service from a massive 500+ room property operated by IHG.
As noted above, service at Cafezoe for breakfast wasn’t the fastest despite the fact the dining room wasn’t crowded, but the servers were friendly.
My main gripe is that on the first morning of my stay, I woke up to a housekeeping staff member walking into my room. They did not knock. A few days later, I was taking a quick shower before check out, and a housekeeping employee also just walked in without knocking.
Staff entering guest rooms without knocking is one of my big hotel pet peeves. It should frankly be completely unacceptable at a luxury property.
Finally, on the last day, I had a late checkout and was prepping to head to the airport. After the normal checkout time but ahead of my late checkout, it felt like they were just chasing me out. Not the way to leave a great taste in this Diamond elite’s mouth. In an effort to move on to the next leg of my trip, I opted not to pursue the matter at check out or with management.
The InterContinental Athenaeum Athens is a solid property and a comfortable place to stay in Athens. The rooms are nice. For IHG One Rewards Diamond members, the treatment is okay if not particularly polished or proactive. While the immediate area isn’t very nice, it’s very cheap and easy to get to the heart of Athens. I would definitely return at the right price, but for my next visit to Athens, I think I’d prefer a more central property.

April 22nd - 25th, 2017
The Greek Island Hamburger continued with a couple days in Athens.
I’ve been pretty excited to make it to Greece, and specifically Athens, for the mixture of classical and biblical history it boasts. Athens has only exploded in size within the last century and with the economic troubles facing Greece, it sorta curled up it’s gangly adolescent body into the fetal position and hasn’t cleaned it’s room in a while (i.e. it’s dirty). But don’t be mistaken by that description — with the right expectations this city is a satisfying destination.
So what should you expect?
Open and friendly residents. If you get out of the tourist areas, most anyone will strike up a conversation with you. We talked extensively with a hairdresser, kebab business owners, and fellow bus riders.
Lots of immigrants. Like all big cities, Athens is culturally rich with Albanians, Bangladeshis, Turks, and many other regional immigrants making there way there to find work. The recent crises has made that even more challenging, and if you take time to ask questions you can learn lots about the 100s of lives that people live — all of which you likely haven’t experienced.
Countless affordable and mouth watering eats. The upside of visiting areas struggling economically are that things are cheap (and a heavy dose of moral lamenting over white privilege). We found that the tantalizing Mediterranean dishes and tastes didn’t suffer. Typically, we cook several meals but we ditched that norm and ate out as much as possible. €2.60 for a gyros, €2 for a Freddo ( iced expresso loaded with cream — a Greek regular), €7 for an overflowing platter of kebab, chicken and pork skewers, sausage, fries and salad, enough for 4 people. These prices and food were unreal. I’m thinking heavily about our return to Athens and eating my way through every street.
When we weren’t stuffing our faces, we were matching pace with your typical Athenian vacation and trying to hit every historical site the city holds, or at least each one that was included in the €30 pass.
Our tour started with the Ancient Agora of Athens — where the likes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle discussed philosophy, prodded passersby with questions, and established a framework of thinking that has been rehearsed and revised for generations. It was also the very marketplace where Paul wandered through waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him in Acts 17. His impassioned discussion of the gospel led him up to the Areopagus, or Mars Hill, where he spoke before the Athenian council.
After the agora it was up to the Areopagus and of course the Acropolis, the mountain top holy ground of Athens, where the Parthenon and other ancient structures built to honor the gods still stand after 2400+ years. Apparently they were in tip top shape until the Venetians bombed them in the 1600s and then more recently even worse — acid rain started eating away at them.
Dancing in the rain seems less romantic.
There’s loads more of ancient things scattered throughout Athens. We visited the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Library (he was a big fan of the Greeks), Aristotle’s Lyceum, and the Roman Agora. Each sparked a deeper appreciation for the concepts and theories produced during that era and prodded us to want more of a classical education for our kids. One comment I found provoking was that the founding fathers knew far more classical history than any of our current senators and representatives — I wonder how much the slide into practical education and politicking contributes to the partisan decline of Washington.
But enough of that. After two days of intense site-seeing (and eating) it was time to set sail for island life!

The most shameless Roam-clone has thrown in the towel. While predictable, it’s sad when a project closes down. It’s not fun to do and closes beautifully imagined possibilities for the team and for the public. (As a side note, though, this update seems like they left users with only an unsupported way to download the data, which would be distinctly un-classy.)
What’s next for the Personal Knowledge Space? While Athens was never a significant part of it, this is an opportunity to reflect on where we’re at and what’s coming.
The big recent trend is the sudden addition of Artificial Intelligence all over. One day, AI generated images and text were ubiquitous. The change was hard to miss, largely due to the undercurrent of panic by people who benefit from writing online, asking “Did we… all just get commoditized?”. It went from a promised future to cheaply accessible reality seemingly overnight.
The Personal Knowledge Space has long sought the possibilities of AI. You’ve got a whole mess of personalized data in there. It should be useful for key benefits like finding connections, creating summaries, and improving writing skills. It remains to be seen, however, if this influx of AI is good for the startups. When Notion lets people write a post with a simple prompt, how do startups provide unique enough value to get new users?
A good moat is both valuable and hard to replicate. Using AI to create short summaries or improve writing skills is valuable but extremely easy to replicate. It seems unlikely a note-taking startup will be able to come up with a better writing/summary model than the rest of the market. Finding connections between writing is useful, but not that valuable to most people. Tags and search do a good enough job for most people.
Mem.ai’s take is to focus on surfacing relevant content even outside of search. They will show contextual information as you are writing — and claim it’s even good at pulling in data from outside of their app (think Google Drive, Calendar, etc). It’s as good an approach as any. I think there are ways it will be somewhat useful, if not essential. My larger concern with targeting the work use-case is the tech giants seem positioned to win. Microsoft, for example, is great at getting people inside their ecosystem and is better placed to pull up relevant data. If they ever feel they will benefit from taking away Mem.ai’s access to their documents they will do it. This is also true of Google, who have been doing an impressive job making their business offerings good. (Have you seen Google docs recently? Damn! Functionality is coming together.).
One point in Mem’s favor is their “Spotlight” feature. It opens up a Command Line Interface that can do fancy things live save the URL of your current tab, start a new note, or add a note to an existing one. I like this because it’s a step towards making non-developers feel like they have the power of developers.
While the value of the AI use cases I described seems iffy, PKM startups have a huge potential advantage in that area. It’s what kicked off Roam’s popularity. Roam took off because people wanted to share the scripts (code-based and organizational) they used with others, and were rewarded for doing so. Empowering new groups of people that way builds extreme loyalty (see Excel), and startups have a better path to doing so than the tech giants. Startups can better find the small niches of weirdos that include myself and figure out ways to empower them. The real benefit is in making a small group of users more powerful, not in making things easy for everyone.
I’m hopeful we’ll get there! There’s a ton of innovation going on in the space still. Tara’s has their own concept of empowering users through advanced configuration that seems promising and new companies keep coming.

It’s a February Sunday morning. Plenty of cold and a lovely pale sun in the sky of Athens!
We parked our car in Michael Voda street and we tried to find which way to go. “Let’s go by that side” I say to him. As we walk by, I see families running hand in hand. Looking at the Church and its main entrance, I say to him: “Here we are”.
We enter the courtyard of the parish of the Sacred Heart. We stand outside — a feeling of dread is not letting us go inside the church. While we take out our cameras and shoot pictures of the statues, of the icons, of the stained glass of the church, I notice that people haven’t stopped coming in their parish. I had never seen so many young people in a church on a Sunday morning! Young parents, young women and men, children, teenagers… Everyone was there, in a crowded church where the children sang hymns accompanied by a Catholic nun who played the guitar. The priest began the Holy Mass in Polish. After all, the majority of believers in this parish are Poles who live in this district of the capital. “The Roman Catholic Greeks who still live in this area of Athens are now few. However, the Jesuits do have a daily Mass in Greek for these Greeks”, Irene told me when we met each other a few days later. The Jesuits are a living cell in this part of Athens. Poles, Catholics, but also people who really need the Jesuits’ presence live close to this area.
But who are the Jesuits?
Irene Koutelaki, Communication Officer of the Jesuits community in Greece, would give me all the information I needed for my cover story concerning the Jesuits in Greece. Our communication started by email and later on, we had many in –person meetings. Through the ten pages of Irene’s notes, we found the information that help us explore the world of the Jesuits.
“The Jesuits are a male Catholic religious Order. What characterize each Order are its spirituality and its different field of apostolic activity. So an Order can be educational, contemplative, or action-oriented when its action has to do with active involvement in society”,  Irene would emphasize to me the meaning of the word “Presence”. So we’re talking about the presence of the Jesuit order in Greece. “In every country where the Jesuits are present, there may be one or more communities, that is, monasteries or otherwise ‘houses’ as the Jesuits call them. There are two houses in Greece: one in Athens and another one in Tinos Island. “A few years ago there was another house in Syros which stopped functioning because of the shrinking number of the Jesuits in Greece. However, the building is still used by the Jesuits when a need arises. ”
Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam
“Finding God in all things.”
This is a typical phrase used by the Order and it means that God is close to people, whatever situation they live in, as long as people have our hearts open to discern His presence. The “Apostolic Preferences”, are a selection of directions focusing on the work the Jesuits have to strive for, over a period of the ten next years. They were announced in February 2019, by Father Arturo Sosa, Father General of the Jesuits worldwide, following his election by the General Assembly in 2016, after a lengthy process of discernment of the areas where there the Jesuits are called to offer their service and to work along with society around the world.
Early March, Wednesday afternoon
We arrive at Victoria Square by the train. It is already evening and we are running to catch up with Irene who waits for us in the church. Upon our arrival, I see the lights of the church switched on and I suppose that at this hour and day, there must be a Mass in Greek. “Is anyone inside the church waiting for the service to start?” I thought. Stained-glass windows radiate, while the entire neighborhood is plunged into darkness. We ring the bell. Irene opens the door for us and takes us for a guided tour to the premises of the Jesuits that lasted more than two hours.
The calling
“Every Jesuit is a different case! In the Catholic Church, we talk about a calling, a “vocation”, as we say it. The way each religious man or woman experienced this vocation, is a very personal matter”. Becoming a Jesuit is a long journey that involves years of education / training and discernment, which are meant for the novices to understand where God calls them to offer their life and work. Part of their studies is accomplished abroad, where they work as missionaries. This way, they come into contact with other cultures; they experience the problems and needs of the world. “As regards specifically our own Greek Jesuits, the oldest comes from the islands of Tinos and Syros, where there is a strong Catholic community”.
A long time ago I had asked Irene if the Holy Masses are regular. “They are celebrated daily. On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 19.00 in Polish, on Wednesday and Friday at 19.00 in Greek. The Holy Mass, of course, is performed in both languages during weekends: on Saturday at 19.00 and on Sunday at 11.00 in Greek. On Saturday at 20.00 and on Sunday at 09.30, 12.30 and 19.00 in Polish”. After a Sunday morning Mass, in a church full of Poles, I wanted to know what keeps people so connected to the Church.
The area where this parish is located — that is, Vathi Square, Victoria Square, Larissa Station — was once one of the most prosperous districts of Athens, until the beginning of the 90’s. The gradual decline of this area led a large number of residents to move to other areas of Attica, and thus the number of Roman Catholic Greeks was dramatically reduced. The result: today’s Greek parishioners are older and very few in comparison to the past, and this is easily noticed if someone attends a Holy Mass in Greek.
In the 1980s, a large wave of immigrants from Poland came to the country in search of a better life — before the collapse of communism. Many of them settled in the area. The Jesuits had to serve the spiritual needs of Polish believers, so they celebrated Holy Masses and they administered the Sacraments in the Polish language, so that they could understand. Today, Poland’s political life has changed. Many Poles who initially settled in Athens returned home as the financial crisis in Greece affected those immigrants, depriving them the opportunity to find work. Many Polish Catholics returned home, but still, they outnumber the Greek parishioners. Those who still stay in Athens have married Greeks, or Poles, and have created a family here — so their lives are here, in Greece, and not in Poland anymore, since they have lived here more years than in their home country. Their children are Greek. They speak Greek and not so much Polish.
At the same time, in the 1990s, many Albanians with Catholic background came to Athens, or atheists who were baptized, or converted along the way and became Catholics. Those Albanians, who are parishioners of the Parish of the Sacred Heart of the Savior, attend the Holy Mass in Greek.
As we are stepping into Irene’s office, we see shelves full of magazines. All these are issues of «Ανοιχτοί Ορίζοντες» (Open Horizons) magazine, of which she is the editor. I placed my cup of coffee on her desk and started browsing them, while she suggested some issues that could have some academic interest in my field. “ ‘Open Horizons’ was founded in 1900 under the name ‘Messenger of the Sacred Heart of Jesus’ and was published as such until 1975, when it was renamed ‘Messenger — Open Horizons’. In 2007 it was merged with «Σύγχρονα Βήματα» (Contemporary Steps) journal (1970–2007), which dealt with philosophical, theological, social, and cultural topics.
Today, ‘Open Horizons’ is the historical, subscription-based, Catholic journal of the Jesuits in Greece for social and religious reflection, published by the Institute for Human Studies of the Jesuits in Greece, and, together with the newspaper “Katholiki”, are the two official news publications of the Catholic Church in Greece. The mission of the magazine is to present, analyze, and inform Catholic or non-Catholic readers about the Catholic Church and how it perceives major issues of society, faith and human life, aims to their religious education and the cultivation of faith, while at the same time it aims at strengthening fraternal dialogue with other Christian denominations and the whole society”.
“I first saw the Open Horizons magazine two years ago on Syros island”, I told Irene. “I walked out of St. George’s school an afternoon in Syros, and I saw a lot of magazines. Nobody had touched those magazines. Apparently the magazines kept being sent to one or many subscribers who were no longer there to read them…”.
“The magazine has subscribers from all over Greece and also subscribed institutions, such as charity foundations or educational organizations. Most of our subscribers are from Syros Island but we also have subscriptions from people who know and appreciate the work of the Jesuits in the field of education. The magazine’s existence, of course, is not guaranteed by subscriptions at all”, Irene told us.
People are rushing upstairs, and Irene is asking Ms. Eleni Loukou, a librarian and archivist, to open the rooms where the Archive of the Jesuit order is kept in Greece. It contains rare parchments, audiovisual material, incunabula, fermans from the Ottoman Empire and other valuable material that is waiting to be used by researchers, historians, students and other interested people. At the other side of the hall is the Library of the Jesuits in Greece which contains over 40,000 titles, and a reading room open to the public from 08.30 to 16.00 on working days. Ancient and rare books from the 15th century onwards, and books of the 18th and 19th centuries kept in the Jesuit House of Tinos were transferred to Athens, very recently. In order to display and use its contents, the Library and Archive participate in conferences, organize activities such as the “Living Libraries” a few weeks ago, and take the necessary steps to maintain and preserve the books and the Archive properly. The Library is a part of the Institute for Human Studies. The Institute is an institution founded in 2008 by the Jesuits in Athens to promote research, study and education based on scientific methodology and principles, and the Ignatian spirituality.
We close the library door, take our coffee, our notebooks for notes, and start stepping up the stairs. The lighting is not adequate; I noticed something shimmering on the stairs. I bend over to look at the small gilded descriptions that eventually write “Jesuit Refugee Service — JRS”.
Earlier I had read in the notes that:
The Jesuit Refugee Service — Greece (JRS — Greece), which is the Jesuit fathers’ service for refugees, began its operation in 2015. It is a global network of social welfare and support for refugees, migrants, victims of natural disasters and other difficult circumstances. JRS — Greece is part of JRS Europe, which is part of the global JRS International network.
Initially, Jesuit fathers offered their rooms and houses to refugees, usually families, or mothers with young children, or unaccompanied children who were drowned to see finally the mainland. In the beginning, in those rooms, they could rest for a few hours, take a bath, and be provided with food and clean clothes. Along the way, it evolved into a permanent place of residence for refugees, who have been here for more than a month, until the required documents are prepared and finally left for abroad. Here again, with the help of social workers and volunteers, refugee activities are carried out and their children are engaged in creative activities, while those who are school-age children have the necessary procedures to get enrolled in local public schools, until it’s time for them to go abroad with their family. JRS — Greece has been active since the first wave of refugees reaching Piraeus port (the biggest port of Greece) and the islands by providing clean clothing, food and essential hygiene kits to these people. Today JRS operates in Lesvos, in the camps, offering not only material assistance but also psychological, emotional and moral support. ”
We enter the refugees’ rooms. Each door belongs to a family room. I take a glance at the room with the light from where the female voices come from. Women are gathered in the kitchen while their young ones are wandering around their feet. The youngest of the group will go down the aisle to greet us with curiosity and wrap us around our feet..
“There have been very difficult cases. These women went through a lot and when they came here they had to take their lives in their hands. Many times we had to persuade them to go up to Victoria Square where the food was distributed. They were afraid to walk for a few meters. Here again they have started slowly learning about coexistence, empowerment and resolving conflicts between them. ”
“Let’s leave now because we can disturb them and interfere with their daily lives,” Irene says, whispering. We follow her while her phrase will be stuck in my head until today as I type these sentences ..
We take our things from the Irene’s office, put on our jackets and go out on the road to go to the “house” next to the Church. While entering I saw a colorful place full of paintings. A large plush giraffe warmly welcomed us.
We leave the main building. “It’s just like a house that happened to have a lot of kids.” I think. The bell rings and children of all ages pour out in the halls of the old building, with their bags and books in their hands. All ages, all nationalities, girls and boys, all religions.
Going up to the first floor, I see the kitchen. “Here Father Peter’s father volunteers to help with the children’s lunch.” Father Petros leaves the students in the classroom for a while and comes out to greet us. Having his back turned doesn’t mean he doesn’t know exactly what’s going on in the classroom. Just a little bit further I see a girl studying English by herself… “We launched this initiative in 2011. There were children on the street that did not attend or drop out of school because of indifference or difficulties such as absent parents who worked all day to support their family. These children could not live up to their childhood. It is mainly a population of immigrants who relied on their children to help them in this new country, as they did not know the language of the new country.’’ “Pedro Arrupe Youth Center” has become a place for study, personal development and educational empowerment. The purpose of the Center is also to widen the horizons of children and young people in three key areas, ‘Know-Open up-Believe’. They seek to get to know themselves through creative activities such as music, theater, crafts, and foreign languages ​​and to develop interpersonal relationships as they find themselves in an environment which is a meeting point for children from different backgrounds.
The aim is to help each child and to shape them as much as possible in a structured and enjoyable environment, given that in addition to the financial and survival problems that these children and their families face, they also have to deal with phenomena of domestic violence, against which the Center’s Director, Mrs Argiro Hadjiantoniou, has taken drastic measures. Today, Pedro Arrupe Youth Center has over 150 children, many of whom, in addition to their supportive teaching and pedagogical programs (based on the Jesuit education), are offered daily hot meals and food for their families.
“Parents sometimes work with us and sometimes they don’t. We explain to them that the Center is not a place where they can “park” their child; we want them to be actively involved. In many cases, children do not listen to their parents and we are the last stronghold”.
There is a room a little different from the others … The room of fantasy, the room of the magical world.
I walk in this room, Father Petros turns off the lights and explains to me how the magic room works. “During an internal assessment, we found that our children suffer from lack of imagination. So this room was transformed into a fantasy room. Here, with the educator who has taken over, the Center’s kids wear a hat and start telling a story the rest of the kids”.
Each day, the Center welcomes children of all ages from countries: Nigeria, Congo, Angola, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Bangladesh. “Here we work with children until 19:30 and then they can return home.” “The Center works with volunteers, mainly Greeks but also from other countries — Italy, Portugal, Spain etc. They are not necessarily members of the Catholic Church and their contribution is invaluable”. “We are often confronted with domestic violence and we have to identify it and then deal with it”. As we begin to descend to the ground floor again and greet them goodbye, Father Peter explains to me: “We didn’t include lunch time when the Center started operating. As the time passed, we noticed that children could not concentrate on their lessons. The reason was that they were just extremely hungry”. Before saying goodbye, Father Petros can’t hide his joy: “Some of our kids passed the FCE exam in English. It is an accomplishment. I wish they could all pass the exams”. Saying goodbye to them was not so easy… They gave me printed material: “Open Horizons” magazine, the “Pedro Arrupe Youth Center” newspaper, photos, the Jesuit Refugee Service leaflet. As we leave, we see the Superior of the Jesuits in Greece who is leaving to watch a performance along with two volunteers of JRS — Ellada. We bid farewell to Irene outside her office and we are about to leave. Maybe I don’t remember well… the church lights were turned off and the stained-glass windows were not lit. We get into the subway and I hold tight my bag with my notes and my camera.
July — August 2019 It took me a long time to write this article — cover story. I would like to put my thoughts and my feelings in order. What I remember is that in a degraded neighborhood of Athens where most of us have never been, miracles happen every day. I will keep in my heart the words of Father Peter and Irene. Words that reminded me it is best not to use other people’s sufferings for marketing and sponsorship purposes, of for shooting photos. Not to sacrifice the uniqueness of others and the uniqueness of their life … Because God is everywhere around us … and certainly God exists in those few square meters of Michael Voda street. I would like to thank Irene Koutelaki for her valuable help, for answering to all my questions and for gathering useful information for me. Most of the cover story information is based on her own text. If you would like to know more about what was mentioned in the text, you can find it in the following links:

I am an African American woman living in Athens, Greece. I’m used to going to the grocery store and seeing people that look like me. I am accustomed to attending events or bars and seeing other black people dancing and having fun. I grew up in a black Methodist church where the people were my extended family, my community. I would go to my mother's on Sunday evenings and have dinner with her and my grandmother, surrounded by my beautifully black matriarch.
I walk the Athenian streets in my new town feeling like I am the only black person people have ever seen. Anywhere I go, I’m stared at as if there is a giant clown nose attached to my face. In my everyday life, I am 99% of the time the only black person in the room, building, train, or party. It used to REALLY bother me to feel so isolated while pursuing my professional career, but now I choose not to give it much attention. However, sometimes the waves of missing the black community crash upon my heart.
On one particular day, while I was out shopping, I was called a N***** by some boys at the mall. I felt angry that this racism followed me here from the States. I left the mall and continued shopping, aggravated, arguing about what I…

This charming mountain village boasts stunning scenery, authentic local culture, and a unique atmosphere that sets it apart from the crowds.
When you arrive, you’ll be greeted by crisp mountain air and the picturesque sight of quaint stone houses adorned with vibrant blooms lining the winding streets. Unlike souvenir shops peddling mass-produced goods, Arachova’s stores brim with unique locally crafted treasures. Engaging with friendly vendors becomes an opportunity to discover hidden gems and learn about the local artisanship.
Instead of following a rigid itinerary, allow yourself to get lost in the charming maze of streets. Each twist and turn reveals hidden delights — a cafe serving melt-in-your-mouth baklava, a sun-drenched square buzzing with lively conversation, or an ancient church whispering tales of its storied past. Time seems to slow down here, inviting you to savor each moment like a sip of the local honey wine, rich and smooth with the essence of the mountains.

I’m perched on a rocky outcrop below the Acropolis, the Parthenon’s columns catching the last golden light of the day. Down in Plaka, motorbikes zip past tavernas where locals clink glasses of ouzo. My sneakers are caked with dust from the climb, and I’m nursing a €2 Greek coffee from a street vendor, feeling like I’ve landed in a city that’s half myth, half street party. Athens, the beating heart of Greece, is home to 3.1 million people and over 2,500 years of stories. It’s a place where ancient ruins rub shoulders with graffiti-covered bars, and siesta naps give way to late-night souvlaki runs. Whether you’re here to walk in Socrates’ footsteps, chase the perfect moussaka, or stumble into a hidden neighborhood, Athens delivers a trip you’ll be talking about for years.

Ancient Athens was a center for the arts, learning, and philosophy, the home of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum, Athens was also the Birthplace of Socrates, Plato, Pericles, Aristophanes, Sophocles, and many other well-known philosophers, writers, and politicians of ancient Greece. It is widely referred to as the Cradle of Democracy, and Western Civilization mainly due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC on the then-European Continent.
Pericles (495–429 BCE), came from an illustrious aristocratic family and was an Athenian statesman, general, orator, and arts patron. He was Pivotal in the development of Athenian democracy and the Athenian empire.
He helped establish democracy in Athens and is considered the first citizen of a democratic Athens. He transformed its alliances into an empire. Rebuild the Acropolis after it was destroyed by the Persian invasion. And many more.

Athens, the historical and cultural capital of Greece, is a city steeped in history located on the shores of the Aegean Sea. Known as the birthplace of ancient Greek civilization, this city exudes an atmosphere filled with history at every corner. On my recent trip, I embarked on a journey to explore Athens, and I couldn’t help but be enchanted by this unique experience.
Journey to the Acropolis:
Upon arriving in Athens, my first stop was, of course, the Acropolis. This ancient citadel, a symbol of Greece, is perched atop a high hill and greets visitors with the splendor of the Parthenon Temple. As I ascended to the Acropolis, walking among the historical ruins, I felt the excitement of traversing through time. Rediscovering the captivating beauty of the ancient era against the backdrop of the city’s panoramic views filled me with profound admiration.
Plaka District:
Descending from the Acropolis, I visited the heart of the city, known as the Plaka District. With its narrow cobblestone streets, colorful shops, and traditional taverns, Plaka is one of the liveliest and most charming neighborhoods in Athens. Here, while savoring local delicacies, I found myself immersed in a unique blend of ancient and modern atmospheres.
Ancient Agora and Old Town:
To delve deeper into Athens’ historical fabric, I made my way to the Ancient Agora. This was the place where philosophers like Socrates and Plato once walked. Roaming among the ruins of the Agora felt like embarking on a journey through the past. Afterwards, getting lost in the narrow streets of the Old Town and wandering among the traditional houses made me feel as if time stood still.
Modern Athens:
Athens not only boasts the legacy of ancient times but also thrives as a modern city. Central points like Monastiraki Square and Syntagma Square are lined with modern cafes, restaurants, and shopping centers. Exploring these areas allowed me to discover the modern and dynamic side of the city.
As I strolled through the streets of Athens, I savored the experience of exploring a city intertwined with history. Following the footsteps of ancient Greek civilization while experiencing the vibrant atmosphere of a modern capital was an unforgettable experience. Athens was not just a trip for me; it was a journey through time. A bridge between the past and the future was built before my eyes, and this experience will forever leave a lasting impression on me.

What makes a civilization great? A civilization achieves greatness when various facets of humanity — physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual — are allowed to blossom and find full expression.
When you look at the ruins of Athens, you see evidence of this greatness.
Many impressive cities in history have made great contributions to the growth of human civilization, but few have come close to what Athens came to achieve and represent. When I visited the city I found the testament of its greatness written in stones; in its broken columns and fallen walls.
As you reach Athens, you see its skyline dominated by a cluster of massive structures on a hilltop. These were magnificent temples, now only ruins, which towered over the city in its glorious days.
The most impressive among the structures is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Goddess Athena. Its imposing columns striving to kiss the sky stir within one the ever-present yearning to transcend our earthly limits and reach for something beyond.
For a moment transport yourself to ancient Athens and observe the Athenians doing their everyday, mundane chores; haggling over the price of wheat in the market, herding their sheep to olive gardens, plotting a…

What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.
— Attributed to Pericles, 5th Century BCE
Ancient Athens is often referred to as the birthplace of Western thought. Whilst we have a lot to thank the Athenians for in terms of the invention of education as we know it, critical thinking, science, democracy, technology and architecture, everyday life looked a lot different back then. There were vast inequalities depending on gender, political and economic standing, for one only free men were classed as citizens, with females and slaves living a much more restrictive life.
In this article, we’ll delve into what life would have looked like as an inhabitant of Athens, in terms of their occupation; diet; how they socialised; where they lived and what family life looked like.
Athens, as a thriving and bustling coastal city boasted a vast array of different occupations of all skill sets and familial backgrounds. From high ranking jobs in the military, philosophical tutors, local government officials to the less well paying jobs such as fishing, farming and everything in between. Many made their living through the marketplace- the…

Talking with User Interface & User Experience Designers

--
Listen
Share
Matt D. Smith is the owner and Design Director at Studio Mds, a small independent design studio in Athens, GA. He created the Float Label Pattern for digital form input fields, which is now a design standard in Google’s Material Design Guidelines. He’s a proud father of four and has led creative work for agencies and brands in the US and Singapore including NBC, AT&T, Sprint, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Dwell, Razorfish, Sapient and more.
When your friends or parents ask to you what job do you do, how do you answer?
I tell them I’m a designer and work mostly on websites and mobile apps. Everyone knows what those things are so this answer proves most digestible for a layman.
What is your background, how did you train?
I was always drawing when I was a kid. In college I gravitated towards drawing and painting and eventually made my way into the Graphic Design department at the University of Georgia. There I learned a lot of the fundamentals of design–typography, white space, color, contrast, etc. After graduating I got heavily involved in the Flash community and taught myself Actionscript 2.0. This sparked my passion for digital design.
What the web can do to make this world a better place? How did the web improve your life( if it did)?
The web can’t do anything on its own–it needs people. It’s a powerful tool to connect humans all over the world around a specific thing. The possibilities are endless.
Can you show us three examples of interface that in your opinion improved human life?
“Improving human life” is definitely subjective depending on whom you ask. I’d say a few that make my life easier are iMessage, Fantastical, and Dropbox. iMessage for short specific bursts of communication. Fantastical for its natural language input to create events. And finally, Dropbox that reliably keeps all of my digital stuff wherever I go.
On quora.com, time ago there was a long discussion in answer to the question “what is the most intuitive interface ever created?”; according to Felipe Rocha it is the nipple, in your opinion instead? (http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-intuitive-interfaces-ever-created)
Hmm, maybe fruit. It appeals to most of your senses–sight, smell, feel, taste. It serves a core human need, hunger. It’s also nutritious. =)
How is your work day type?
I get into work around 8 AM and try to write first thing in the morning before email, jumping into design, or anything else. From then on until around 5pm, it’s design, emails, etc. all day.
What is the most stimulating and challenging project you have accomplished?
The most challenging project I’ve worked on so far has been Shiplify, a commercial transportation management system. There are huge amounts of information along with the constraint of a mobile device that really leveled up my thinking and skills.
What is, among the existing digital services, the one you wanted to do?
Hah, I’m still trying to figure that out.
Many designers commit the mistake of starting a project directly from Photoshop, is there a perfect design method? What is your approach to the creative process?
Starting in Photoshop is a good way to create art, but not solve a problem. The more experience I gain as a designer, the more time I wait before jumping into a design. I start with lots and lots of questions about the problem we’re trying to solve and why.
The “design” is an important part of our analogic life. What is the role of the designer in our digital life?
The core role of the designer hasn’t changed much from analog to digital. It remains to communicate visually. The trick is to find out what you’re trying to communicate and why.
Do you believe it is important for a designer to have a deep knowledge of matters as User Experience, Interaction Design, Product Design, and Front-end development?
It depends on what the designer wants to do with her personal career, but I if she wants to be the best she can possibly be, she’ll need to have a relentless pursuit of knowledge of her craft. Learning to code, etc. will only help her connect dots easier and gain a better understanding of digital products overall.
In which way do you make a difference between User Interface and user experience?
The UX is the design in its entirety– the alpha and the omega. From the words on the very first entry screen, to a payment receipt sent via email, UX covers it all. It is holistic, from business strategy to behavioral design. The UI is a smaller portion of the broader picture that deals specifically with the parts people touch and click. The two are deeply intertwined and should be considered in parallel. Sometimes UX decisions can be enhanced by UI design and vice versa. The best UI designers will also be great UX designers. I’m not a big fan of segmenting the titles of UX and UI designer, which is why I call myself simply a designer. I do both.
What is your relationship with the developers? There are people that have a relationship of continuous confrontation and other of deep friendship, where do you collocate with respect to this question?
If you want to work well with others, there needs to be friendship and common ground. If you find yourself constantly at odds with developers or anyone else for that matter, you’re doing it wrong. There’s a degree of humility that needs to be present for people to work together harmoniously.
How do you think that your career and job will evolve in the next 5 years?
I’ll always design things. It’s my thing, ya know? With that said, I do see myself transitioning to more strategy, planning, and writing to build my own products as opposed to only doing client work.
A famous quotation of David Carson (noted American graphic designer) says: “Graphic design will save the world right after rock and roll does”.Will the User Interface Design save the world, before, at the same time, or after the graphic design?
After. UI is no savior.
What do you think about Dribbble? Is it a good way to get a job? What’s the best way to find a job as designer?
Dribbble is amazing. I’ve met great people there and it’s delivered lots of job opportunities. People often mention Dribbble as a place where people focus on shallow design and getting likes, but that’s not Dribbble’s fault, that’s people’s fault. Look at Facebook, it’s an amazing communication tool, but it becomes mind-numbing after too much exposure–not because of the software, because of the content.
Dribbble is what you make it.
What book would you advice to a Junior Designer?
Hmm, that’s tough. There are so many great books; my suggestion would be to read constantly. There isn’t a magic bullet. You have to progress gradually. One book that I’m really enjoying at the moment is Peter Thiel’s, “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future”
Always as far as advices: what tools for the design?
Beyond wireframes, I’ve become a big Sketch fanatic for UI design. I still use Photoshop regularly for different things, but Sketch is now my goto for layout out UI for a website or an app.
What tools for the projects management?
For wireframing, I swear by Adobe Illustrator. I’ve tried out most software for this purpose and Illustrator is by far the fastest and most versatile vector editor there is. In fact, I’ve created a whole blog series devoted to rapid UX design with Adobe Illustrator, which can be found at http://aiux.co

In 1867 Matthew Arnold wrote a book titled Culture and Anarchy in which he held up two saving springs of our civilization: Athens — from which we get the inner urge to “see things as they really are” — and Jerusalem, from which we get the directive “to set doing above knowing.”
I don’t know if I would draw the contrast between these two civilizational sources in the terms that Arnold used. But I do know that, in studying, teaching and loving philosophy as I do, while at the same time feeling myself to be Jewish at my self’s core, I must in some sense resemble the human type that Arnold was talking about.
On my last day of teaching at Brooklyn College, I passed around the attendance sheet for the Intro course and later found that the students had penned their own farewells. Since those attendance sheets now hang in my study, I can quote a line or two: “I am sure that, speaking for everybody, you touched many minds and lives. Thank you for portraying philosophy in such a user-friendly way …” or again, “Just know that you made a difference in many peoples’ lives, especially mine.”
It’s in the light of recent developments on university campuses that I’ve cast this backward glance over the terrain of my working life. What did it feel like to me, to work in the precincts of the academy — the House that Plato Built? What did it mean to me, teaching philosophy to students at Brooklyn College — that is, to young people from all over the world? My graduate school teacher of philosophy, the Straussian Stanley Rosen, described it as the disclosure of “beautiful and sacred things.” I remember Leo Bronstein — who was a celebrated teacher of art history at Brandeis — marveling, in his Russian/Catalan accents, that “the kids are forced, fo-r-r-rced (!) to learn sublime matters!”
In my turn, I viewed teaching philosophy as the transmission of a civilizational power and presence. If it was an Intro course, I would make the case for the importance to each of them of this transmission. “This will help you to decode the life you will face. It’s not true that you are what you eat. You are what you think! When you notice the way people behave, the way they frame their challenges, and the reasons or rationales they reference in explaining their decisions — you will be better able to lift out the thinking that lies back of all that.”
Sometimes I referred to the saying of Socrates that the unexamined [i.e. philosophically unsituated] life is not worth living. He meant, you’re not making the best use you can of your time here if you can’t identify and make good use of its philosophic assumptions. It’s not about choosing the “best philosophy” to live and steer by. They all have limitations or shortcomings, as does any attempt to understand a topic. No topic can be plumbed to every depth conceivable. But to know how to get to the available depths and to plumb that is a great power — empowering in the best sense — provided that (as with any power) it’s not used for harm.
So much for recalling what it was like for me to teach philosophy to real students. That said, we can fast forward to the present. What is it like to perceive young people who wear the name of “student” but mask their faces, menacing fellow students and teachers, injuring the working people who keep their academic classrooms and buildings functional? To what can I compare the predicament of a real teacher facing such defilements? Perhaps to the situation of a farmer whose field has been sown with salt and rendered barren by those means?
And what would I say to the so-called students who seem to relish doing precisely that kind of harm? If you attack the precincts of learning and teaching, you desecrate your own ability to learn or later to teach what you learned. You will still be able to be indoctrinated, and to indoctrinate others, but you can’t learn and you can no longer teach what you learned. And it’s not merely self-harm that you inflict. You injure your city, your country, your civilization. The wound you inflict has concentric circles of wounds that lie all round it.
And as for me, I wouldn’t know how to cure such wounds. Whatever healing modalities I possess — they don’t stretch that far.
At present, I have yet to reroute my life so that the powers I’ve acquired have some further riverbed channel down which to flow. I can’t just stand at the river’s edge and forever shed tears for what’s been lost.

The renowned masterpiece “The School of Athens” by Raphael captivates viewers with its iconic central portrayal of Aristotle and Plato, gesturing downwards and upwards, respectively. The canvas is a tapestry of intellectual luminaries, featuring figures like Heraclitus in a crouched pose beside a sturdy marble cube, and the revered Socrates and Pythagoras. The room is further enriched by the commanding presence of two statues in the corners — Apollo, the god of light and music, gracefully holding a lyre, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom (or her Roman counterpart, Minerva). Intricately weaving together the threads of knowledge, Raphael’s brushstrokes breathe life into the embodiment of wisdom.
As aptly articulated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Raphael paints wisdom.”
However, there is a lesser known ( and more disputed — arguably the most interesting) figure, dressed all in white, almost set apart from the rest of the painting and looking straight at us, as if Raphael was inviting the viewer to look more closely at this figure in his crowd of mental giants. This figure is often noted as Francesco Maria della Rovere, duke of Urbino (1490–1538). However important being a condottiero might have been, it seems that this particular persona would be a misfit in the room of eternal wisdom. Others argue that the feminine presence of this figure is indisputable, and that figure is in fact Hypatia of Alexandria, a Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, long forgotten and being revived by Raphael.
Hypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator, and best known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy’s Almagest (treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths). As noted, her philosophy was Neoplatonist and was thus seen as “pagan” at a time of bitter religious conflict between Christians (both orthodox and “heretical”), Jews, and pagans. Following the accession of Cyril to the bishopric of Alexandria, Hypatia’s fate suffered a brutal death.
“They dragged her into a building known as the Kaisarion, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using ostraka, which can either be translated as “roof tiles” or “oyster shells”. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire Unfortunately, all Hypatia’s work is lost except for its titles and some references to it by some of her students, reconstructing thus her contribution.”¹
However, back to Raphael’s painting — how can we know that is truly a woman being depicted there when the very figure of Hypatia was emblematic of heresy in the circle of the church ?
“At the same period, there was a common practice artists used, Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo each sketched full-sized cartoons of their large murals on the paper and pricked tiny holes along the contours. They then would blow charcoal through tiny holes onto the walls beneath. Each charcoal “sketch” blown onto the wall would lay the figured groundwork for the intricate painting that followed. When the mural was complete, the cartoons themselves would often be destroyed.”²
However, luckily, Raphael’s complete cartoon for School of Athens has survived and is considered “the most remarkable object of its kind surviving from the Renaissance”. In the cartoon, in a roomful of men, there is only one figure wearing a veil, a classic and common article of clothing used in depicting women in Renaissance paintings. The same veil is not present in the final painting — given that most final works needed somehow the approval of the ruling caste.
In fact, The School of Athens is part of a much larger masterwork, representing only one wall of the most brilliantly illustrated room in history — the Stanza della Segnatura, one of “Raphael’s Rooms” in the Papal Palace of the Vatican. For the first two centuries after it was created, this stanza, a private library to the popes and was only seen by the eyes of the few elite elders in the heart of the Vatican Church.

It takes place in silence, mainly as the people who are supposed to safeguard it remain too preoccupied to see what’s going on.
And that is the bitter lesson of Ancient Athens. Now America is suffering from the same blind spots.
It’s history repeating itself and rhyming with a harsh cadence.
Here’s why two democracies, old and new, might be more alike than we realize.
Athens made something radical: a body of language nobody on this planet had ever seen or heard.. government of the people, by the people.
Voting assemblies. Citizen juries. Laws that treated everybody the same, that is, at least if you were male and free.
By today’s standards it was not fair but it was a beginning.
Like America’s beginning wasn’t perfect — but it was constructed to get better.
Both systems were built on faith as much as bricks.. after people stopped caring, everything wobbled.
Lowerclass Athenians were given a voice by Pericles, who paid them to serve. That widened access.
But what it opened is the door to louder voices, not smarter ones.
As the conversation of leaders descended the crowd was humored.
Applause lines started wars. Justice was about winning a popularity contest.
It was all spectacle. And spectacle requires a villain.
America’s founders were obsessed with history.
They saw what had gone wrong in Athens and tried to slow things down through checks, balances and staggered elections.
The system functioned when people believed in it.
And now the crack is beginning to show in the walls.. Rules that are not violated but rejected.
There’s a rhythm to the drift of democracies. The lyrics are different, but the chorus strikes the same chords.
Athenian Breakdown
American Parallel
These are not symptoms in isolation. They’re a trendline.
Although this time around Athens surrendered to oligarchs after losing a war.
The Thirty Tyrants ruled brutal and short-lived, but that’s all.
The people fought back. Democracy returned.
But it limped.. not marched. What came back wasn’t what it was.
Athens was then given a second chance. It simply wasn’t strong enough for them.
There aren’t any mobs storming the assembly with swords.
No decrees, no coups..just slowbmotion neglect.
Democracy crumbles not when buildings fall in one big blow but when cracks are left unfixed.
And the tools to repair it aren’t glamorous. They’re tedious. Uncelebrated. Necessary.
Athens didn’t fail because it was flawed.
It dropped because too many trusted that it wouldn’t.
America has its warnings. They’re loud.
The resolution depends on whether we are listening to them or are the ones scrolling past.

Review of The Dave Red Athens — April 2025
Check-in was smooth, especially considering my name has a special character and often gets misspelled —I checked in online - No hassle this time, Plus points — which was a nice start. The hotel was clean and looked freshly presented, but there are some serious downsides you should know about before booking. Totally outside the control of the Dave hotel !
There is a hidden door in the ground floor library, You open it to a store room and a stain well come oncome on -dave red guys- like it a Bar.
The hotel is only a few hundred metres from Omonoia Metro Station, but walking those few hundred metres feels like crossing a dystopian wasteland. Junkies and people clearly struggling with addiction are everywhere — shooting up in doorways, passed out on the pavement, or stumbling around in a daze. One man ahead of me was swinging a syringe around like it was a cigarette, in broad daylight. I didn’t feel directly threatened, but the general atmosphere was intense and unpleasant.
You also see severely unwell women loitering — prostitutes— in what looks like a desperate state. Some stood motionless at corners like statues, others circled the same block over and over. It was deeply sad. The whole area feels forgotten and unsafe. If you’re not used to this kind of street scene, it’s genuinely shocking.
The room was fine in terms of cleanliness, but definitely unfinished. It had a clean, modern look — no carpets, just polished flooring — but the detailing wasn’t great. The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain.
The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain. I’ve worked in construction and can say with confidence — the floor of the shower area has no angle, no lip, and no waterproof tilting detail. It’s just a flat surface, of latex paint so the water spreads quickly across the bathroom floor. After five minutes of showering, you’ll find yourself standing in a puddle with water edging toward the bedroom. A proper fix would involve cutting a groove or sloping the floor slightly toward the drain — basic stuff that just wasn’t done.
Breakfast at The Dave red left a lot to be desired. Compared to nearby options — for example, The Stanley Hotel just around the corner — it was dismal. The Stanley offers a proper buffet with a rotating toaster, beautiful sour cherry syrup,for your Greek yoghurt, fried bacon, tiny sausages, scrambled eggs, and a few other hot items. The Dave, by contrast, felt like a bit of a cost-cutter.
They had boiled eggs, but no scrambled eggs — maybe because that would’ve required just a bit more effort. Overall, it gave the impression of trying to appear trendy while quietly cutting corners. if it cn be wheeled out of a room that what we got
The breakfast room is nicely styled, but it’s let down by the details. The felt on the pool table is shredded, the plumbing is noisy and should of only int the breakfast room be covered up (you can hear when someone above flushes), and coffee is served in paper cups — . On my first morning, I managed to get a proper mug, but by the second, it was back to takeaway cups. For a breakfast I had to pay extra for, it felt more like a quick hostel setup than a hotel experience.
The Dave red clearly leans into quirky style — and to be fair, it succeeds in that. The building used to be the Communist Party headquarters of Greece, and I really think they should lean into that history more. There’s a massive mural in the breakfast room, but no real explanation or story told about the building’s past. That would’ve been a cool addition — Athens has history at every corner, and this building has a unique one.
The Dave is trying to be hip and alternative — and inside, it mostly succeeds. But the location is grim and the construction quality isn’t there yet. If you’re familiar with Athens and know what to expect, you might manage. But for most travellers, especially first-timers, I’d strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Safer, better alternatives: try Psiri, Koukaki, or Plaka — all still central, with far more charm and far fewer needles.
Bottom line: cool hotel, bad street, broken shower. staying in the Plaka next time.

On the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, in Southeast Europe, is the nation of Greece. It is renowned for its illustrious past, vibrant present, and iconic locations including the Acropolis in Athens, the Palace of Knossos in Crete, and the historic settlement of Delphi. Greece is renowned for its mouthwatering cuisine, which includes meals like moussaka and souvlaki, as well as its stunning islands, like Santorini and Mykonos. Greece has Greek as its official language, and it is a parliamentary republic, and the currency used is the Euro.
In the Attica region of Greece, Athens, the country’s capital and largest city, is home to more than 3 million people. With a history that dates back more than 3,000 years, Athens is one of the oldest towns in all of Europe.
The Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Ancient Agora are just a few of the famous sites that can be seen there. It is noted for its rich cultural heritage. Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates are just a few of the philosophers and well-known thinkers from antiquity who were born and raised in Athens.
Numerous institutions, including the National Archaeological Museum and Acropolis Museum, are also located in the city. Athens is a contemporary city with a thriving arts and entertainment…

Fofi: I have been heavily involved in the music industry for the past 25+ years as a DJ, radio producer, consultant and music journalist in various media outlets, specializing in electronic music. I started DJing professionally when I was 16, so I experienced the difficulties that a girl had first hand, trying to make it in a (local) man-dominated industry, needless to say female DJs were a scarcity at the time — it was so difficult to find a role model to be inspired by, look up to, reassure in some way that there was a future, a possibility for a career out there for me. I had to work extremely hard, rely only on myself, constantly prove that I deserve to be there, belong there over and over (and maybe still do today), until I finally got to a point of being able to exclusively live by my profession.
Greece is quite behind in matters of equality, so at some point I decided that I had to give back, I did not want other people and especially girls having to go through what I went through to get somewhere. So, I created HER project. It was a very lonely ride at first, but luckily I met Virginia at a HER party. I detected her drive, our common values and ethos, which led me to decide to invite her on board. With HER project and our trajectory in music as starting points, we were more than excited to launch the Athenian chapter of shesaid.so in April 2020, elevating our initiatives and efforts on a wider and larger scale, belonging to a like-minded larger and international community.
Virginia: I started DJing and producing quite recently, my journey began in 2018 though I did listen to electronic music before that. One night I met Fofi at a HER party, where we discussed about the concept of HER as a female empowerment initiative in music. I immediately resonated with it, because I had experienced gender biased inequality and sexism from one of my mentors. HER felt like a safe outlet to me, and the fact that I am able to utilize my art to offer a safer space to minorities and do something good for our society is the utmost purpose. From then on I joined HER and along with Fofi we are trying to involve more and more women into it, and raise awareness locally. Until now there isn’t a similar initiative as HER in Greece, neither in electronic music nor in other genres. This is why we also initiated shesaid.so Athens, to reach out to the music industry cluster in general, including other genres and professionals beyond artists only.
We regularly collaborate with Athens Pride, both as representatives of gender minorities, but also as members of the LGBTQI+ community. We are always on the lookout for new, inclusive collaborations. World Pride House in Malmo had an open call for proposals, and we decided to sent in a triptych, which included a livestreamed HER DJ set along with drag performances, a live HER DJ set with VRGN, and a very interesting panel discussion on gender equality in the music industry. We were extremely happy that all of them passed. At the discussion, we are hosting 3 brilliant speakers, event planner and curator, Mirca Lotz, from Germany, psychologist and gender equality advisor, Maria Rodriguez, from Spain and Dina Liberg of shesaid.so Sweden, all of whom gave us their own valuable perspectives on current issues and future actions we could all take.
The Greek scene is buzzing — Athens is becoming a very interesting and intriguing art hub, which has been characterized as the “new Berlin”. However, the music ecosystem, as a whole, is light years away from the Berlin scene. Starting from the lack of basic state support and funds, legislations, unions, statistics, lack of professions such as artist managers, music marketers and communicators, label management, agencies, and more. Needless to say, the music industry is still not as equal and inclusive as it should be with minorities. It was only recently that the issue was even a matter of discussion — shesaid.so Athens organized the FIRST panel that addressed the subject in September 2020.
Representation of women is still not enough and the arguments range from “there aren’t enough women musicians to begin with”, “there is no equality problem, women are the ones who do not want a career in music”, to “currently the top DJs are women, so there is no need for gender equality initiatives” and more.
Greece lacks basic education on what gender stereotypes are, on what ways gender inequality appears, what actions, comments and behaviors spark inequality. It is really funny, until it was not anymore, there are many times that as HER project we have felt that we have to actually convince people here that there is a problem with equality in music.
At the same time, Greece is experiencing a huge societal crisis with a constant and very alarming rise in femicides and gender violence, especially during the pandemic, while the patriarchal system is still strong in our society. Therefore, gender initiatives are needed more than ever, and that does not apply only to music.
On a positive note, more and more people speak up, more women and minorities express their own experiences and there is less fear in sharing one’s own story. In In that sense and in order to shed light on the matter of equality in music, in early 2021 we started a video series called #HERwords, where we invite women DJs and producers to answer a few questions in a 5’ video, sharing their own experiences and advice.
Last but not least, in 2021 the #MeToo movement also made its “debut” in the country — it created a sense of shock in the general public, but at the same time it gave a tremendous feeling of strength, support and hope not only to the victims, who boldly went public with their stories, but also to women and gender minorities in general.
What we have noticed from our collaborations with international artists and professionals, as well as members of the shesaid.so community, is that even though the needs are the same, each country and region has a very different perspective in terms of equality in the music industry, and consequently the respective actions each one takes lead to different sets of milestones we need to reach, so as to achieve working in a safer scene.
Everything begins and ends with education in our opinion. Firstly, we need research and statistics — numbers to show what is really happening in each area and profession, to understand each society and then to set up a localized approach and a clear strategy based on local needs and current social situations.
Raising awareness is also a great starting point, by simply advocating for gender equality and sharing experiences. Digital outlets, like social media, have much power that we can all exploit in that sense. Storytelling has become so much easier now, and if one’s story can affect and change just one more person, then it can create a snowball effect. E.g. Rebekah’s #ForTheMusic campaign sparked discussions and gained followers ranging from artists, to promoters, to clubbers and more. This demonstrated a suppressed need, which surfaced and engaged several professionals in the industry, even though it was a bit strange that it took so long for it to happen — since it was a subject we were all discussing constantly behind the scenes -, but thank the Universe it finally did.
Taking this as a starting point and using the Morillo extremely sad incident as an example, we have to really think why it took so long for mouths to open, even though it was made clear that people knew, why we saw so many people standing by him and not the victims, in the first place, but also after his death. This has to change. We need to start talking more and on a wide scale about safe dancefloors and booths, we need more men allies. We know the problem, we need viable solutions.
Finally, actively supporting communities is also an action we can all take in our daily lives. It is not enough to remain impartial anymore. In order to improve the music industry we need to radically change our daily habits, behaviors, collaborations — we need to actively include minorities in shows, we need to actively protect them and support them, until there is no need to do so anymore.
Fofi: I am an introvert, but very skilled at socializing. Music has always been the means to express my feelings through sound, vibrations and words. I have been doing this since I can remember myself, so it was extremely difficult for me to accept that new “normality”. I hold the longest-living residency at a club in the country, being the resident of Sodade2 for the past 21 years, so I did not only lose my outlet for communication, but also my coexistence with my friends and chosen family. I cannot pick one set as my favourite, I am blessed to have had so many. My latest favourite ones are the b2b sets by me and Virginia at Sodade, when after 4 am we usually set the club on fire, but also our performance as HER project at the first Sonar Athens.
Virginia: What I love about performing live is this non-verbal vibe exchange with the crowd, a give and take, while they are trusting us and letting loose to our music. We have had some of our best nights at a local club where Fofi resides, called Sodade, where we play for hours and experiment with house, electro and techno tracks, mixing genres and classic tracks, too. Also, our set at Sonar Athens is one that I will never forget! The stage, the people, the music, the honor of being part of Sonar, it was truly a night I will never forget.
Virginia: I simply won’t do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable, disrespected, insulted, dehumanized. There is an inner voice, I believe we all have, that reminds us of who we are and warns us when we are about to compromise that. I lately listen to this voice more and more, and it tells me that I am enough for those who respect and enjoy what I have to give, and I would never compromise my values and dignity for anything further.
Fofi: Music is my life, so the way I approach music and my career is actually the way I carry myself in this world: with the utmost care and respect.
The fact that we belong to this amazing global network that consists of exceptional people changing the game in the music industry, coexisting with extraordinary, talented, vigorous, dynamic and driven people, sharing the same mindset and ethos is actually a pure privilege and gift. shesaid.so is shaping the future that transcends the music industry and we want to help in that with all our being.
Virginia: I would pick “Rub” by Peaches. Peaches has been one of my favorite artists since I was young. As a woman, listening to an artist like Peaches, her strength, her expression, her I-dont-give-a-f*ckness, has been truly inspirational. Rub specifically, was published in 2015. It has brilliant lyrics, which are an ode to what is (still) happening today. I would absolutely love to have contributed with techno versions, distortions and beats.
Fofi: “Lifeforms” by Future Sound Of London. I consider it a pure piece of art, a pivotal moment in the electronic music history that shaped the things to come. I think that listening to it, when it was released, I could actually feel my brain being reprogrammed to another dimension. The way they stretched genres and combined ambient with techno is phenomenal. Plus, if I was a part of it, I would actually be in the studio with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and then die of awe silently and peacefully at the corner.
Fofi aka Fo is a leading figure in the Greek dance music scene. She has played at all major clubs in the country, shared the decks with several international DJs and she holds the longest living residency at a club in the country, being a resident of Sodade2 BackStage for the past 20 years.
Brimming with curiosity and passion for electronic music, Virginia aka VRGN is an upcoming talent to watch. Within 2 years she has already played in some of the biggest venues in the Greek scene, sharing the decks with both Greek DJs and international ones such and also performed at the first edition of Sónar festival in Athens, in a B2B session with Fo.

There’s nothing like the open road. Possibilities unfold as the terrain whizzes by your window.
Hailing from the second largest country in the world means that road trips were a rite of passage. There’s a lot of ground to cover in Canada. Packing up and jumping in the car for a long drive to a different destination, through ever-changing seasons is a core memory for me. Driving several hours or even days means that I’ve logged a lot of kilometers on Canadian roads over the years — traversing those expansive landscapes with awe. These road trips stretched into married life for family gatherings, special events, school holidays, and glorious weekends at the cottage.
Our road trips took on a whole new dimension when we moved to Izmir, Türkiye in 2021. The roads no longer looked familiar. We drove with a sense of uncertainty and with, I must say, a slight feeling of trepidation.
Can traffic circle procedures really be that different here? Why is everyone speeding? Will small country lanes based on centuries old trails be wide enough to pass through? What if we get lost and we don’t speak Turkish?
Once we adjusted to the local norms of driving we revelled in the fact that our road…

Hello! I am Panagis Sarantos and this is the story of how the GDSC program and Harokopio University of Athens met each other for the first time — and it was quite a journey!
It all started in the summer of 2021 when I was chosen as Lead. It all happened thanks to Angelika Zaucha, community manager for the GDSC program in Europe.
Here’s an interesting story!
It was the summer of 2021. I was hanging out with my friends on a nice evening in the beautiful city of Athens in Neo Iraklio. While we were talking about our summer plans, I got a notification about a new email. I looked it up and saw the name “Angelika Zaucha” for the first time. She reached me via her personal email to ask me if I would accept the lead position because it was the last day to do that, and they did not get the response from my side.I was positively surprised. I rushed out and found all the other emails that had gone to the spam folder. I finalized the paperwork and became the GDSC Lead & Founder of Harokopio University of Athens (GDSC HUA).So… Thank you, Angelika!
First task, of course, was to form our Core Team. As a student of software engineering, I knew I could reach many developers and people in tech. But I also knew that our Club will need others to help with communications, planning and social media. After making my choice, I came up with these few useful tips on selecting core team members:
I have to say that I didn’t follow all the steps that I mentioned above, but now I know better and you should too.
It’s also important to establish a good relationship with your university and the faculty. Introduce yourself and the program to the authorities. We managed to do it, and our university fully supported all our plans and initiatives. At times it was difficult because of the pandemic, but we managed to overcome any obstacles. For example we managed to do a virtual event about AI & Blockchain for more than 260 unique viewers!
Yes, that’s right. Our first virtual event themed as “Applications of AI & Blockchain in Society & Industry” managed to hit more than 260 unique viewers. I have to tell you that I was really nervous at the beginning. We were live streaming on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms. We had guests from the industry and academia. It was quite a big hit and a pretty good experience for me personally as I got to work on my communication and public speaking skills. I’m always nervous making speeches, especially in front of a big audience. This time, I managed to overcome my fears and really learn a lot.
Solution Challenge, organized yearly by Google Developer Student Clubs, was something I knew I wanted to join right from the start, either by myself or with other members of our chapter.I felt that rush of excitement when I was watching the Top 10 chapters of 2021. I loved the idea of making a positive impact on the target group or the society in general.
We joined the competition as a team and worked hard on our solution. And we did it! Our team called “Bloodcall” got to the Top 10 Finalists of Solution Challenge 2022! It was amazing when we heard the news. Who would have thought, first year of GDSC HUA and we managed to have such a strong representation competing with so many other chapters across the world. Also for the record, we were the only Greek chapter to the Top 10, even the Top 50!
What a journey we had! GDSC was a fun and enriching experience from many different aspects:
I have to say that if you have the time during your time at the university, you should join the program, even if it seems hard at first glance — trust me, the experience is priceless. That was the journey of GDSC HUA on how it was founded and how we did in the first year of our existence. And the journey continues to the present — with new faces, fresh ideas and 2 co-leads. GDSC HUA is still active on campus and in the program. Pretty cool!
From my end, I want to thank all the members of the first core team for the amazing job we did for the chapter while also doing our best as students. Thanks: Manos, Mitsos, Thanos, Nikos, Thanasis, Alexandra, Petros and again Thanos!
I want to thank Harokopio University of Athens for a great cooperation and support. Special thank you goes to our Rector Mrs. Mara Nikolaidou and our Department Head Mr. Thomas Kamalakis.
Lastly I want to congratulate and thank again the Bloodcall team for the amazing job they did. Thank you: Thanasis, George, Stefanos and George.

The 2004 Olympic baseball stadium in Athens is currently not a baseball venue but a soccer venue. I went by in late 2012 and it looked ok. At least they are using it for a sport! See a lot of articles lately saying all the venues are falling apart or abandoned.
There is only one “main” olympic stadium still being used for baseball which is in barcelona host of the 1992 games. The 1996 olympic stadium was Fulton county stadium which was torn down,the 2000 olympic main stadium in Sydney was a showground for cattle and was only a temporary venue for the games. However west of Sydney is the 2nd olympic venue and it has been resurrected by mlb and is used in the abl league. The 2008 wukesong baseball olympic stadium in beijing and both Practice fields were reduced to rubble shortly after the games. So the Olympic baseball stadium in Athens below is still there. Maybe someday it will see a baseball game again.

For the next piece of my President’s Day getaway to Greece and Israel, I flew from Athens International Airport on Aegean to Tel Aviv, giving me a chance to check out the Aegean Business Class Lounge and the Aegean ground experience at its primary hub airport ahead of my flight to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my flight on Emirates from Newark to Athens, the Emirates ground experience at Newark, SAS Lounge at Newark, and stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked Welcome Pickups for my transfer from the InterCon to Athens International Airport (ATH). I scheduled a 2 pm pickup for my flight departing at 5:20 pm. The driver arrived promptly at around 1:45 pm. The ride to Athens airport was smooth and the traffic wasn’t too bad.
I booked the flight using American Express Membership Rewards earned on my American Express Platinum Card transferred to Aeroplan.
I found the check-in area quickly. Aegean had dedicated lines for its business-class customers as well as Star Alliance Gold customers. The line wasn’t too long when I arrived and I was served quickly.
I was not advised of any priority passport control or expedited security lanes for premium passengers. They also didn’t inform me of any lounge access despite its inclusion in my business class ticket.
There was no fast track for immigration, but I made it through pretty quickly. I didn’t initially see the signage for business class security so I got in the main line. When I did eventually notice signage for the business class line, I was already in the general line which was short so I stayed in it and did not move.
Once I cleared the formalities, I was inside the terminal. The Athens airport terminal was nicer and airier than I expected. I quickly found the entrance to the Aegean business lounge and made my way upstairs.
There were several lounges in the same area on a level above the terminal, and the Aegean lounge was clearly signed, but also recognizable from the strong Aegean blue. They are very consistent with their branding.
Curiously, the signs outside did not specifically note that Star Alliance Gold and premium passengers were welcome, as is common at Star Alliance lounges. This lounge, however, is indeed open to them and follows standard Star Alliance lounge access rules.
The lounge is accessed through automated electronic gates where your boarding pass is scanned, though staff was on hand.
Personally, I don’t mind the electronic gates as they allow quick entrance if your boarding pass is coded properly. But I do think being greeted by airline staff and thanked for your business is a nice touch that seems to be going away.
While Athens is Aegean’s primary hub, it’s primarily a medium and short-haul carrier and operates no widebody aircraft so my expectations for this lounge were measured. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the lounge, and the offerings. This is notable since I don’t think Athens sees much connecting traffic either, save for passengers traveling domestically within Greece.
The lounge was a very large space with several areas and buffet stations, with great views of the runway.
The restrooms were hidden in a corner. They were small considering the size of the lounge, though well appointed. Showers did not seem to be available.
Wifi was free and fast. Many seats were available with easy access to outlets which I always appreciate.
There was a large hot beverage area with a massive Nespresso machine and a very solid tea selection. For Americans, there was also drip coffee on hand.
I prefer cold coffee so I would have awarded bonus points if they had iced coffee or cold brew on hand, but that’s very rare in Europe, unfortunately.
A variety of mugs and glassware were available for the hot drinks. The hot beverages area also had various cookies and croissants.
Past the coffee station, there was another buffet area with a variety of pastries, yogurt, and prepared foods.
There were also salads, fresh chocolates, and finger foods. The hot food station had several items, though keeping kosher, I didn’t look too closely.
There was a great selection of beverages and a self-serve collection of wines and spirits. I appreciated that they had Greek beer and wine, and a lounge employee was happy to explain the different Greek beers to me and point me to his favorite.
There was also a selection of various newspapers and magazines, primarily in Greek. It would have been nice to see some English or international offerings though.
Keeping kosher, there was not much I can eat from the buffet, but reviews of the spread from my fellow passengers were pretty positive. I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate ahead of my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv.
Aegean does a reasonably good job with its business lounge, especially given its lack of widebody service. The space is large and comfortable space to relax before your flight. With plenty of seating, fast wifi, and ample food and beverage, it’s pretty solid for a long layover too. While the lack of showers was disappointing, there isn’t much long-haul traffic here so its less of an issue. I would not come early to experience this lounge, but I was very impressed by the offering given Aegean’s foot print.

As a lover of Percy Jackson, visiting Athens has been a dream of mine since I was basically old enough to read. I eventually decided to visit on my own as I had a writing deadline staring me in the face. On one hand, I needed to write thirty-thousand words in a week.
On the other, in that same week, I had found a studio apartment in Athens for £300. Oh! And I only had one week off my typical job. What should I do? I wondered.
Dreams were staring me down on both sides, until I realised, why not do both? So I did, I booked the flights, and off I went, laptop in tow!
I’ve travelled on my own since my first solo-inter-rail trip at seventeen, so this wasn’t new to me, but I was still nervous! As I can imagine you, reading this, would be nervous at the idea of visiting Athens as a solo traveller, especially if you’re an introvert girlie like me.
If you’re thinking about going, I bet the Parthenon is high on your list of attractions, so let’s break it down, because trust me, official guidance on this is confusing!
In this one article, we’ll be covering when you should visit the Parthenon, where to book tickets, as well as some incredible hidden gems at the Parthenon you should keep a look-out…

The Greek economy might be on life support, but at least one group in Athens is making the most of it and clearly thriving: graffiti artists. It has been suggested that Athens might be the best place in the world to be a graffiti artist right now. Or, as one of the practitioners puts it, “a little paradise for the graffiti artists.”
The city is in the middle of a graffiti epidemic. It’s a combination of high youth unemployment and underemployment, a general sense of unrest, and authorities being stretched too thin to do much about it. Frankly, the police have bigger problems. The result is an artistic free-for-all on the city’s streets.
Whether you want to call them vandals or street artists, they’ve been busy. Not all of it is new, of course, but there’s an awful lot of fresh paint adorning the walls downtown in the past five years or so. Shops, homes, bus stops, and pretty much any other wall — except, notably, places that have high security like banks and government buildings (mostly) — are covered in paint. Relatively few walls are spared.
There’s the usual scratchy hit-and-run tagging, but there’s also quite a lot that has taken real thought and effort to pull off. Some of it is youthful rebellion, some of it is political expression, and some of it is art in its purest form. And, of course, it’s constantly morphing, with new paint going over old.
And some of it is quite beautiful. Here’s a small sampling. Credit to the artists, whoever you are.
There’s a very interesting short documentary on graffiti in Athens that shows some of the painters in action. It’s called Alive in the Concrete, and you can watch it online here.

Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Peloponnesian War was the result of years of tension between two of the leading powers in the world of Ancient Greece, Athens, and Sparta. Athens was determined to build a widespread alliance that stretched all corners of the Mediterranean named the Delian League to provide protection against the Persians.
In doing so being the de facto leader they requested tribute to amass naval power and a crew to support it. Sparta was unsettled by this growing alliance and the power it wielded fearing that Athens’s intentions were more imperialistic and less a simple alliance.
By 431 B.C. the reserved feelings that Sparta held could no longer be contained resulting in a multi-decade-long war that ended with a shift of power and the downfall of Greek society. Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and the defeat of imperialistic Athens’s intentions had an ill effect on the Greek world.
The outcome of this war was more than just the decline of the once-great city-state of Athens, the rest of Greece crumbled around it. Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Greek city-states provide us with an interesting look at history, a civilization connected by language and religious belief but separated by geographical nature.
Although each of these city-states remained within close proximity of each other, and some of less geographical obstruction, little alliances were formed. For the majority of their existence, they remained and operated as individual city-states only joining in the defense of one another in times of war to protect the sanctity of their society.
Of the Greek city-states, two of them stood out from the rest and have survived the test of time by both providing their individual contributions to the ancient world which have left a lasting impact on society today. These Greek city-states were Athens and Sparta, two that could not have been more different, and two of whose internal strife would be the ruin of the Greek city-states.
The most distinguished difference between Athens and Sparta was their individual choice of government with each constructed to fit their societal ambitions. Athenians were notably democratic, which objectively defied the Spartan’s oligarchical form of government that supported its militaristic way of life.
Athens obtained this government identity following the Dark Age through the reforms of Solon who first rid the poor from debt slavery to the rich through an act of “disburdenment” a method he proudly boasts about in his poems when talking about mortgaged lands,
“He took away the record-stones that everywhere were planted, Before, Earth was in bondage, now she is free”
and when talking about citizens enslaved in foreign lands that he set free,
“uttering no longer Attic speech, So long and far their wretched wanderings And some who here at home in shameful servitude Were held.”[1]
Solon’s reforms would further establish a method of government that represented the people of Athens with his creation of a multi-tiered government to include a council (boule) of four hundred men who were chosen to hear public matters of the people before the matters were carried on to an elected assembly.[2]
Men like Cleisthenes and Pericles would help Athens to further develop its democratic progression by instilling further reforms that helped to better represent the Athenian citizens becoming an influence to later democratic styles of government to come.
The Spartan government was ruled by the few, a senate or Gerusia made of 30 members who were elected for good conduct and were “absolute masters of the mass of citizens.”[3] In an attempt to avoid corruption between the two kings and 28 council members of the Gerusia, five ephors were elected from the public to serve as moderators, and of whom did not rise within the presence of the kings as the members of the Gerusia did, for they served the people.[4]
This style of government was supportive of the Spartan way of life whose male population entered training for military service at the ripe age of 7 years old and whose service lasted a lifetime. The Spartans thought very highly of their way of life and questioned the rise of Athenian democracy regarding it as weak as evidenced by the words of Lycurgus. When Lycurgus was questioned about democracy in Sparta, he simply answered
“Do you first establish a democracy in your house,”
He further downplays the significance of democracy and further promotes the effectiveness of Sparta’s oligarchy through his analogy of two puppies, both of which were of the same kin but each had notably different upbringings, one was catered to, lived indoors, and was fed regularly, the other hunted and trained in the field.[5]
When Lycurgus later presented the dogs before an assembly of the public he did so by placing food the dogs were accustomed to before them, and as expected the house-trained dog opted for the cheap food while the hunter sought the wild hare in response to these actions Lycurgus said,
“You see, fellow-citizens, that these dogs belong to the same stock, but by virtue of the discipline to which they have been subjected they have turn out utterly different from each other, and you also see that training is more effective than nature for good.”[6]
These societal differences would end up with the two leading Greek city-states entering into an unlikely alliance when the Athenians sought protection against Spartan interference in their own government by promising King Darius of the Persian Empire “earth and water” which was a sign of submission required of all alliance seekers with the Persian Empire, and when Athens did not fulfill their promise King Darius sought retribution against all of Greece.[7]
The outcome of the Persian War was not enough to preserve the unlikely alliance between Athens and Sparta, and for the next several decades they would walk separate paths as equal to their societal differences until they met once again but this time as enemies on the battlefield.
Athenians learned from the Persian War that they were at a financial disadvantage in warfare when compared to the Spartans who were a militaristic state that had an ample supply of endless soldiers, and to the likes of the Persian Empire with a vast network of client states.
When Athens took the helm of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League that sought to protect all of Greece from future Persian invasions from the eastern Mediterranean and in doing so, they adopted the Persian method of funding war knowing that the funding that a single city-state could provide alone was not enough to yield the success they were trying to accomplish so the payment of a fixed tribute from each alliance member annually was necessary.[8]
This decision served to be favorable for the Delian League allowing them to make quick use of the funds in its continuous campaign to expel Persians from harbors across the Aegean Sea, to destroy Persia’s fleet, and to liberate Ionia’s poleis.[9]
This financial arrangement would prove to be even more favorable to the Athenians when they undermined other league members to create an Athenian Empire to which they were subject and their financial contributions allowed the funding of elite Athenian sailors and hoplites who could endure campaigns and sieges lasting from a few months to a few years.[10]
Sparta, who was the original intended leader of the alliance that became the Delian League slipped back into its isolationistic state shortly after its formation and after Sparta was replaced as its leader by Athens. Even from Sparta’s state of isolation, Sparta watched on as Athens gained momentum in its rise of becoming an empire and its ascendance into the Golden Age afforded by the funds of the Delian League’s tributes. As this unfolded Sparta’s fear of an Athenian shift into imperialism heightened, and with justification.
Athens’s transformation into an imperialistic empire is best described by a certain characteristic quality that further distinguished itself from its closest competition the Spartans. This quality is known as “daring” and encompasses Athens’s traits of restlessness and expansionism in its rise to power and is best described by Thucydides in his recording of Pericles’ Funeral Oration that occurred during the Peloponnesian War where he records Pericles’s attention to the sacrifices made by fallen Athenians whose courage, virtue, and “daring” should be a model for Athenians who have survived for it has allowed Athens to compel every sea and every land to yield to their “daring” enabling them to be immortalized through monuments everywhere of themselves.[11]
Furthermore, Athenian “daring” is a catalyst for a theory that was composed by Thucydides that he believes explains the inevitable war that happened between Athens and Sparta. This theory is the theory of Hegemonic War.
Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War is a concept that he believed to be as true as human nature and one that is to be repeated throughout all of human history with one civilization driven by three fundamental influences: interest, pride, and fear, to advance its position of wealth and power until another civilization of the same interests intervenes in an attempt to stop them.[12]
Athens’s use of its position within the Delian League as a vessel in its ascendance to power saw the city-state grow ruthless, and become an aggressive bully when its authoritative role was challenged by league members who no longer sought an alliance with them. This issue was not self-contained and true to Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War when Athens and Sparta butted heads when Athens failed to resolve conflicts of interest that created issues with members of Sparta’s own alliance, the Peloponnesian League, leading to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.
In short, the cause of the Peloponnesian War can be attributed to Athenian’s “daring,” its own justification for imperialism, and Athens’s interference in the Peloponnesian Leagues matters. Sparta tried to settle conflicts of interest between Athens and its own league the Peloponnesian League through questionable measures when it threatened the act of war against Athens and its allies if Athens did withdraw its siege of Potidaea, a rebelling member of the Delian League with connection to Corinth of the Peloponnesian League, and abstain from its imposed economic sanctions against the Megareans in all ports within the Athenian dominion, which Athens saw justification for doing because they had tilled holy grounds and received revolted Athenian slaves.[13]
Additionally, Sparta’s stern ultimatum to the Athenians was heavily influenced by one of its strongest allies in the Peloponnesian League, Corinth, who urged the Spartans to a speedy intervention to the injustices being carried out by Athens, or Corinth itself and other Peloponnesian League members would seek a new alliance to join.[14]
Moreover, Athens’s refusal to meet the terms of Sparta’s ultimatum resulted in a three-decade-long war that saw Sparta fight against the injustices of Athenian Imperialism which they successfully accomplished by standing as victors at the end of the war. However, the war had adverse actions on the Greek city-states as a whole, many fell into economic hardships as a result of the war, and some were influenced by the two prominent Greek city-states of opposing governments to carry out civil conflict against their own people.
The Golden Era of Athens and its influence on the ancient world ended, and the shift of power to Sparta as the leading Greek city-state proved to be an utter failure, as previous foreshadowed in its leading role as a member of the what became the Delian League, resulting in years of conflict to follow allowing the Greeks to become susceptible to its latter absorption into the Macedonian Empire.
Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and its overnight ascendance to hegemony over Greece proved to have detrimental consequences for all of the city-states.
Sparta, as Athens did before them, flexed its power throughout Greece proving to be just as bad or even worse for the Greek people than Athens was before them as evidenced by the choice of Sparta’s former allies aligning themselves with Athens in an attempt to hinder its control. Thriving in victory Sparta promoted Admiral Lysander to carry out an instilled aggressive policy that reformed city-state governments throughout Greece by placing harmosts (military governors) who forcibly established oligarchies as well as required tribute from all those they had conquered even though before feeling such power they had not even used coined money but now benefitted from the annual tribute of more than a thousand subjects.[15]
In response to these actions and backed by Persian money an alliance was formed between Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes who swore to defeat Sparta.[16] This conflict was the Corinthian War (395–387 B.C.).
The Corinthian War finished in a similar fashion to the Peloponnesian War with Sparta standing in victory benefiting from late financial support from Persia, when Persia switched sides leaving behind its original alliance with Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes. This would not be the final conflict between the Greek city-states in their pursuit of hegemony status, alliances would be reformed and reconstructed, and the title of hegemony would be passed amongst city-states until the mid-fourth century B.C. During this period of time, the Spartans suffered a dreadful defeat at the hands of the Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra (471 B.C.) that halted Sparta’s reign of power.[17]
This nearly century-long struggle to obtain the status of hegemony left adverse actions among the Greek city-states. The nearly century-long constant warring exhausted resources, depleted civilizations, and rendered each city-state barely capable of maintaining its own state, each becoming susceptible to rising power to the North.
The Macedonians under the leadership of King Philip II took advantage of the exhausted Greek city-states in pursuit of gaining hegemony status for his growing empire with little resistance to his efforts besides a single conflict against Athens and Thebes in 338 B.C. known as the Battle of Chaeronea. Athens and Thebes refused to yield to King Philip and the Macedonians like northern Greek city-states had done before them because as explained by the Athenian orator Demosthenes the Macedonians were not Greek or even related to the Greeks and not even a barbarian from an honorable place of mention so submitting to them was insulting to the sanctity of Greece.[18]
The defeat of Athens and Thebes by Macedonia proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Greek power. Even though they retained a sense of freedom, any influence the Greek people once held on the Ancient World through their acts of politics and foreign policy completely ceased to exist, now they were subjects to the Macedonian Empire.
The outcome of the Persian War set the scene for the inevitable war between two of the greatest Greek city-states of their time, Athens, and Sparta. Following the war, Athens accepted a position as leader of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League, with great ambitions to rid the Persian Empire from the east Mediterranean and the rest of Greece.
They were successful, to say the least, but with a stronghold on this great power, their ambitions turned personal. As the Spartans watched on from isolation following the Persian War, Athens used the Delian League for its own personal gain, in the hold of a massive and lethal navy, and with ample funds supplied by Greek city-state tributes they grew into a formidable empire.
Athens’s growth did not end there, soon they turned imperialistic, whether it was for Sparta’s own personal feelings of disdain for Athens, or its urge to protect Greece, the two city-states met with war in 431 B.C. The results of the Peloponnesian War would prove to yield irrevocable and unintentional consequences when the victor proved to be just as bad as the perceived threat they dethroned.
Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.

Echoes of Athens: Are We Repeating the Mistakes of the Past?,https://wordyvirdee.medium.com/echoes-of-athens-are-we-repeating-the-mistakes-of-the-past-b357fe81c3fb,"Sign up

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain
Centuries ago, a radiant jewel of civilization — Athens — crumbled. Not merely under the weight of Spartan swords, but under the erosion of reason, the rise of demagogues, and the silencing of truth.
The Peloponnesian War wasn’t just a historical battle. It was the death knell of a civilization that gave the world democracy, philosophy, and artistic brilliance — and then extinguished its light.
Today, as we scroll through headlines filled with disinformation, political chaos, and moral exhaustion, one can’t help but wonder:
Are we living through our own Peloponnesian moment?
The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) pitted the democratic city-state of Athens against the oligarchic city-state of Sparta in a 27-year conflict that decimated both.
Athens, confident in its intellect and naval prowess, made a series of hubristic miscalculations. It overreached, misled by populist leaders and reckless ambition, ultimately losing the war and itself.
The fall of Athens didn’t just shake the Greek world. It produced a spiritual and philosophical crisis that gave rise to one of history’s most powerful responses: the life and death of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato.
Socrates — a soldier-turned-philosopher — walked the streets of Athens, challenging assumptions, confronting power, and questioning the nature of justice, truth, and virtue.
He didn’t write. He asked.
And in a society growing fragile under the weight of war and rhetoric, questions became dangerous.
In 399 BCE, Athens condemned him to death. His student, Plato, watched his mentor die — and with that, watched the Athenian soul fracture.
Plato didn’t just mourn Socrates. He responded with a blueprint for a better world.
In The Republic, he paints a chilling portrait of democratic decay: how freedom becomes license, how public opinion overrides wisdom, and how a desire for equality can spiral into tyranny.
His solution? A society governed not by the loudest, but the wisest philosopher-kings trained in truth, detached from greed, and committed to justice.
Now, let’s fast forward 2,500 years.
Across nations, we see strongmen rising, liberties shrinking, and democracy faltering under the same forces that once undid Athens.
We call it progress. But in the quiet moments, history whispers a warning.
Plato foresaw the cycle of governance:
We are, arguably, at the fragile edge between stages four and five.
And the pattern? It’s not new. It’s timeless.
If Athens fell — and from its ashes, philosophy rose — what must we do to avoid repeating that collapse?
Here’s what the legacy of Socrates and Plato implores us to reclaim:
“The unexamined life is not worth living.” — Socrates But perhaps more urgently today: “The unexamined society is not worth sustaining.”
Athens gave us the tools to think. But when it stopped thinking, it destroyed itself.
Today, we possess far greater power — nuclear, digital, economic — but not necessarily greater wisdom.
If we let emotion eclipse reason, let division replace dialogue, and let power overpower truth, then we will fall, not because we were unaware, but because we were indifferent.
So ask yourself:
Are we the next Athens? Or will we, finally, choose a wiser path?

Thought is Western, is it not?
Then, why does the sun rise from the East?
Imminently, all the frauds I have been taught
Revealed themselves to be colonial beasts.
The Secularism of God.
In a house of lavish marble.
What once was a library has turned into the fury of charcoal.
You were my renaissance.
I could feel my heart’s pace again beat.
Knowledge may be bronze,
But you were the heart that gold breeds.
You were my revelation.
The final thread of hope in the inner child of mine.
You were my salvation.
My last supper; my bread, my olives, my wine.
You healed my wounded wings,
You watered my dying tree.
Dethroned the heartless kings
That held the ropes to execute me.
Knowledge may give power,
But you make me weak.
At once, let me in this hour
Dare to write rather than speak.
You were the art pieces I always believed awaited my thoughts.
The righteous pillars beneath all of my frauds.
The School of Athens has nothing on the stairs of Fisk.
None of the curls, the lace, the laughter, the hugs, the mist.
None of the empathetic brilliance wrapped up in a warm scarf of linen.
Hypatia’s eyes scream, “Raphael, where are the women?”
The grace I have been destined,
The bonds I have been foretold.
The youth of youths,
Only the blessed get old.
Philosophers have nothing on my friends.
None of the torture, the light, the breeze, the love, the bliss.
Athens has nothing on Beirut.
Mosque to church is holy palmer’s kiss.
Love imitates art, life imitates you.
Pieces of my heart, who else would I write to?

The sun, a dying ember in the twilight, cast long shadows across the Athenian marketplace. Among the stalls of olives and sandals, Socrates, his brow etched with the wrinkles of a thousand dialogues, sat hunched on a block of worn stone. His eyes, like pools of wisdom, watched the bustling throng, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames of oil lamps.
“Friend,” rasped a voice from behind, “the shadows grow long. What truths do you glean from this day?”
Socrates turned to see Aristotle, his beard a silver cascade down his chest, his gaze sharp as a polished stylus.
“The dance of life, dear friend,” Socrates replied, “a waltz of appetites and aspirations. We spin on a spectrum, woven of threads both base and divine — the hunger for sustenance, the yearning for knowledge, the sting of guilt, the glimmer of hope.”
He gestured to a young woman haggling over a basket of figs, her eyes bright with cunning, her smile tinged with shame. “In her, the primal barter, the dance of need and debt. Money, a cold coin, echoes the ancient whisper of sacrifice, the price we pay for survival, for power, for absolution.”
He pointed to a group of men debating philosophy under the olive trees, their voices rising in passionate waves. “And here, the fire of the mind, the struggle to transcend the limitations of flesh. They seek answers in the stars, meaning in the dust, a testament to our insatiable hunger for significance, our defiance against the indifferent abyss of oblivion.”
Aristotle nodded, his voice deep as the Aegean. “Yet, even in the shadows, there flickers a light. Ritual, the heartbeat of community, binds us together in the face of the unknown. In shared sacrifice, in the rhythm of chanted prayers, we find solace, strength, a sense of purpose that transcends the individual.”
He looked towards the temple on the hill, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. “But the shadows grow, Socrates. The marketplace, once vibrant with the hum of shared stories, now echoes with the click of screens, each a window to a solitary universe. The third space, the crucible of connection, fades, replaced by the atomization of the digital.”
Socrates sighed, a rumble in his chest. “A new dawn approaches, friend, a dawn where ghosts of information dance in the ether, and the stories we tell ourselves become the scaffolding of our reality. We must choose, then, with clear eyes and open hearts. Will we build walls of data, fortresses of self, or will we weave tapestries of shared experience, where the echoes of laughter mingle with the whispers of wisdom, and the spark of humanity burns bright in the face of the coming night?”
The two figures fell silent, their words hanging heavy in the twilight air. The marketplace hummed on, oblivious to their philosophical dance. But in the quiet space between their thoughts, a seed of possibility was sown, a glimmer of hope that perhaps, even in the face of shadows and screens, the story of humanity was far from over.
The stars began to prick the darkening canvas of the sky, each a tiny eye watching the ancient dance unfold. And in the murmur of the wind, a whisper echoed, a question not just for Socrates and Aristotle, but for all of us: what story will we write with our actions, thoughts and intentions when none concord?
In the poisoned vineyard of the web, nightshade and hemlock intertwine, their bitter fruit cultivated by a dark alliance: demagogues, serpents with forked tongues, weaving fear and falsehood, and aristocrats, spiders of silver and silk, manipulating the strings of information. These power figures, fueled by an insatiable hunger for control, are the origin of a festering inequality, where shadows of misinformation stretch long and menacing.
Children, once innocent buds sprouting in the communal garden, are twisted into warped reflections of the past. Demagogues, like cruel gardeners, graft onto them the bitter fruits of division and hate, while aristocrats, like watchful vultures, prey on their vulnerability. Escape from this suffocating garden becomes a desperate scramble for a centralized haven, a fortress of ritual and symbolic power, built not on shared values, but on the fear of the encroaching darkness.
The sun of communal ritual, once a beacon of unity, casts a dwindling light. Its dawn, a sinful song and story, faded with the rise of individualism, replaced by the harsh neon glare of screens, each a solitary window to a curated universe. Dusk descends, painted in the muted tones of isolation, where third spaces, once bustling havens of connection, lie fallow, echoing with the hollow hum of digital ghosts.
But even in the eclipse of community, there glimmers a stubborn hope. Seeds of resistance, dormant but waiting, stir beneath the poisoned soil. In the quiet defiance of shared laughter, in the whispered acts of kindness, in the flickering flames of shared stories, lies the potential for a new dawn. A dawn where technology, wielded not as a weapon of exclusion, but as a bridge of connection, allows for the reemergence of communal ritual, not as a rigid fortress, but as a vibrant tent, open to all, where diverse voices orchestrate a symphony of shared humanity abilities.
This is the challenge before us: to reclaim the web from the poisoners, to nurture the seeds of connection, and to rediscover the lost art of ritual, not as a tool of control, but as a celebration of our shared existence. This is the path to escape the garden of shadows, to break free from the digital atomization, and to step into the sunlit clearing of a future where community, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes of isolation, its wings strong and vibrant, casting a benevolent shade on the children of tomorrow.
The Athenian sun beat down on the bustling agora, its rays glinting off olives piled high on a stall. Socrates, sandals dusty and brow furrowed, leaned against the fragrant wood, a gadfly amidst the buzzing marketplace. Aristotle, eyes keen and gait confident, strode towards him, a predator seeking intellectual prey.
“Ah, Aristotle!” Socrates’ voice, sharp as Attic salt, sliced through the cacophony. “Come to barter insights, like merchants haggling over your precious olives?”
Aristotle chuckled, a deep rumble that resonated with the city’s heartbeat. “Indeed, Socrates. My thirst for knowledge burns as bright as this midday sun. Today, I seek your scalpel of logic to dissect the enigma of humanity. Tell me, is it true that death’s denial fuels our cultural ascent?”
Socrates’ beard twitched as he considered. “Hmm, a bold claim, my friend! Is it not fear, rather, that drives us to carve rituals from the raw stone of existence? These sacrifices, offerings to appease the unseen, are they not testaments to our primitive dread of oblivion?”
Aristotle’s eyes glinted like polished bronze. “But does not this very struggle against annihilation spark the flame of ingenuity? Look how technics, born from ritual, crafts tools not just for survival, but for creation! In this ‘Ritual World,’ as you call it, does not sacrifice, the conscious giving, pave the path to something grander?”
Socrates’ hand darted out, intercepting a passing fly. “I concede, dear Aristotle, ingenuity dances alongside fear. Yet, even your grand tapestry of cultural transcendence, is it not woven with threads of guilt and the sting of our limitations? Money, that cold symbol of debt and desire, does it not resonate with our primal shame, pushing us towards both heroism and the gnawing need for expiation?”
Aristotle nodded, a wry smile playing on his lips. “True, the clink of coins echoes with both ambition and regret. But is it not through this very tension, this economic pulse, that the Ritual World thrives? Power and expiation, like two sides of the same coin, fuel both the triumphs of heroes and the humbling rituals of forgiveness.”
“So, we paint different facets of the same diamond, Aristotle,” Socrates quipped, a playful glint in his eyes. “You, the grand architect of systems, see culture as a cosmic dance against extinction. I, the gadfly, poke at the underbelly, revealing the raw nerves of guilt and longing that drive us.”
Aristotle’s hand traced the lines on a nearby olive. “Yet, in our contrasting melodies, is there not a harmony? Your dissection lays bare the human condition, while my synthesis offers a broader canvas. Together, do we not illuminate the full spectrum of this curious journey, from dust to aspirations?”
Socrates’ voice, gravelly yet warm, filled the air. “Indeed, friend. In this marketplace of ideas, our voices intertwine, a chorus echoing across the ages. For the struggle for meaning, for transcendence, is woven into the very fabric of our being. And in this shared pursuit, the sting of doubt and the glimmer of hope become the rhythm of our existence.”
The sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched across the marketplace. Socrates and Aristotle, their voices blending, continued their philosophical duet, a dance of logic and wonder marveling at the mystery in the vibrant heart of Athens.
This is the story we must write, not with nightshade and hemlock, but with courage, compassion, and the enduring human spirit. For in the end, it is not walls that define us, but the echoes of shared laughter, the warmth of a helping hand, and the stories that bind us together under the vast, starlit sky.

The heart of Athens’ historic center is experiencing a revival. The 27-acre district is bounded by three of Athens’ most historic squares: Syntagma, Ommonia, and Monistraki. The Commercial Triangle, locally referred to as “Trigono,” is a working district, with commercial activity dating back to the 19th century.
Despite its historic and geographic significance, the neighborhood fell into disrepair in the 1980s. As a result, many buildings were vacated. By 2016, 17% of ground floor and 45% of upper floor spaces were vacant, while a survey of shopkeepers in the area found that 50–70% believed graffiti, lack of cleanliness, and illegal parking were serious issues. While there were pockets of economic activity, the neighborhood was not pedestrian-friendly and it was struggling to attract new investment.
As a city emerging from an eight-year crisis, Athens is making real progress in charting a new future. Under the leadership of Mayor Giorgos Kaminis, the city is employing creative solutions to improve quality of life, and his focus on cultivating community pride and optimism is making a real impact. One of his cornerstone projects has been the revitalization of the Trigono neighborhood.
Since 2015, Bloomberg Associates has worked with Mayor Kaminis to advance his priority projects by sharing expertise from the global network of client cities. Bloomberg Associates is the international, philanthropic consulting arm of Bloomberg Philanthropies, providing select mayors and city governments with custom consultation and mentorship.
This episode features conversations with Alexandros Kambouroglou, the Executive Director of the Athens Partnership, and Elina Dallas, the Project Manager for the Trigono program. Jake Elder of Bloomberg Associates Sustainability Team joined them in Athens.

Athens is often hailed as the birthplace of democracy. But Athens was also the birthplace of gay culture. Openly practiced and celebrated, homosexuality was part of the social fabric of ancient Athens. Today, the Greek capital remains a very gay-friendly city, with countless gay and lesbian bars, many openly gay celebrities, and a vibrant LGBTQI+ community. Athens Pride, the country’s biggest festival of diversity, is held every June.
Just like in every vibrant European city, Athens can be a handful for a first-time visitor. Here’s all the LGBTQI+ legalities you’ll need to know and all the organizations you’ll may have to contact, while in Athens.
Legal Status on discrimination
In Greece there are laws prohibiting discrimination based on sex, race, age, or sexual orientation; civil unions are legal, but not full-fledged same-sex marriages; a status many government officials say will soon change. The Mayor of Athens has openly supported same-sex marriages and many couples wait for it.
Homophobia
There has been a growing concern over homophobia, due to the rise of the far right in Greece because of the crisis. Although that was true, homophobic incidents are rare. The biggest opposition to lgbtqi+ issues is held by a few priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, who are by and large regarded as “relics” by most Greeks, who see the world change for the better. There have been fewer attacks on gay couples in the last 5 years, than there are fingers in one’s hand. Athenians don’t tolerate intolerance.
LGBTQI+ Organizations
There are many organizations for the LGBTQI+s of Greece and the vast majority of them is headquartered in Athens. OLKE is the most prominent one, pushing out the non-discriminatory agenda. For the young crowd, Colour Youth is a fresh and very active organization (famous for its parties) that acts more as a community of young lgbtqi+ people who want to have fun and claim their rights, than an old school non-profit organization. Positive Voice welcomes HIV positive people, and friends, who wish to stand for their community and help in any way they can towards a zero infections day. Athens CheckPoint is an NGO that offers quick and reliable HIV blood checks for free. It’s located near Monastiraki Square (Metro Line 1&3) and have very discreet staff.
Gay Publications
The oldest and most read LGBTQI+ publication in Athens is Antivirus Magazine, a Greek speaking, bi-monthly free press, that for over a decade chronicles the news and events of the gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer and intersex community of Athens and Greece. You’ll find it at bars, universities, hot-dog joints and many other places that support the equal-rights movement. One step further, Colourful Planet is a bookshop-cafe that has also turned into a publishing house. Young (or just new) LGBTQI+ writers are welcome here, to find a publishing outlet for their voice to be heard.
The Greek Capital is always ready for big colourful parades and out festivals! For over a decade Athens hosts one of the most dynamically growing Prides in Europe every June and the last couple of years, the Outview Festival of Athens draws international attention with its screenings and guests!
Athens Pride
The City of Athens wears its rainbow colours with pride every year, on the second Saturday of June, at Syntagma (it used to be held in Klafthmonos Square, but now it moved to the city’s main square). With countless events and parties leading up to the big parade, Athens Pride has developed to one of the most formidable in Europe. It’s sponsored by the City of Athens and it’s a custom for the parade to start on the Athens Mayor’s mark! It was in 2004 that the first Gay Pride was held and since then, more and more people and corporations support it and attend to its events. Nowadays it’s lauded as one of the most dynamically growing prides in the western world.
Outview Festival
Athens annual Queer Film Festival, although relatively new, has gained extreme momentum and is already included in the most important LGBTQI+ events and Cinema Festivals of the Country. Every year, for a week in May, a downtown cinema theatre (usually the state-owned Greek Film Archive’s cinema) hosts an international festival celebrating movies from all over the world, made by LGBTQI+ creators or with a strong LGBTQI+ theme. Directors, actors, screenwriters and more attend the festival, that also organizes forums and workshops for those who wish to learn more about queer cinema.
Athens is notorious for its nightlife! Expect even more eleganza extravaganza at the city’s many LGBTQI+ clubs and pubs! And not just for the Dancing Queens! LGBTQI+ travellers will feel welcome to any cafe and bar of Athens, as the young and hip crowd is always friendly and up for a talk. For those who love to show their dancing skills, the Athenian soundtrack is a loud playlist for every taste! Disco divas, pop guilty pleasures, progressive electronica, Greek popular music? You name it! There is more than meets the eye in those small gay and lesbian bars.
Keramikos
Usually referred to as “Gazi”, the Keramikos area, at the Keramikos Metro Line 3 station, plays host to the most famous gay clubs in Greece. Some have over a decade of constant operation and are still as popular as ever! Open seven nights a week, the party never stops here, for every lgbtqi+ night owl. Bears, next door guys and gals, fashion forward people, trendy celebrities are among the ones joining in the fun at Gazi. Out for a cocktail, a beer or just a glass of wine, whatever someone looks for, will find it here, including many hot Greeks! The square at the centre of Gazi area also has many cafes, burger joints, vromiko sandwich places and even a pasta to go, cause gay or straight, at the end of a long night out, you’ll want something to sink your teeth into.
Historical Centre
If you wish to start the night earlier, you could visit the Agias Eirinis square; it’s full of the hip “in crowd” having coffee, a snack or their first drinks, at the many beautiful cafe/bars around. A relatively recent Athenian highlight, the square is now considered the downtown meeting point and place to be for all aspiring fashionistas. One can sit at its numerous gay-friendly places and read a book, consult a map, or simply watch the passerby's. In the paved streets from Monastiraki to Syntagma, you’ll find the rainbow heart of Athens beating, until the sun comes up in the morning.
Victoria Square
Not hip, nor cool, the area around Victoria station (Metro Line 1) was once the go-to-place for gays, when there was no concept of equal rights movement, and many people were still in the closet. The many hidden bars gained fame back then, but also a devoted following, so it’s no surprise that some have remained, although they’re now more of “boy bars”. Many immigrants flock to these places, since most live in the area of Victoria, giving these gay bars a quite different and unique oriental attitude.
Koukles
Koukles deserves a chapter on its own. Founded in 1994, the club originally aimed at helping Drag Queens find a place to express themselves. But as we all know if you put many Drag Queens together the results are either Disastrous or Fabulous! At Koukles, fabulousness is mandatory! While many clubs offer Drag Shows (like BeQueer ), in Koukles they're on every night! Fierce and Fun take central stage as International Divas fight for the spotlight and our applause. Word of wisdom: Make reservations if you want to get a table!
How can one not fall in love with Athens? The Acropolis, the Nightlife, the Food, the Sun, the Sea. Would you think that only in Mykonos you’d find gay beaches in Greece? Think again! Athens will make you want to “Shante -Stay!” all year round! Pack your sexiest swimwear, cause in Athens, you’re going to need it! Being a stone-throw away from the sea, the city serves as the perfect place to combine sightseeing and summer fun!
Limanakia
Just like there is no such thing as a gay island, but then, there’s Mykonos, there is no such thing as a gay beach, but then there’s Limanakia. Easily accessible by bus or car, right before the coastal suburb of Varkiza, Limanakia is a rocky beach that started off as a nudist beach but evolved into a semi-nude gay beach. Take a dive at the cool deep blue waters and be careful when you walk of the rock, as it gets slippery. Here you’ll find many singles trying to hook-up and couples wanting to get intimate, or simply looking for a tan without swimsuit markings. The atmosphere gets very flirty during sunset when the sun dives in the Saronic waters.
Mavro Lithari
Following the road to Sounio, a few kilometers before the Temple of Poseidon, you’ll find not one, but three small gulfs that welcome gays! Right at the 48 km of the road you’ll come across three small gulfs that are the hotspot of hip people! A lovely mix of Athenians wishing to relax and enjoy a beer under the sun, without over-thinking or feeling ashamed to go skinny dipping, usually sunbathes here; there’s also a canteen to one of the rocky gulfs, which serves coffees and snacks to-go, an always important aspect to anything Greek.
Kakia Skala
Before millions of people lived in Athens, when its suburbs were nothing more than small villages, western Attika used to go to Kineta for a quick swim. White pebbled beaches and calm waters made a perfect getaway during a sweltering day. But then the sudden overpopulation of Athens altered everything, industrializing a big part of Attika, with a huge effect on sea pollution. Since then, many years have passed and the beaches from Kakia Skala all the way to Kineta welcome again Athenians during sizzling summer days. Somewhere well hidden, under the National Highway that passes through, lies a small rocky beach with pebbles that is for nudists and gays.
Today the Greek capital is a very gay-friendly destination, hosting the biggest Pride Parade in the country and offering numerous queer activities! However, the Athenian history offers an abundance of queer cultural moments. Homosexuality was openly practiced, often with official sanction, until Christianity took over. Plus: Plato’s famous Symposium takes place in the house of Agathon, a gay Athenian tragic poet who was the lifelong companion of Pausanias, when he receives a prize for his first tragedy.

At the entrance to the Acropolis, there is a plaque that commemorates Athens’ contributions to Western civilisation. The city has had an outsized impact in shaping the trajectory of modern democracy, philosophy, architecture, and drama, and I was excited to explore the place at the centre of it all: the Acropolis.
My day started at 9am after a quick breakfast of cold cuts and fresh fruit at the hostel. I had opted for a guided tour of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Acropolis Museum, and I met my guide and our small group at the Acropolis metro station. Though I did spot a number of Indians on my flight to Athens yesterday, my group were all Americans and Canadians, with I being the sole representative from the eastern hemisphere.
Our guide had warned us that its best that we stay together and start the tour early, as three cruise ships had docked at Piraeus the previous day, and they would all descend on the Acropolis today, leading it to be an extremely crowded day to explore. By the time we reached the Acropolis, the crowds had started to thicken, with it being almost impossible to not be accosted by the sea of humanity at every turn.
The term Acropolis is from the Greek words akron, meaning highest point, and polis, meaning city. Though the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, it was Pericles who coordinated the construction of the buildings that the area is famous for today: the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Over the years, countless wars and unthinkable acts of destruction, coupled with quests for religious and political hegemony have seriously damaged these magnificent structures, yet they still stand majestically over the city of Athens to tell their tale.
The Acropolis, though in reality (that honour goes to Lycabettus Hill, which I visited later) not the highest point of the city, rises 150m above the sea level, offering its occupants a commanding view of the city and its surroundings. On a clear day, one can see all the way to the port of Piraeus, enabling the rulers to have enough time to scramble resources in the case of an invasion. The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta was primarily a battle for maritime control, as the victor of the war was guaranteed control over crucial maritime routes across the Mediterranean Sea. As my flight was descending onto the tarmac of Athens’ airport yesterday, I did notice the lack of vegetation across the terrain — the hills are pockmarked with shrub vegetation and the occasional olive tree, a contrast from the lush green vegetation that I’m used to back home in Kerala. Athens’ maritime prowess was thus a result of sheer necessity — the poor soil of the Attica region meant that the city’s only route to power and wealth was overseas trade, making a significant maritime presence key to their domination.
Our first stop on the tour was the Theatre of Dionysus, built between the fourth and the fifth century BC. Walking amidst its ruins, I was reminded of the contribution of the Greek tragedians: Sophocles, Euripedes, and Aesychlus, all of whom staged plays at this very theatre. There is also significant evidence to show that Aristophanes, the Father of Comedy, staged his play The Clouds at the very same venue, which eventually led to the trial and the subsequent condemning to death of Socrates. Artistic expression has always played an important role in maintaining the balance of power in society, and we will always have the great Greek playwrights to thank for their contributions.
A narrow path carved onto the slopes of the hill is the only way up and down the Acropolis, and as time passed by, the entire route became crowded with tourists. In most cities in Europe, over-tourism has become an increasing concern, with Athens being no exception. Our group slowly made way to the top, with the magnificent edifice of the Parthenon slowly coming into view. A former temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is the definitive epitome of Greek architecture, an enduring symbol of democracy and Western civilisation.
Tired from climbing the modest hill in the Athenian summer, we gathered under the shade of an olive tree for some respite, when my eye caught sight of a plaque detailing the foundation myth of the city of Athens. According to Greek mythology, both Poseidon and Athena wanted to be the patron deity of the city, and with Zeus being unable to resolve the conflict, the competing Gods decided to have a contest and leave it to the citizens of the city to decide which gift was better than the other. Poseidon struck his spear to the ground and a spring sprang up, and Athena gave birth from the ground to a magnificent olive tree. The water from the spring was salty and not very useful, on the other hand, the olive tree provided the citizens with food, shade, oil, and wood, and the city was named after Athena, who then became the protector of this city, which would grow to become the most powerful city in all of Greece.
The Parthenon is a stunning example of Greek architecture, with architectural flourishes adorning all of its surfaces. Only a few of the frieze, mentopes, and pediments, which topped its magnificent Doric columns, now stand, with a few of them now in the Acropolis Museum, and the remaining, unsurprisingly, now housed in the British Museum in London, carefully smuggled out of then Ottoman Greece, by British nobleman and diplomat Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin. The Elgin Marbles, as they are now called, are the Greek kohinoor, and the Greek have also been lobbying the hallways of Whitehall for its repatriation.
We then made our way back down to head to the last stop for the day: the Acropolis Museum. A magnificent structure of glass and steel, the museum houses remnants excavated from the neighbourhood surrounding the Acropolis. Consisting of three levels, the museum is a captivating blend of ancient and modern. The ground level showcases an impressive collection of ancient statues, excavated from the numerous sanctuaries that dotted the area. However, the star of the museum is undoubtedly the Parthenon Gallery, a breathtaking glass atrium constructed in the same dimensions as the Parthenon itself. The gallery holds the famous Parthenon frieze, the metopes, and the pediments, all arranged to mirror their original positions on the Parthenon. During earlier requests to the British for the return of the Elgin Marbles, the British Government made the claim that the Greeks had “no suitable location where they could be displayed”, and the creation of the Acropolis Museum aims to remedy this shortcoming in the Greek request for reattribution.
Our tour ended at 2pm and I felt drawn to explore more of the city’s historic charm. I began by strolling through Makrigianni’s streets and towards Plaka. As I walked the quiet streets of Plaka, the calmness of Athens became evident as birdsong filled the air, a rare sound in a bustling city. After a quick lunch of a gyro, I headed to the Athens National Garden, a green space in the heart of the city. Nestled between the park and the magnificent Hadrian’s Temple of Olympian Zeus is the Zappeion, a palatial building built for the Olympic Games. Named after Evangelos Zappas, one of the pioneers of the modern Olympic Games, it is now used for meetings and ceremonies and holds a place in history as the site where Greece’s ascension to the Eurozone was signed in May 1979.
As I wrapped up my explorations for the day, I found myself ruminating over the city’s striking blend of the old and the new, a harmonious co-existence of historical legacy and contemporary vibrance. Athens is a city that has continued to evolve without losing sight of its illustrious past, and as I continue my journey deeper into this gorgeous city, I’m reminded that every step taken in Athens is a step through time, an experience that only few other cities in the world can provide.

“If Athens shall appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.” — Pericles
During our recent family holiday in Greece in May 2023, we had the incredible opportunity to explore the ancient sites of Athens.
While the Acropolis and the iconic Parthenon were undoubtedly awe-inspiring, it was our visit to the Ancient Agora that truly transported us back in time. It provided us with a genuine glimpse into ancient Athenian life.
“The Ancient Agora of Athens is an archaeological site located beneath the northwest slope of the Acropolis. The word “agora” applies to an assembly of people and by extend marks the gathering place. In modern Greek the term means “marketplace”.”
The Ancient Agora of Athens is situated between Monastiraki and the Acropolis. The Agora is a captivating site that captures the essence of ancient Athens. As we strolled through the…

What if Socrates’ death sentence was justified? I’m sure you’re rolling your eyes. After all, he’s likely the greatest philosopher that ever lived and a method of teaching —named the Socratic Method out of reverence—bears his name.
Reverence is a good word to describe the current treatment for the man who possibly lived in 400 BC. Author Donald Robertson points out the presently popular Stoics used Socrates’ ideas as a building block. In fact, words written about him started Zeno of Citium down his path. Plus, Epictetus spoke admiringly about him as well.
The Oracle of Delphi even confirmed no one was wiser than Socrates. So, what could justify his punishment?
The philosopher’s curated story states he annoyed the Athenian establishment with his Socratic Method. In other words, he asked too many questions. Just think about your five-year-old nephew continuously asking “why” as you try to answer. Now, manifest that into a grown man’s frame.
Speaking of children, Socrates’ accusers also charged him with corrupting the youth of Athens. By “corrupting” most proclaim this means questioning their elders.

Many are troubled or have difficulty understanding the meanings of CLR James’s meditations on Classical Athens and his study of American civilization. Far more important than whether antiquity and modern societies consistently embody profound philosophical values is what are our own democratic aspirations. This is the riddle at the intersection of James Athenian meditation within his book American Civilization.
Can Classical Athens be a measure for appraising America? Can the world of Aristotle, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Cleon, and Pericles illuminate the ethnically and culturally plural United States? How does nuclear power compare with a few thousand Greeks battling in the Peloponnesian Wars, or at Marathon, Platea, and Salamis in the Greco-Persian Wars? As the 1950s began, C.L.R. James, a Caribbean radical scholar, thought this comparative thinking central for clarifying freedom and popular self-government. Perhaps sublimated within the American constitutional struggle for happiness was the class struggle.
Between the Struggle for Happiness and the Class Struggle
CLR James (1901-1989) wrote on diverse topics: Haiti, Russia, France, Ghana, and Hungary. He also purposefully considered Shakespeare, Herman Melville, the Hegelian dialectic, Caribbean women of the barrack yard, and the sport of cricket. Placing Classical Athens in conversation with mid-twentieth century America, this experimental meditation challenges us. Can we think beyond boundaries? This is what James’s book American Civilization (1950) poses to the reader.
James was detained as an undesirable immigrant and a political prisoner at Ellis Island in 1952. His defense strategy, though he never found a fit public platform for it like Paul Robeson, was to explain the dilemmas of American democracy and civilization to the public and overcome official authorities.
Why Compare Athens and America?
James compared tropes of ancient Athens and modern America. He discussed questions of popular self-emancipation that are subordinated by rigid historical materialist views. Whether poor, powerless, alienated, or aware of a conquering force, most observers have a false idea of toiling people's creative potential. This is a result that dialogues about culture, civilization, and democracy generally, assume commoners have no part. Perhaps, their lives are permitted as cultural decoration for society.
A Trinidadian activist and illegal immigrant to the U.S., James believed these ancient and modern societies were valuable comparative referents to unpack this dilemma of freedom. This was so, even though the classical Athenian city-state was probably no larger than the size of the population of 1950s Vermont, one of America's smallest states. And the ancients' economy was probably no bigger than one modern department store.
Who compares a continent-wide modern country to an archipelago of islands in antiquity? Of course, a Caribbean man who admires Ancient Greece. But he was not juxtaposing a small place with an imperial center. James was evaluating world civilizations and clarifying the search for popular struggles within them.
Every Cook Can Govern and the Meaning of American Civilization
We must remember that James’s Every Cook Can Govern (1956) argued that the classical Athenian city-state was a direct democracy. That this could inform rebellious modern politics against elite representative governments, whether maintained by capitalists, communists, or trade union hierarchy. However, in American Civilization, the Athenian meaning was more obscure.
A hint is James’s Greece tells us something about the relations between working people, intellectuals, and artists. Further, it placed the ancient theatrical dramas of Aeschylus and Aristophanes in conversation with the modern popular culture of American films, comic strips, sports, and television. More than what academic literary critics thought, James’s mind was on what the audience or spectators did in response to popular cultural productions in antiquity. Further, what could they accomplish in the present and future?
First, we must understand that at least since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. has been in a permanent culture war around social identities. The perennial dispute is Anglo-America, that some wish to “make great again,” versus ethnically plural multi-cultural America. American conservatives claim that Greco-Roman heritage is foundational to Western civilization. On this basis, some say America is a civilization. They wish to place the U.S., after World War II, as taking over leadership of the world from Europe. This cultural approach arguably last had free reign in the early 1950s as James was writing shortly before the emergence of the Third World national liberation epoch.
Cultural Wars Around Social Identities
Today the U.S. is seen by most progressive scholars of American Studies as not a civilization but as a harvest of empire. A plurality of many ethnicities and cultures have gathered; American Exceptionalism is not the best means to account for this. Though the idea that progressives are against the empire of capital is most often a cruel joke. This is not irrelevant to understanding James’s American Civilization. For he points out correctly that modern business management theorists during World War II understood, far better than the Moscow-oriented communists, that workers wished to directly govern their industrial workplaces. And the historical evidence of the practices of both, two different hostile visions to popular self-government, prove James’s view accurate. This explains much about contemporary not merely early 1950s America. Still, this issue is what the link to the Ancient Greeks is all about; discovering the sublimation of everyday people’s potential.
James’s Athenian thought experiments for America go beyond the culture wars which is really a misnomer. The question is how will humans live on this planet; this is what the low-intensity, sometimes open conflicts have been about. What values will humans live by? It does not require ancient Greece or modern America to historically maintain a consistent set of values for this meditation to be useful. In fact, creative conflicts in societies can reveal not just chaos through possessive individualism but common futures. Observation of Hegelian contradictions is not about permanent sins or hypocrisy. Rather, the nuclei of the new society and their struggle to be born.
Beyond Culture Wars: American Civilization and Ancient Greeks
James’s American Civilization (1950), posthumously published in 1993, embodied this transition between the old world of looking at things and the new. But not fully as we might expect a famous Pan-African anti-colonial and independent socialist to do so.
James carried on the tradition of the French intellectual Tocqueville, and many other European thinkers who visited the U.S. from abroad. He was perhaps among the last to do his own comparative reflection on how America sustained, or not, the older foundations of Europe, which many assumed were philosophically Greek.
Placing the Athenian Legacy in Support of Popular Struggles
Most Americans, even university professors, cannot process intellectual thought that doesn't adhere to the patterns of the two main American electoral parties that overlord society together. James, counter-intuitively for many, was placing the Athenian legacy on the side of the workers, women, and Black freedom movements. After all, he was writing about civilization.
American civilization needed a coherent political and cultural philosophy. He was aware classical Athens subordinated women, slaves, and immigrants. James was trying to improve on the direct democratic sensibility for modern politics.
Civilization and National Cultures?
Contrary to Andrew Ross’s view, James was not writing about civilization or the prospects of socialism in one country. Instead, he was asking what was behind the cultural front built around Franklin Roosevelt produced by state planners, progressive intellectuals, and trade union hierarchy.
James was writing about a perceived civilization or national culture and incorporating dynamic tensions. It doesn’t matter whether we or James see America as a unified national culture or not. American concerns with disunity reveal this is how the vast majority see things, even where they dispute the American character and purpose.
The struggles for an ambiguous workers' democracy, and Black and women's liberation, he reconciled with the ideals of Greek antiquity that normally was wielded by modern Western elites. James did not strongly emphasize, in this publication, America as foundationally an empire based on African slavery and conquering the Indigenous, and for good reason.
Discarding Historical Trauma for a Renewal of Political Philosophy
The reception of James’s American Civilization is fumbled where it does not center James as an aspiring cultivator of the popular will. Moreover, where it does not illustrate that he is trying to clarify the political philosophy of ordinary Americans.
James was writing for a popular audience, who in the aftermath of World War II, did not easily grasp anti-imperialism. We must remember in real life he agitated against World War II as a clash of racists, imperialists, and authoritarians on both sides. This was something the Moscow-oriented communists did not do. For, like Stalinist Russia, they became allies of Franklin Roosevelt.
Before the Montgomery Bus Boycott: Thinking Beyond Equal Opportunity
This manuscript was an exercise in creative self-expression and not merely disciplined to a radical political movement. More significantly, those who pursue the death of the American nation culturally and intellectually (but not really, it's just an academic trope) fail to posit what should be America's political philosophical basis.
While in the early 1950s, the modern civil rights movement as embodied by the Montgomery Bus Boycott had not yet begun, we must remember something crucial. Equal opportunity to enter the rules of hierarchy has no democratic basis (direct majority rule) and has only renewed the American empire. It can only have a democratic basis for those who wish to diversify the hierarchies of a republic, which by definition doesn’t believe everyday people can govern.
This perennial failure, but intentional act for those who sell past traumas for present decadent collaborations, was far from what James was pursuing. The colonized man from the British empire sojourning within the American empire was trying something different. American Civilization was trying to discover popular self-management beyond voters for electoral politics, aware the vote had not yet been guaranteed to all.
Gathering Fragments Like an Archaeologist
James’s American Civilization is like many ancient Greek texts. Their discovery and publication, as archaeologists and historians comprehend, is a retrieval project of incomplete fragments that only partially indicate the world of their authors. James’s final draft may have clarified and foreshadowed the nature of the American empire. Similar to his Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways (1952), he might have shown the solution was the motley crew, the global toilers of Herman Melville’s whaling vessel, cooperating and aspiring to save the social ecology under arduous circumstances. The preface to James’s Melville book reminded this was one part of a larger study of the U.S.
However, American Civilization articulates a scenario, seemingly outdated from the moment it was written. What if John L. Lewis, the famous trade union leader of the mineworkers, became the next president after Harry Truman? This was an irritating projection for those who knew James was an advocate of workers' self-management, and Lewis was part of repressing such social instincts during the Age of the CIO labor movement (1933-1955). Still, many miss the ancient Greek content of James’s thought experiment.
Learning from Aristophanes's Sausage-Seller
James argued that if American intellectuals in the early 1950s could understand artistic creation, like Aristophanes in his play The Knights, ordinary people could be encouraged to subvert populist authoritarian leaders, such as Cleon in the era of the Peloponnesian War. The ""sausage-seller"" appears to do this in The Knights; James’s American Civilization uncharacteristically refers not simply to workers, farmers, and cooks but to sausage-sellers, a plebian identity from ancient Greece. Though many Americans eat hot dogs and sausages, ordinary toilers have a difficult time revolting against bureaucracy within their own freedom movements.
James proposed, not an affirmation of the authoritarian trade union leader or progressive politician; rather, an impending confrontation with them by the ""sausage-sellers."" That Lewis was a Republican, who both sided and clashed with Franklin Roosevelt, and who was a major trade union leader, complicates things nicely. If James’s readers were actually going to think for themselves. Many formally educated have had difficulty since the book was published posthumously. Why write about Greek antiquity or workers at all?
James explained that observers of American civilization, unlike European history (ancient and modern), do not understand that behind great personalities above society (in politics, sports, and entertainment) are the aspirations, the repressed strivings of social classes and groups. While James believed every ordinary toiler could govern society, there was a counter-vailing idea. Those individual personalities who express heroism and creative genius do not mirror the abilities of commoners. But this is a result that society is not arranged properly for everyday people to arrive on their own authority. Many like to live vicariously through great personalities above society. James, the cultivator of the popular will, was trying to draw them out of their shell below society.
The Social Motion Below the Great Personalities Above Society
James felt the classical city-state was approximating or approaching this possibility in a more primitive way before the emergence of modern politics. We must remember the totality of ancient Greece is invented by archaeologists. Classical Athens functioned substantially toward a future without a past.
Behind the statesmen (Cleisthenes, Solon, Cleon, and Pericles) were the emerging “proletarians of Piraeus.” Observing and judging the artistic productions of Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, was an audience of rank-and-file citizens. Importantly, not professional experts.
James underscored it was the popular audiences of theatrical productions that thousands of years later were manufactured as “high culture” by American and Western elites that decided what plays were the greatest. And so, the ordinary people of Athens had the capacity for independent judgment. And given the content of the award-winning plays, they clearly had the ability to make political judgments. Therefore, James is saying to his American audience that popular culture is high culture. And the latter is a fabrication unless it centers the judgment and capacities of everyday people. Western and American elites would be surprised to hear this.
Aeschylus’s Oresteia, Dick Tracy, and the Mafia in 1950s America
In the early 1950s U.S., people delighted in Dick Tracy comic strips and films depicting the Mafia. For James, these had something in common. Ordinary Americans were not satisfied with hierarchical government; they wished to live outside the state and its law. Though, of course, these were impositions. Tracy, a private detective, surprisingly had something in common with gangsters. They had guns, took matters into their own hands, and were not police.
American toilers wanted to be their own law-givers. While Plato searched for personalities to discipline the grassroots of the city-state, he felt it was a must, where Athenian commoners, even slaves, walked the streets like they were audacious peers of elitist citizens. It is debatable whether this is structurally true of ancient Athens. Rather, this was James’s Plato observing and fearing, through the trope of Socrates, the popular self-emancipating potential. This is our audacious Caribbean radical scholar's concern.
Vendettas, Patriarchy and Popular Courts
James loved Aeschylus’s Oresteia Trilogy. The meaning of its series of vendettas is disputed. Does it justify patriarchy or suggest a rebellion against it? Does it point to popular courts as the meaning of justice or the state as an argument for containing the Furies? Nevertheless, the audience decided these plays were award-winning. More crucially, as citizens, the audience had to decide, after the play the meaning of popular justice and their role in carrying it out.
James explained you can only relate to this if you have the sensibility of the ancient Greeks. Ordinary people’s actual social status in ancient Athens, or in modern America, was not decisive. Paramount was, how in culture and politics, commoners found means to think beyond their leaders and act on their own authority. What was revealed in Greek culture, sublimated in plays by Aeschylus or Aristophanes and their audiences, could also be seen in American popular culture. This told James something about mass audiences. Despite their surface psychology, they possess explosive potential.
The Odes of Pindar, Bureaucratic Politicians, and Business
James points to the poetry of Pindar implying it tells us about the commoners of ancient Greece and the U.S. What could he mean? He means a society that celebrates sports and competition, whether in the Olympic games or in modern baseball and football stadiums, where writing odes to the winners, confesses the true character of their nations. This cannot be embodied by politicians and businessmen. The barefoot and poor, with state sponsorship, little league uniforms, or playing in the street, express creative capacities in games that society is not organized for them to do so in politics. This can suggest a decline and fall for America or an emerging new beginning.
The comparative conversation about Athens and America does not move in straight and predictable patterns, especially for those who think like a voter for elite representative government. But even if the reader is starting to enjoy this meditation, how do we account for James’s celebration of Phidias and Praxiteles? What do ancient sculptors and architects say about the American proletariat? Further, James often did not make clear what the Peloponnesian War and Greco-Persian wars said about the potential of commoners in Greece and America.
What Can Be Accomplished in a Time of War?
Many scholars recognize that the Peloponnesian War (the battle between Athens and Sparta, which Sparta won) revealed an imperial tendency in Athens just as much as it embodies the search for federation. It is debatable what the meaning of the earlier Greco-Persian wars should mean for America. However, America, following World War II, was coming out of the experience of both foreign wars, and race, gender, and class struggles within.  James is saying great art and great heroism cannot fulfill themselves during war; society can only support them when it has put war behind them. Still, ordinary people’s instincts toward popular democracy, initially suppressed, can emerge in times of war as well. Even, if the rulers above society don’t wish this to happen. For James, the Athenian direct democracy presided over by Pericles between these ancient wars, was a new beginning where all citizens took part in popular councils and assemblies. There were no specialists and experts that dominated James’s Athens. Contrarily, this had been the vision of Franklin Roosevelt's planners and cultural apparatus.   The average Athenian citizen made decisions on economic planning, judicial affairs, and foreign relations, all matters the community faced. The Athenians knew everything was political, and art, science, and philosophy were integrated with politics and government, not in a dogmatic ideological way. But in the sense that, Greek citizens made the decisions directly that governed their lives. James was searching for a future America with these ideals and principles; certainly, the American conservative only pretended to do this for white men alone.
James did not believe Aristotle's politics should guide 1950s America. Though one should read him to understand politics and philosophy. Aristotle's Poetics interested James where the latter clarified what Athenian drama had been about when society was not menaced by war. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes were about purging their audiences of pity and terror. Where the masses had pity for heroes, and felt society was stalked by doom, they might emerge to take matters into their own hands after witnessing such theatre.  However, to relate to this proposition, we must reject tragedy as fate or some catastrophe beyond our control. When an actual play comes to an end, what is at issue for James’s Aristotle, is what will the audience do afterward. James’s American Civilization felt progressive cultural critics in the U.S. instead attached themselves to hierarchical regimes instead of the unfolding impulses to popular self-management.
American Labor: Wartime Strikes, Wildcat Strikes
We must remember that during World War II, most trade union leaders signed contracts with the bosses for a no-strike pledge for patriotic sustaining of war production. As Martin Glaberman has documented, then the rank-and-file, through their wildcat strikes, took greater initiatives than they had, even during the early CIO labor movement. We must remember that the first March on Washington Movement that strived to forge African American civil rights, despite its zig-zags, was a wartime strike.
Ordinary Americans’ apparent consciousness and psychology yesterday were no indication of their independent insurgent action tomorrow. James made clear in American Civilization that if workers followed John L. Lewis or Walter Reuther, the auto workers’ leader today, this was not an indication of what may happen tomorrow. Where leaders follow the instincts of everyday people below society (or not), it does not mean commoners cannot rupture with them.
What Do America’s Wartime Strikes Have to Do With Ancient Greece?
What do American wartime strikes have to do with Ancient Greece? The Greeks who took part in the Peloponnesian War and the Persian Wars had their own racial, imperial, and patriarchal impulses. They lived through times of crisis where they did not know exactly what they wanted. It is these same people, who forged the first aspiring direct democracy. Separate from ideals associated with ancient Athens is a reality: imperfect people with blind spots were the foundation of an impressive civilization. This is so cross-culturally, when considering any world civilization, the search for profound autonomy must be drawn out of barbaric circumstances.  James’s American Civilization aspired to show that the purported genius of American organization was not a penchant for national production or industriousness. Rather, the main currents of American character are the capacities for popular self-government among ordinary people. Intellectuals who cannot see this, James says, commit treason. Our capacity to grasp this has something to do with how we understand Classical Athens.
Re-Reading Classical Athens Beyond the Affirmative Action Empire
A proper understanding of James’s Greek antiquity studies is still emerging. And aspects of how he grasped the United States are still obscure. Can ancient Athens, or its spirit and ideals, be a model for America as a civilization, or a comparative reference for our understanding of American freedom and popular self-government? Do we inherently clash with contemporary dispositions in such pursuit? Where it forces us to move beyond making America “great again,” but also the affirmative action empire and the ethnically plural police state, James’s legacies deserve reconsideration.

The history of Athens is closely tied to the history of Greek democracy. It was in Athens that this form of political regime, which contributed to the city’s greatness and spread throughout the Greek world, developed. However, the early history of Athens remains obscure. It is known that there was a palace at the future city’s location during the Mycenaean period, surviving the destruction at the end of the second millennium. This allowed Athens to be a refuge for Greeks who settled in Ionia in the early 11th century. Little is known about the city’s history before the late 7th century. Aristotle, in the first part of the Constitution of Athens, reports that the original royal power was divided among three archons, later joined by six thesmothetes. Initially appointed for life, then elected for ten years, and finally annually, these archons governed with the assistance of a council of elders on the hill of Ares, known as the Areopagus. Two events marked the late 7th century: Cylon’s attempt to establish tyranny, thwarted by archon Megacles of the Alcmaeonid family, and Draco’s creation of a legal code regulating punishment for crimes of bloodshed. Aristotle also attributes a constitution to Draco, which modern critics consider a forgery from the late 5th century by those opposed to democracy.
With the beginning of the 6th century, and despite the numerous obscurities that remain, the…

I just arrived in Athens. My cab driver’s name was Christos.
His father was from Greek Macedonia, his mother from Crete. Men in Crete wear all black as a symbol of respect, he told me, “for the men who fought and lost their lives in the many wars, ‘fighting for our freedoms.’”
“Greece has so much history for such a little country.” “Look at you, you have such a big country and so little history.” (Ahem… I had been reading Thomas Jefferson’s biography on the plane.)
Christos had a construction company with over 25 employees before the Economic Crisis. As work started to dry up, he continued to pay his workers and had to lay them off gradually as the money ran out. He still has a company “on paper” but there has been no work for years. The company was started by his father who, he said, cries because he thought he had given his son a livelihood and now there is nothing.
I asked if he was against Greece being in the European Union. “No, I am not against Europe, I just want Europe to care about Greeks. Not Greece. Greeks.”
Cristos has three children so, he said, what was he to do? He spent money buying a taxi license. Two years ago, it cost him 100,000 euros (from 250,000 before the crisis.) Now the price has dropped again to 50,000 but Christos can’t recover the money he has already paid. He says that there is no work and even if there were, no one would hire him because he has several diplomas — he is too qualified.
He was rushing to finish up and get home before tonight’s World Cup soccer match started. Brazil-Colombia. I asked who he was for. “Brazil, of course.”
“You know they have the most expensive player in the world: Neymar?” (I did know.) “One hundred million euros. That is what they paid for a futbol player,” Christos said. “We — this humanity — we have to change. We have to change because we have children.”
As he pulled into the hotel, he apologized, “So much history. Such a much bigger conversation.”
But, sometimes the only way to start big conversations is with small ones — like a short chat with a stranger.

“The Parthenon Marbles are part of the Parthenon Temple, the most important work of ancient Greek architecture, considered the highest sculpture and artwork of its time. Of course, its importance doesn’t end there; what happened afterwards contributes to its story” said Zeynep Boz from the eastern side, bringing joy to the western coast of the Aegean.
Boz, a prehistoric archaeology graduate with art, law, and ethics degrees, represents Turkey as the Head of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. She previously served as a contact person for UNESCO with the UN Security Council. When she declared that there was no evidence supporting the claim that the Parthenon Marbles were taken to England legitimately during the Ottoman Empire, she became the person of the week in Greece, making Athens happy. But what is the story of the Parthenon Sculptures, which pit Greece against England? What does Turkey’s cultural support for Athens mean?
The bust of Nefertiti, extracted by German archaeologists from Egypt and brought to the Neues Museum in Berlin; the Rosetta Stone, discovered by a French soldier during a fortification excavation in Egypt and sent to the British Museum; the statue of Emperor Lucius Verus, returned to Turkey after being smuggled abroad in 1972… History, discovery, and plunder… All have been intertwined for centuries. The fate of the marble sculptures friezes, and architectural pieces taken from the Parthenon Temple in the Athenian Acropolis was no different.
Dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, these sculptures went from Athens, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to England in the early 19th century. It was claimed that the artefacts were taken with permission, thanks to a decree obtained by British diplomat Lord Elgin from the Ottomans. Support for returning this significant historical treasure, which has often caused diplomatic tension between Athens and London, came from Turkey on the other side of the Aegean. Zeynep Boz, the Turk who made Athens happy, answered questions.
Your speech about the Parthenon Sculptures at last month’s UNESCO meeting attracted attention. Is Turkey’s support for Greece’s efforts to retrieve the Parthenon Sculptures from England unexpected?
Frankly, Turkey’s support is not unexpected. The Parthenon Marbles is already a matter on which Greece is never alone. Turkey’s support is both sincere and deep-rooted and not new. It has continued uninterruptedly with a non-political approach. Likewise, Greece’s support for Turkey in combating cultural heritage smuggling is equally vital.
I think the reason behind making Athens so happy is your statement about a controversial document. For years, the United Kingdom has claimed an Ottoman decree granted permission for the artefacts to be taken to England.
Absolutely. The difference in this year’s session was Turkey coming forward and saying, “There is no such document.” England claimed that these artefacts were purchased legally from the Ottomans, according to Ottoman laws. As in Turkey, we had to respond. I needed to correct this. Otherwise, as a member of a country holding the Ottoman State archives, I would have accepted this claim.
We need a document showing that the Parthenon was legally acquired during the Ottoman period. There is only one translation mentioned in England. I need to see the original alongside it to call something a translation. So that there is a reference point. There is only something written in Italian on paper… No Ottoman seal, no sultan’s monogram…
So, it’s like a piece of note?
I wouldn’t want to say it like that, but in a way, yes. At least I can tell, “It has no official status.” I know Turkey’s stance had a significant impact.
It is perceived as if it changed something. However, over the years, I have seen the great sacrifices and efforts the Greek delegation has made.
What if England says, “Then let’s look at your archives”?
Many British researchers have already come to Turkey. Not just at the government level. Many academics have come to Turkey and conducted research in the state archives. The Ottoman State Archives are already open to the public. This is not something we are hiding. So, I say to England in response to this claim, “If we don’t have documentation, wouldn’t it be better not to make such a claim?”
You represent Turkey at the ministerial level. However, you are primarily a cultural person. You say, “You don’t discriminate based on religion, language, or race; we unite in the effort to reclaim our cultural heritage; friendship transcends borders.” Are the recent developments a concrete result of the détente policy in Turkey-Greece relations that began towards the end of last year? Or is it an ongoing cultural collaboration that is independent of this?
I support the second option. The first option also influenced the growth of the second. When relations between the two countries are better, when the winds of friendship blow, the manoeuvring areas of every nation naturally expand; this is a fact. But believe me, it would have been said earlier if this had happened. It was a very natural comment made by Turkey. It was related to the moment; it was not planned. As you know, Turkey’s Minister of Culture Mehmet Nuri Ersoy recently visited Greece and met with his counterpart there. Following these meetings, his Greek counterpart briefed him on the matter.
When the Minister returned to Turkey, he requested information from us. He said, “Let’s always continue this support; I want to be informed of all developments. This is a global issue where Turkey needs to show its stance.” These are not insignificant developments. However, on an expert level, Turkey and Greece have always supported each other in a non-political, technical manner.
Is the British Museum now obliged to return the Parthenon Sculptures?
We know how much the habits of collecting and collection practices have harmed cultural assets and how much they have fragmented and destroyed them. I wish the British Museum would return them… We are used to seeing moves related to England that will be turning points in human rights and many other areas, milestones in world history.
Of course, we would like to see one of these regarding the Parthenon. We would also like to see this with artefacts belonging to Turkey. So, is the British Museum obliged to return them? The obligation can be debated. But at least in an era where apologies are being made, I would very much like to see the British Museum return these artefacts to Greece.

Ancient Athenian Ostracism,https://medium.com/@theartfulhistorian/ever-wished-you-could-banish-someone-from-your-city-in-ancient-athens-you-could-8cb221002aa6,"Sign up

Thousands of pieces of ostracon have been uncovered in Athens.
These ostraka are pieces of pottery that acted as voting tokens during an ostracism. In an ostracism vote, people (free men) would scratch the name of someone who they believed threatened democracy onto ostraka and if 6000 or more votes were cast, the person with the most votes was banished from Athens for a period of 10 years.
The men who voted in this decision were part of the Athenian Assembly (Ekklesia), which was made up of adult citizen men. These men made up a fairly small percentage of the 30,000–60,000 large population which was also made up of women, enslaved people and foreign-born residents.
Ostracism did not happen automatically, the assembly had to vote each year in favour of holding one and often they were not called. In the 71-year period that ostracisms took place (487 BCE — 416 BCE), only 13 individuals were ostracised.
If the vote was to be held, the actual ostracism poll would happen two months later. The voting process was called the ostracophoria, meaning ‘election to ostracise’.
The unlucky individual who ‘won’ the vote had 10 days to put their affairs in order before they had to leave with no* possibility of return before a decade was up. If one did try to reenter Athens during this time, they faced the possibility of the death penalty.
Despite these harsh terms, an ostracised individual was still allowed to keep any property they owned and could still be considered a citizen of Athens, which, as stated earlier, was a privilege which was not extended to everyone. Further, on return to Athens, it seemed that little changed for the outcast and they could return to politics with significant social status.
No politician was safe from ostracism and it was extremely common for a senior member of the state to have to take a 10-year ‘break’ from Athens due to the vote. One such example was Themistocles, a non-aristocratic politician and general of the 5th-6th centuries BCE who had succeeded in leading Greece to triumph over their enemy, Persia. At one point, Themistocles was one of the most famous and important politicians in Athens, meaning that he was a threat to democracy.
The pieces of ostracon above hold the names, top to bottom, of Pericles (politician and general), Cimon (politician and general), and Aristides (politician). Pericles is the man who put into motion the building program that created the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis. Aristides is one of the lucky banished men who actually got to return to Athens before his ten years were up. Aristides was ostracised in 482 BCE but was recalled to the city-state in 479 BCE to help Athens get ready for the upcoming war against Persia.
Although the purpose of the ostracism was to vote out somebody who became too powerful, it’s likely many people just voted for the person they liked the least. Some of the votes found in ancient rubbish dumps seem to have had a message of personal grievance. Some names had the added epithets of “traitor”, “slanderer” or “adulterer”. The politician Cimon, whose name can be seen on a piece of ostracon in the above picture, had his personal scandal alluded to by at least one angry voter. Smithsonian Magazine writes that one ostracon had the words “Kimon Miltiadou, take Elpinike and go!” etched onto it, Elpinike being the half-sister he was rumoured to have had an affair with.
For better or for worse, the last ostracism took place in Athens in 416 BCE.
Should we bring ostracism back? It seems like a much faster and more efficient way of non-violently removing people from authority, than the bureaucracy that keeps politicians in check today. I, for one, am a fan.

Imagine walking in the footsteps of the greatest thinkers of all time, witnessing their lively debates, learning from their wisdom, and participating in their democracy. This is what it was like to visit the Agora of Athens, the heart and soul of ancient Greece.
The Agora was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
In this article, we will take you on a virtual tour of the Agora of Athens, and show you how you can think like a Greek. We will explore the fascinating world of the philosophers, who challenged the status quo, questioned everything, and sought the truth. We will also discover the secrets of the citizens, who practiced direct democracy, exercised their rights and duties, and defended their freedom. And we will admire the beauty of the gods, who inspired awe, devotion, and art.
Are you ready to embark on this journey? Then let’s go to the Agora of Athens, and learn how to think like a Greek.
The Agora was the birthplace of Western philosophy, where Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle taught and debated. These three philosophers are known as the founders of the classical tradition of philosophy, and their ideas have influenced countless thinkers and fields of study throughout history. But who were they, and what did they teach?
Socrates was the oldest and most controversial of the three philosophers. He was born around 470 BC, and he spent most of his life in the Agora, engaging in conversations with anyone who would listen. He did not write anything himself, but his words and deeds were recorded by his followers, especially Plato.
Socrates was famous for his method of questioning everything and everyone, often annoying the authorities and the public. He believed that the only way to find the truth was to examine one’s own beliefs and assumptions, and to expose the contradictions and ignorance that lay beneath them. He once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
Socrates was interested in ethical and political questions, such as what is justice, what is virtue, and how should one live. He claimed that he did not know the answers, but that he was seeking them with the help of his interlocutors. He also claimed that he was guided by a divine voice, or a daimon, that warned him of what not to do.
Socrates’ relentless questioning and criticism of the established norms and values of his society earned him many enemies, especially among the powerful and the wealthy. He was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety, and he was brought to trial in 399 BC. He defended himself with eloquence and wit, but he refused to compromise his principles or to escape from prison. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
Socrates’ death was a tragic and heroic event that marked the end of an era, but also the beginning of a legacy. His followers, especially Plato, continued his mission of seeking the truth and questioning the conventional wisdom. Socrates became a symbol of courage, wisdom, and integrity, and his example inspired generations of philosophers and thinkers.
Plato was the most devoted and influential student of Socrates. He was born around 428 BC, and he came from a wealthy and noble family. He was interested in poetry and politics, but he abandoned these pursuits after meeting Socrates and becoming his disciple. He followed Socrates everywhere, and he recorded his dialogues and teachings in his writings.
Plato was the founder of the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He established the Academy in 387 BC, near the sacred grove of Academus, outside the walls of Athens. The Academy was a place where students and scholars could study and discuss various subjects, such as mathematics, astronomy, music, and philosophy. The Academy attracted many brilliant minds, such as Aristotle, Euclid, and Archimedes.
Plato was the author of many dialogues, which are considered the most important and influential works of philosophy. In his dialogues, he used the form of a conversation between Socrates and other characters, such as his friends, enemies, or famous figures. He used this form to explore various topics, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, morality, beauty, and justice. He also used this form to present his own views and arguments, often through the mouth of Socrates.
Plato was an idealist, who believed that there was a higher and perfect realm of ideas, or forms, that existed beyond the physical and changing world. He believed that the forms were the true essence and models of everything that exists, and that they could only be known by reason and intuition. He also believed that the forms were the source of goodness, beauty, and justice, and that the goal of human life was to achieve harmony and alignment with them. He once said, “Philosophy begins in wonder.”
Plato was also a visionary, who imagined the ideal state and the ideal ruler in his most famous dialogue, the Republic. In the Republic, he argued that the state should be governed by the philosopher-king, who had the knowledge and the virtue to rule wisely and justly. He also argued that the state should be divided into three classes, according to their natural abilities and roles: the guardians, who were the rulers and protectors; the auxiliaries, who were the soldiers and helpers; and the producers, who were the farmers and craftsmen. He also argued that the state should provide education, censorship, and eugenics, to ensure the harmony and stability of the society.
Plato’s ideas and writings have had a profound and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most original thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
Aristotle was the most brilliant and prolific student of Plato. He was born in 384 BC, in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He was the son of a physician, and he had a natural curiosity and interest in the natural world. He joined the Academy when he was 17 years old, and he stayed there for 20 years, until the death of Plato. He then left Athens and traveled to various places, such as Asia Minor, Lesbos, and Macedonia. He became the tutor of Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, who conquered most of the known world. He returned to Athens in 335 BC, and he founded his own school, the Lyceum, where he taught and wrote until his death in 322 BC.
Aristotle was the author of many works, which cover almost every field of knowledge, such as logic, ethics, politics, biology, physics, and metaphysics. He wrote in a systematic and analytical style, using observation, classification, and deduction. He was the first to develop a comprehensive and coherent system of philosophy, which aimed to explain the nature and causes of everything that exists.
Aristotle was an empiricist, who believed that knowledge was derived from experience and observation of the physical world. He rejected Plato’s theory of forms, and he argued that the essence and form of a thing were inseparable from its matter and substance. He also argued that the world was composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire, and that each element had a natural place and motion. He also argued that the world was governed by four causes: the material cause, which was the matter of a thing; the formal cause, which was the shape and structure of a thing; the efficient cause, which was the agent or force that produced a thing; and the final cause, which was the purpose or goal of a thing. He once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
Aristotle was also a practical and ethical thinker, who was interested in the best way of living and the best form of government. He wrote the Nicomachean Ethics, which is considered one of the most influential works of moral philosophy. In the Nicomachean Ethics, he argued that the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life was happiness, which he defined as the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. He also argued that there were two types of virtue: intellectual virtue, which was acquired by learning and reasoning; and moral virtue, which was acquired by habit and practice. He also argued that virtue was a mean between two extremes, or vices, and that it required practical wisdom and moral judgment.
Aristotle also wrote the Politics, which is considered one of the most influential works of political philosophy. In the Politics, he argued that the state was a natural and necessary institution, which arose from the human need for social and political association. He also argued that there were different types of states, according to their constitution and their aim. He classified the states into six categories, based on the number and the quality of the rulers: monarchy, aristocracy, and polity, which were the good forms; and tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy, which were the bad forms. He also argued that the best form of state was the polity, which was a mixed and balanced constitution, where the middle class had the power and the common good was the aim.
Aristotle’s ideas and writings have had a tremendous and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
The Agora was also the center of Athenian democracy, where citizens voted and served as jurors. Athens was the first city-state to adopt a system of direct democracy, where every male citizen had the right and the duty to participate in the government. The Agora was where they gathered to elect magistrates, pass laws, and decide on war and peace. The Agora was also where they held trials, where citizens acted as both judges and jurors. One of the most famous trials was that of Socrates, who was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
But what exactly was democracy? And how did it work in Athens?
The word democracy means “rule by the people” in ancient Greek. It was a radical and revolutionary idea, that challenged the traditional forms of government, such as monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. It was based on the principle of equality, that all citizens had the same rights and responsibilities, regardless of their wealth, status, or birth. It was also based on the principle of freedom, that all citizens had the liberty to express their opinions, to choose their leaders, and to hold them accountable.
Democracy in Athens was not the same as democracy today. It was a direct and participatory democracy, where citizens made decisions by themselves, without representatives or intermediaries. It was also an exclusive and limited democracy, where only adult male citizens had the right to vote, while women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. It was also a fragile and unstable democracy, where factions, conflicts, and coups threatened its survival.
Democracy in Athens was practiced mainly in two institutions: the Assembly and the Courts. The Assembly was the main legislative and executive body, where citizens met at least once a month, and sometimes more often, to discuss and vote on various issues, such as laws, decrees, taxes, treaties, and wars. The Assembly was open to all citizens, who could attend, speak, and vote. The Assembly was also the supreme authority, that could elect, appoint, or dismiss magistrates, such as generals, treasurers, or archons. The Assembly was also the sovereign body, that could revise, amend, or abolish the constitution, or the fundamental laws of the state.
The Courts were the main judicial body, where citizens served as judges and jurors. The Courts were divided into several types, according to the nature and the amount of the cases, such as civil, criminal, public, or private. The Courts were composed of a large number of citizens, who were selected by lot, or randomly, from a pool of volunteers. The Courts were independent and autonomous, that could not be influenced or controlled by the Assembly or the magistrates. The Courts were also powerful and decisive, that could impose penalties, such as fines, exile, or death.
Democracy in Athens was a remarkable and unprecedented experiment, that inspired and influenced many other states and civilizations. It was also a challenging and demanding system, that required the active and informed participation of the citizens. It was also a noble and admirable ideal, that sought to achieve the common good and the public interest.
The Agora was also the place where temples and altars were dedicated to various gods and goddesses. The ancient Greeks were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods, each with their own personality and domain. The Agora had shrines for Zeus, the king of the gods; Athena, the patron goddess of Athens; Apollo, the god of the sun and music; Ares, the god of war; and many others. The Agora was also where religious festivals and ceremonies were held, such as the Panathenaia, the most important festival in honor of Athena. The festival included athletic contests, musical competitions, sacrifices, and a procession that carried a new robe for the statue of Athena.
But who were these gods and goddesses? And how did they influence the life and culture of the ancient Greeks?
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the personifications of the natural forces and phenomena, such as the sky, the sea, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the fire, the thunder, the rain, and the seasons. They were also the patrons and protectors of various aspects of human life, such as love, war, wisdom, justice, beauty, agriculture, commerce, and art. They were also the ancestors and relatives of the heroes and the legends, such as Hercules, Perseus, and Jason.
The ancient Greeks had a complex and rich mythology, that explained the origin and the history of the world, the gods, and the humans. They believed that the world was created by Chaos, the primordial void, from which emerged the first gods, such as Gaia, the earth; Uranus, the sky; and Tartarus, the underworld. They also believed that the gods were involved in a series of conflicts and wars, such as the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians; and the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the Olympians. They also believed that the gods interacted and intervened in the affairs of the humans, sometimes helping, sometimes harming, and sometimes falling in love with them.
The ancient Greeks worshipped and honored the gods in various ways, such as building temples and altars, making sacrifices and offerings, performing rituals and ceremonies, and holding festivals and games. They also sought the favor and the guidance of the gods, by consulting oracles and diviners, by making vows and prayers, and by following omens and signs. They also feared and respected the gods, by obeying their laws and commands, by avoiding their wrath and punishment, and by accepting their fate and will.
The ancient Greeks also expressed their admiration and devotion to the gods through art and literature, such as sculpture, painting, pottery, poetry, and drama. They created magnificent and realistic statues of the gods, such as the statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They also depicted the gods and their stories on various objects, such as vases, coins, and jewelry. They also composed epic and lyrical poems about the gods and their deeds, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer, and the Theogony and the Works and Days by Hesiod. They also wrote and performed tragic and comic plays about the gods and their relations with the humans, such as the Oresteia by Aeschylus, the Oedipus Rex by Sophocles, and the Bacchae by Euripides.
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the sources of awe and art, that inspired and influenced the life and culture of the ancient Greeks. They were also the symbols and the expressions of the values and the ideals of the ancient Greeks, such as courage, wisdom, beauty, and justice. They were also the reflections and the projections of the hopes and the fears of the ancient Greeks, such as love, war, fate, and death.
The Agora of Athens was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens witnessed the rise and fall of the Athenian democracy, the glory and tragedy of the Greek civilization, and the birth and development of the Western thought. It was the place where Socrates questioned and challenged, where Plato dreamed and idealized, where Aristotle observed and analyzed, where citizens voted and debated, where gods were worshipped and honored, and where art and literature were created and celebrated.
The Agora of Athens is a place that still inspires us today, and that we can learn from and admire. It is a place that reminds us of the achievements and the challenges of the human spirit, of the values and the ideals of the human society, and of the hopes and the fears of the human condition.
If you ever have the chance to visit Athens, don’t miss the opportunity to see the Agora for yourself. You will feel like you are traveling back in time, and you will discover the roots of Western civilization. You will also feel like you are connecting with the ancient Greeks, and you will understand their worldview and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens is not just a historical site. It is a living and breathing museum, where you can see, touch, and feel the history, the culture, and the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. It is also a vibrant and lively square, where you can meet, talk, and interact with the modern Greeks, who are the descendants and the inheritors of the ancient Greeks.
The Agora of Athens is a place where you can think like a Greek, act like a Greek, and be like a Greek. It is a place where you can experience the past, the present, and the future of the Greek civilization. It is a place where you can find yourself, lose yourself, and rediscover yourself.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you will never forget, and that you will always remember. It is a place that will change you, and that you will change. It is a place that will challenge you, and that you will challenge. It is a place that will inspire you, and that you will inspire.
The Agora of Athens is a place that awaits you, and that you await. It is a place that welcomes you, and that you welcome. It is a place that invites you, and that you invite.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should visit, and that you will visit. It is a place that you should see, and that you will see. It is a place that you should know, and that you will know.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should love, and that you will love.

This artwork contains the presence of humans. There are many people gathering up against each other while doing what seems to be studying. Proven by the books they carried and read, these figures represent all of the greatest mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists that lived in that specific decade. Dozens of these geniuses all gathered around to discuss, sharing their ideas, expressing their opinions, and learning from each other. The architectural yet enormous building is mostly painted white. Some figures lay on the ground, reading and conversing. Some are upstairs gathering together, making a little crowd. The color palette was mostly vibrant, but washed out. Yet you can still see the soft contrast between the people’s clothes and backgrounds.
The artist used shapes such as cubes, rounded, and curved to create perspectives on the architectural building. At the front, we can see the building’s perspective from the curved line on the roof. But the overall structure of the building was probably cubed or a block. These different and neatly spread types of shapes made the artwork look more composed. The whole composition looked like it was moving. Because the artist made designs of people interacting with one another, they also made the color palette soft, so it radiates peacefulness. The central interest of this artwork is the two main characters that were painted in the middle of the commotion. It was obvious to spot them since the other individuals were all gathering around them. The artist succeeded in gaining my attention to the two by highlighting the middle of the painting. As you can see, the area where they stand is a bit lighter than the rest. Such little details make the biggest difference when it comes to painting.
The painting took place during the historical era of Plato. Let’s analyze the most distinctive element, which is the two people that were standing in the middle. Research claims that the two characters happen to be Plato and Aristotle. Plato was wearing red and purple. This color symbolizes the color of spirituality. A color that inspires reflection and self-awareness. While Aristotle was wearing blue with brown, which symbolizes the sky, sea, and earth, it also represents reliability and wisdom. These are the two main elements that the artist wanted to show through the main characters. The overall mood of the painting has a sign of coolness and warmth at the same time. The cool color tones that were used actually made the mood warm because the amount of commotion made the painting somewhat peaceful and relaxing to see. The landscape came off as natural, as the painting used a little bit of green for the building, so the piece itself was naturalistic. The object of the monument was already perfect because it holds and completes the inside of the painting, which is the people.
Paragraph one explains what is happening in the painting. We already knew they were discussing and trying to express their thoughts. This represents all of the different opinions and answers between people. The painting shows us geniuses. Mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. Yet they are gathering together, trying to find and gain answers. This shows that everyone can disagree with one another. They can have different thoughts and philosophies about one case. The artist is trying to say that even if we are concerned and confused about a single matter, humans will try to find a way to solve it. The main theme behind this piece is the high Renaissance. If I were inside The School of Athens, I would probably try to catch up on the topic that was being discussed, so I wouldn’t feel left out. The story behind this art is that it’s positioned facing Disputa and symbolizes philosophy, setting up a contrast between religious and lay beliefs. The painting is abstract because it looks at other non-objective artistic elements of shape, form, and color. The artist explored his ideas beyond the canvas and physical reality. I would explain this artwork as a painting where people gathered up all their ideas. As proven by the painting itself and the dozen people there.
Raphael had created a masterpiece and expressive drawing. The soft and cool tones he used added to the overall feeling of composure, calm, and relaxation. The unseen movement between the people makes me feel at ease just by looking at it. The faint green tones developed a sign of liveliness and nature. For me personally, this artwork does not need any improvements, as it is already perfect and has met the criteria for being the aesthetic theory of Renaissance art.

Initially, I was skeptical. In the age of Covid, do people even attend conferences anymore? With free educational content on YouTube and virtual conferences on Zoom, what’s the point? Despite my doubts, I found myself driving to Athens to participate in Devoxx 2023. Devoxx Greece is a three-day event where developer communities gather to discover the latest technological advancements, presented by some of the most inspiring speakers in the industry. The Devoxx family, which includes Belgium, France, UK, Poland, Marocco, and Ukraine, welcomes over 15,000 Devoxxians annually!
To my surprise, the conference was exceptionally well-organized, and the turnout was impressive. Four large rooms were filled with enthusiastic attendees, eager to absorb the knowledge shared in each session. The talks were organized into the following tracks: Architecture, Containers & Infrastructure, Data & AI, Development Practices, Java, UI & UX, Programming Languages, and Security. In this post, I will share my impressions and key takeaways from the talks I attended.
But first some pictures from the venue and the event.
Let’s see some of the main points for the talks that I had attended and enjoyed :-)
Ted aimed to bridge the gap between developers and managers in his well-prepared talk, which was filled with numerous real-life examples from his own experiences. The presentation focused on the key responsibilities of managers, such as assembling strong teams rather than just hiring star programmers, fostering an environment that helps developers achieve a state of flow, minimizing disruptions by reducing unnecessary meetings, and even making tough decisions like relocating or dismissing individuals who negatively impact team dynamics.
Natalie, a Community Ambassador for OpenAI, showcased the latest advancements in AI, specifically focusing on transformers. One notable takeaway from her presentation was the introduction of Phind, an impressive AI-powered search engine designed for developers. This innovative tool not only cites sources but also automatically generates follow-up questions, among other features.
Apache Kafka has become the go-to standard for high-performance data streaming applications. Such applications are rarely focused solely on message processing; they often need to integrate Kafka messages with remote endpoints, store messages in a datastore, or relay them to third-party services.
Ozan from Red Hat showcased how Quarkus, combined with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, can be used to build Kafka-based event-driven architectures. Quarkus is a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework designed for creating Java applications. Using a sample application, Ozan demonstrated the key concepts and common patterns, illustrating how Quarkus simplifies the development of event-driven microservices and integrates seamlessly with Quarkus’ reactive core.
What an incredible talk! Dan delved into a fascinating concept: leveraging the untapped potential of a company’s computers by running tasks in Chrome tabs. Each tab functions as an isolated environment and boasts a robust API. So, why not utilize the browsers within an organization to act as containers for running workloads, ultimately saving money on servers? I’m eager to get my hands on the source code he demonstrated!
Eliza from Amity showed how she can effectively create with the help of Generative models technical (code) and nontechnical presentations with a clear structure, slides with bullet points, images, and or even videos.
Jane introduced us to Qwik, a novel JavaScript framework that employs a unique rendering paradigm called “resumability.” This approach allows a JavaScript app to be serialized into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique commonly used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. Qwik enables the creation of “resumable apps” that require minimal JavaScript for interactivity and employ fine-grained lazy loading to load only the necessary components. Jane’s talk provided guidance on getting started with Qwik.
The key points covered in her presentation included: understanding the Qwik framework, comparing Qwik to React and Angular, strategies for reducing the size of JS bundles, and a tutorial on building with Qwik. The presentation piqued my interest, and I’m eager to give Qwik a try.
Dionysis, the Director of DevOps at GWI, showed us OPA: Open Policy Agent, which makes it possible to write policies that test the changes Terraform is about to make before it makes them. Also, he combined OPA with another open-source tool called infracost that calculates the cost of a terraform plan. This way he can also test and limit the cost of a terraform plan before actually applying it. Nice ideas for our DevOps!
Frank, a principal at Databricks, delivered a lively and engaging presentation on Data Lakehouse, a new platform from Databricks that blends the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. This innovative approach provides the reliability, robust governance, and performance associated with data warehouses, while also offering the openness, flexibility, and machine learning support characteristic of data lakes. Essentially, data is stored at the S3 level, but ACID transactions can be performed on top of it. An important takeaway from the presentation was that the term “real-time pipelines” may be somewhat misleading, as there is always a slight latency. Additionally, Frank introduced the appealing concept of continuously ingesting all data and replacing traditional ELT pipelines with streaming pipelines — truly cutting-edge ideas!
Emilia, a software engineer specializing in mobile gaming technologies, shared insights from psychology and cognitive sciences to illustrate how their application can lead to more effective user experiences, both positively and negatively.
Key topics covered in her presentation included dual process theory, heuristics, the illusory truth effect, the paradox of choice, priming, and inadvertent priming, among others.
(Note to myself from the talk: The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over other from William James)
In his presentation, Mohammed, an avid Formula 1 enthusiast, explored how we can make our code deployments as secure as Formula 1 races. Drawing from various principles employed in F1, he demonstrated how we can learn from and adopt these concepts in the way we design, structure, deliver, and safeguard our systems.
The talk covered:
+ Importance of having a trusted and adversarial CI/CD pipeline
+ Security patterns: Least privileged principal, defence in depth, Zero trust
+ Resiliency patterns: Micro-segmentation, Anti-overload patterns
+ Monitoring and alerting
In Cassandra’s presentation, she offered a wealth of both theoretical and practical guidance on leveraging social media, podcasting, and YouTube to establish a meaningful personal brand that not only benefits one’s career but also contributes to the community. These platforms have evolved from simply being enjoyable ways to share our lives and connect with others to becoming essential tools for networking and career advancement. During the talk, attendees heard about individuals whose personal brands played a key role in their success as esteemed developers, managers, and community leaders. Participants learned how to utilize their online presence for career growth and received valuable insights on best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for striking a balance between professional and personal content.
In this presentation, Chris discusses the approach they devised for executing chaos engineering scenarios. The aim was to conduct exercises for new team members, acquainting them with alarms and the complete incident response procedure to ensure their preparedness for real situations. He demonstrated the rationale behind conducting such experiments, the design process, implementation, and ultimately, the evaluation and application of the solution.
This is a brief summary of some of the talks I attended. I’d like to thank the Devoxx team for organizing such a professionally-run conference. The audience was genuinely enthusiastic, and many valuable and meaningful conversations and connections took place. Be sure to visit Devoxx’s official website or Facebook page. I’ll attempt to share my impressions of the remaining talks in a future post.

What is Western Civilization and where did it come from?
This is the question I have been seeking answers to which has guided much of my reading. Today, those answers are coming from Jacob Howland’s book, Plato and the Talmud.
I first heard of the idea that Western Civilization is a combination of Athens and Jerusalem from Ben Shapiro in his book The Right Side of History. It made some sense to me then but the more I dig, the more sense it makes. There is a resistance for some people to understand and even admit that much of our culture is Biblically derived, but I don’t see any way around it.
At this point, I don’t think anyone can understand Western Civilization without an understanding of the Bible in the same way that we would expect them to understand Greek philosophy. And when someone tries to convince me otherwise, I take it as evidence that they don’t understand our civilization and will not until they get over that hump.
What Howland is doing in this book is comparing those two distinct lines of thought and describing their similarities and their differences.
One major difference which I have suspected is a key ingredient in the Bible missing from…

Before you start reading, I bet you’re wondering what exactly is a Perrucha: it is not any type of dog, or parrot (as in French), it is simply a term of endearment for those who feel independent, like to explore, to discover (and discover themselves), or what Charli XCX called a Brat. It means someone who is open minded and likes to have fun, and to mix with real people. If you’d like to visit only fancy places, there are other guides for you. When I visit a city, in Perrucha mode, I like to let the city tell a story, of the good and the bad sides, everything that makes it what it is.
As for Athens, you will se it has graffiti, the Acropolis, beautiful museums, sandy beaches, a vibrant music scene, an anarchist neighborhood, and one of the most welcoming people I have ever met. And just wait till you taste the food!
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home. Coming from a Latin American city, I believe it was the mix of beauty and chaos which won me over. Ever since, I’ve felt the need to return and keep exploring. I hope this guide will give you some tips that go beyond the main touristic areas and things to do, the same way I like to share my recommendations with my friends (this way I can also get them to read what I write).
If you are an international traveler, you will probably get to Athens by air -to the international airport Eleftherios Venizelos, commonly initialised as AIA-, or by sea -to Piraeus Port. If you get to the Port, you can easily take Line 3 to the city center, to the airport, or just get a taxi.
Going to the city center from the airport has quickly improved in the past 10 years, now you can just take the line 3 of the metro directly — approximated cost is 9€ per person. A trip to the city center (Syntagma Square), will take approximately 40 minutes. Uber is connected to the Taxi services, which you can also take to and from the airport.
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home…
You can order taxis via Uber and Freenow (only official taxis exist and use the meter), or take the metro/buses (as the metro won’t take you everywhere). The metro is quite clean and useful to get to and from the international airport.
In the Greek capital, I would say most of the people speak English, and all over Greece the road signs are in both Greek and English, I imagine because Greek is not so popular outside Greece. However, once you move to more retired places, having Google translate (or other apps) comes in handy, even if the younger generations speak English, you may find yourself ordering random items on the menu. In any case, people will most of the times be ready to help you, even if they don’t speak your language.
In short, with a metro card, basic English, and a positive attitude, you can easily move around.
You have two main areas you can choose from: enjoy the historical city center, or stay somewhere closer to the beach.
If you prefer the historical city center, you can try areas such as Plaka and Koukaki, which are walking distance to the Acropolis and full of restaurants and bars. You also have easy access to the metro. This areas are mainly touristic, especially Plaka; I personally prefer Koukaki for its chill vibes and it still walking distance to famous monuments like the Acropolis.
I would avoid areas such as Omonia and Monistiraki, even though they might offer cheaper options, they’re very busy and not as charming as other areas. The same goes for Pireas Port area, it’s not a place to hang out, unless you want to photograph ferries.
On a whole other vibe there is Exarcheia, the anarchist neighborhood. The neighborhood features a maze of architectural styles, bohemian shops, second-hand stores, record shops, and bookstores. Also amazing bars and restaurants for really good prices.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area. Since there is no metro to go there (there might be in the future), the closer you stay to the beach, the cheaper the taxi (duh). If you go further South, you can even visit Vouliagmeni Lake, also worth seeing.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area.
There is also an option in between the historical city center and the beaches: Paleo Firios, which is walking distance from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, an iconic building housing a library, an opera, a rooftop, and it’s a more residential neighborhood.
First and foremost, in Plaka neighborhood, go all the way up to the Acropolis. In front, instead of paying to enter the museum, which is empty (you can see the pieces in the British or Louvre Museums), just go to the museum restaurant and take pictures from there.
On Sundays see the change of guard in Syntagma Square.
Walk around Monastiraki square. See Filopapo’s hill (Socrates Prison) for the view (Colina Filopappou). If you have extra time you can go up the Mount Likavittos up the hill’s transport.
Walk around Exarcheia (the anarchist neighborhood) and discover the restaurants and cafés in a unique setting.
See Renzo Piano’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation if you can (on your way to Pireas port). The sunset from the rooftop bar is breathtaking. From June to August, you can also enjoy a free Open Air Cinema at night.
I insist for the beach lovers: make sure to check out the Vouliagmeni area, there’s even a Lake with a fancy spa. Most people skip the beaches in Athens, but to me they’re worth the visit, plus, the prices are quite affordable, even for the beach clubs.
There’s the small area of Mikrolimano next to the port with nice restaurants and a gorgeous view.
You can take a day trip to see the Delphos Oracle.
You can buy cosmetic products made with olive oil and honey. Just for the fun, go check out Greek pharmacies, they have the best natural cosmetics, a perfect souvenir.
For sports fans: you can visit the city’s multiple stadiums, be that the Olympic Complex built by renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Olympiacos F.C. Stadium near Pireaus, or the AEK Athens F.C. Agia Sophia Stadium in Nea Filadelfia. The locals I talked to are fervent fans of the AEK Athens F.C. and love the atmosphere.
A plus: a 40-minute drive from Athens, you can visit the APIVITA Cosmetics factory. If you’re my friend, you know I wish they would sponsor me since I use all of their products: they’re made of honey or olive oil. The factory visit is free of charge and you can buy their products at factory prices (located at Markopoulo Mesogaias).
Greece has rich culinary traditions and excellent quality ingredients, so it is not too hard to find good food, coffee and wine wherever you go. In my experience, Athens is one of the best cities in the world for cocktails, the attention to detail and creativity is impressive (also for the prices).
My personal favorites are the following:
· Fried cheese in all forms (cheese beignets, cheese pie)- the cheese can be Feta or Saganaki.
· Eel, squid and fish.
· Eggplant salad (spread).
· Greek salad Saganaki gambas (or anything in Saganaki -red- sauce).
· Mezze: small plates to share.
· Souvlaki (meat on a stick).
· Greek Yogurt with fruits, nuts and honey.
· Iced coffee: Greeks take iced coffee very seriously (as anyone should), hence you will have some of the best iced coffee, no matter the way you order it.
· Alcohol: most beers are pils, for darker beers try micro breweries (mostly in Athens).
· Grape liquors: Ouzo, Raki/Tsipouro — with or without Anis, Masticha, Wines.
Greece is a great place to be a vegetarian or vegan, as they have the well-known Mediterranean diet with fresh cheese, tomatoes, olives, cucumber and olive oil.
· Mpakaliarákia (Greek food) — Kidathineon 41
· Lolos — Geor. Olimpiou 5
· Mikrolimano area (Greek food) — 16, Akti Koumoundourou 24
· Try fried feta cheese with honey, moussaka (like lasagna), souvlaki (meat on a stick). Honestly everything is delicious.
· Drink Raki, Ouzo, Tsipouro (with or without anis), Rakómelo and Mastiha.
· six d.o.g.s — Avramiotou 6–8
· Neratzia Café Bistró (great wine bar) — Zan Moreas 6
· Tranzistor — Protogenous 10
· Baba au rum — Klitiou 6
· Rosalia — Valtetsiou 59
· Bolivar Beach Club — Leof. Poseidonos, Alimos 174 55
· Attic Urban Rooftop — Ermou 86
· Migniardise — Veikou 30
· Plaka is great for shopping for souvenirs such as clothes, magnets, food and cosmetics.
· Syd Records — Protogenous 13
· Athens Tattoo Studio — my favorite artist there is @boss_667ttt
· The prices are competitive, so look for the one closest to you and try it out.
Disclosure: make sure to check the listed places on Google Maps to see if they’re still running.
If you have anything you think I missed, feel free to share in the comments.
Having seen Athens, you can take a ferry and continue your trip to the islands, or take a train or car and see the inner part of the country.

Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP) is the largest water utility in Greece providing services to 4.3 million customers. Read how EYDAP is reducing water-energy nexus pressures.
By Robert C. Brears*
EYDAP has launched an ambitious program of renewable energy utilization with the objective of contributing to the optimization of the energy balance across the country and society and exploring the possibility of expanding to new profitable business. The water utility’s involvement in energy can be grouped into the areas of hydropower, cogeneration of heat and power, solar energy, and energy reduction initiatives.
Hydropower
Along the aqueduct system that brings raw water into the Athens area for treatment there are existing energy dissipation works (small waterfalls along the aqueduct). EYDAP is in process of converting these energy dissipation works into energy production plants, therefore taking advantage of the aqueducts’ hydropower potential. These energy production plants consist of temporarily redirected water flowing through a turbine that converts the hydraulic energy potential into electricity by use of a generator. The water then rejoins the aqueduct at a lower elevation and continues its flow to the water treatment plant. To date, EYDAP has constructed six small hydropower plants along its aqueducts located in Kirfi (760 kW), Elikona (650 kW), Kartala Kihairona (1,200 kW), Mandra (630 kW), Evinos Dam (820 kW), and Klidi (590 kW).
Cogeneration
At Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant, which receives 730,000 m³ of wastewater per day, biogas is captured to produce electricity and thermal energy at the Psyttalia heat and power cogeneration plants, with total wattage being 11.4 MWe and a thermal force of 17.3 MWth.
Solar energy
EYDAP has already licensed production for a photovoltaic power station that generates 1,971 MW on its premises of Aharnes. The contract will enable the selling of electricity to the Hellenic Electricity Officer. In addition, EYDAP is exploring the possibility of constructing smaller photovoltaic plants at other company locations.

The Greeks planted colonies widely, from Istanbul to Marseilles to Alexandria. And scattered all over the Mediterranean you will find remains of Greek temples (Wikipedia’s (incomplete) list notes 43 of them; it would be a good project for people to add to that list). But which — whether due to their preservation, or their setting, or their architectural value — are the best to visit? We’ve criss-crossed the Mediterranean in pursuit of the best, and we’re happy to share our list with you.
Overshadowed by the more spectacular Acropolis in Athens, the Hephaestion is under-appreciated. One of the very best preserved of all Greek temples (look at that ceiling!), it’s a must-see for any visitor to Athens. Set in a pleasant if slightly bland park — it’s easy to feel disconnected from the urban fabric of Athens here — it’s not difficult to find a shady place to watch the play of light on the temple’s myriad carved surfaces. Long known as the Theseum and a favorite of 19th century artists, it’s a must-see for lovers of ancient architecture.
In school you hear about Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns, but almost all the best-preserved Greek temples are Doric. At Didyma (Didim, in southwest Turkey) you’ll get your best opportunity to appreciate the Ionic: the Temple of Apollo Didymaios. Be prepared to be impressed: the temple’s platform is almost 400 feet long, and supported an incredible forest of 116 columns each more than six feet in diameter and 60 feet high. Admiring what is left, you begin to grasp the first reason why we have so little of the Ionic: these temples were lofty, ambitious structures. Sixty-foot columns don’t typically stand earthquakes, and when they fall, they shatter. But the Ionic style isn’t only to be admired for its size. These are some of the most elegant, beautiful ruins you will ever see: giant Medusa-heads watch over the ruins, exquisite reliefs ring the column bases, and everything is made of a gleaming marble whose beauty you have to see to believe. The vast temple enclosed an open-air court, where were kept a spring and laurel sacred to Apollo. Bring your Herodotus with you: the sanctuary — generally referred to as “Branchidae” by Herodotus, for the family that maintained the temple — was a key player in the Ionian Revolt, and Father of History recounts all the steps that led to its destruction in 494 B.C.
Delphi, easily reached from Athens, is one of the most touristed places in Greece. But it’ll take a lot more visitors to ruin this incredible mountain sanctuary. Tucked away in a valley the Greeks thought resembled a uterus (delphus), it’s still one of the most spectacular religious sites in the world. The views alone are worth the trip. And while the actual structure of the temple probably won’t overwhelm you, the significance of the place, and the weight of so much emotional human history — for centuries, people came here in the thousands literally looking for answers — still can be felt today. The famed objects are almost all gone — the wooden staff offered by Brutus, Rome’s first consul, or the rich gifts left by Croesus — but reading Pausanias’s account of them all will serve to remind you that this little mountain village was in many ways the spiritual center of the ancient world.
If you think Delphi’s mountain scenery is spectacular, wait til you try a visit to Bassae, a truly remote Greek temple atop a mountain literally in the middle of Arcadia. Most of the year you’ll probably have the place pretty much to yourself, too — if you can get there (it’s accessible only by car or by an expensive taxi). It may be the best-preserved Greek temple in the world, and as such has been the subject of much academic study (and the first to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Supposedly designed by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon, this temple’s beauty and harmony were singled out for praise by Pausanias almost two thousand years ago. And just to see those columns, still standing on that summit after all these centuries, is enough to give the pious traveller chills. The interior frieze was carted off to the British Museum in 1814, where you can still admire it (Mary Beard and John Henderson made the frieze the starting-point for their 2000 volume, Classics: A Very Short Introduction, a suitable companion for your journey in Arcadia).
This site might well have taken the top spot on our list were it not for the fact that in 1987 an enterprising preservationist decided the temple needed to be protected, and that the right way to protect it was to put it beneath a gargantuan latex tent. As you drive up the winding road it appears that the mountain is now crowned not by an extraordinary ancient temple but something rather like a Cyclops’ discarded condom. The temporary structure — which is remarkable-looking on the inside, I will confess — has now been there for almost thirty years. To make matters worse, at times the “preservation works” inside take up all the area inside the tent, and visitors are allowed to visit only the front face of the temple. What was once perhaps the most spectacular place in all Greece is now at times almost completely off limits. Not only that, but the tent has spawned a whole brood of conspiracy theories (“what exactly are they hiding up there? ALIENS?”). But a trip up to this three-thousand-foot-high ridge is to see just how spectacular the Greek architectural imagination could be.
The mountains of Greece are remarkable, but when you think of Greece, you think first and foremost of the sea. The most glorious religious manifestation of this is the temple of Poseidon at Sounion. On a sea-girt promontory jutting into the Aegean, almost every ship bound for Athens came within sight of this clifftop shrine. The structure is decidedly ruinous, but the spectacular setting is forever memorable (as is the signature from Byron carved into one of the pillars). The site history is not complex here — there has been the temple and the sea and the rock and not much else. On summer evenings a crowd gathers at the temple to watch the sunset, with a pleasant holiday vibe. It’s touristy, but the spot is still appreciably wild: I’ve hiked all over the promontory and even camped out there to get a little time alone with the beach.
Cumae is the place where Daedalus landed (without Icarus) after flying away from the Labyrinth, and his wings were supposedly kept in the temple of Apollo there. There’s not much left of the temple today — just the foundations — but the location on an abandoned hillside in Italy overlooking the Mediterranean is second to none. It’s the setting of Book Six of the Aeneid too, and reading Vergil’s lines on-location at the temple will give you shivers. Factor in the remarkable cave structure there, the Roman roads climbing the acropolis, and the temples of Zeus and Artemis nearby, and this is one of the best archaeological sites in the whole Mediterranean. It’s undiscovered too — the crowds all head to Pompeii and Naples just to the south.
Selinunte is one of a trio of top-notch Greek temple sites in Sicily (the other two are Segesta and Agrigento), all of which make our list. On a high plain overlooking the sea and flanked by golden beaches, it’s pretty easy to have a good time at Selinunte: mornings with the temples, afternoons at the beach, and evenings at the clubs. Not only that, but Selinunte boasts five major temple structures and several minor ones sprawling over the largest archaeological park in Italy. “Temple E” (generally presumed to be a temple of Hera) makes for the best pictures — it was re-erected using the original stones — but the whole site is interesting, especially if you can get there before temperatures start to soar.
Once the home of the great warrior Ajax, Aegina, just across the Saronic Gulf from Athens, doesn’t get the love that the more distant Greek islands get, but this temple of the mysterious “disappeared” Earth goddess Aphaia (aphaia means “not appearing”) is something special. It sits atop a hill overlooking the sea, on a quiet part of the island far away from the crowds. The temples of the Acropolis and Sounion are actually visible from here, and there may have been some kind of communication in antiquity from temple to temple with watchfires. The panorama is all big sky, old stone, and blue sea, an essence of Greece refined up through twenty-five hundred years. The temple itself is Doric, from around 500 B.C., and the sculptures from its pediment — now in Munich — stand, like the temple itself, right in that happy borderland between the Archaic Greek period and the full Classical style.
Strolling through the flowery hillsides, you might find it hard to imagine that Segesta once was a city. Almost nothing of the place remains, a fact which makes its two principal ruins all the more striking: an impressively preserved stone theater and an even more perfectly preserved Doric temple. You start by the temple, its unfluted columns aging to the color of sand and ochre; the Sicilian sun marks time’s every stroke upon the stone with a casting of shadow; landscaped grounds display the sun-loving Sicilian vegetation. A half-mile walk up the hill brings you to the theater, cunningly built as most of them are, splendidly preserved and following the line of the hill. Turning back to see the temple set among fields, with the waters of the Mediterranean in the distance and even further beyond, the endless hills of Sicily, you get one of the world’s most picturesque views. Thomas Cole selected precisely this view to produce one of his best Grand Tour keepsake paintings. Past and present seem to join hands here. Even today the temple looks almost brand-new, as if a team of builders threw it up in the past month and have just gone home for the day before coming back tomorrow to put on the roof and give it a final paintjob.
We know, we know, we know: the crowds can be awful, the sun is so glaring your eyes start watering without sunglasses, it’s beastly hot in summer, and parts of the place get roped off for no apparent reason. But it’s the Parthenon, and there’s a reason the crowds keep showing up. The most iconic image of Ancient Greece, the temple of Athena Parthenos is still a standout among Greek temples, for its incredible position at the center of Greece’s greatest city, for the Doric proportions perfectly poised between airy elegance and stony heft, for the gorgeous Pentelic marble that seems to mirror the color of the sun in the sky — pink at sunrise, blinding white at midday, honey-colored in the afternoon — and because it’s the Parthenon. This is the chief monument of “the school of Hellas,” the tangible remainder of Periclean Athens. It’s hard not to be impressed when you’re there. And there’s the rest of the Acropolis to see too — from the Erechtheum on top to the theater of Dionysus below (yes, that theater). There’s a reason why this is all a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’re better off going off-season, but no one who loves Greek temples is going to want to miss this one.
The Italians have chutzpah, and at times it pays off. The temples at Paestum, just south of the Amalfi Coast, face onto a road. There are businesses along the road: a few hotels, a few restaurants, a few bars. This could be a disaster. But it’s not: it’s delightful, and it makes visiting Paestum a real pleasure. The last time I was there I visited a bar where couples and friends were lined up at tables just staring at the sun setting over the Temple of Athena. It seemed like some kind of perfect dream of Mediterranean life. And it’s Italy: the restaurants are fabulous (they’re famous for their mozzarella di bufala), the bars are fabulous. There’s even a hair salon with a temple view. And the temples themselves? They are perfect. Their names have changed over generations, but the one now known as the Temple of Poseidon is one of the standout works of antiquity. The etching Piranesi completed of it — perfectly capturing the mystery of all things old — is perhaps the master’s greatest work. That Paestum comprises multiple temples, that they are so accessible, that there are perfect vantage points from which to draw or contemplate them, that the beach is so close, that the walls of the city form another remarkable attraction reachable by short walks through the fields, that they are visited but not overcrowded, that the place is easily accessed from the train — all these things make a visit to Paestum one of the very best ways to experience Greek temple architecture.
Grand as all the temple sites of Magna Grecia are — Paestum, Segesta, and Selinunte are all on this list — the grandest of them all is Agrigento, the ancient Akragas, where a walk through a grove of almond and olive leads you from magnificent Greek temple to magnificent Greek temple, all of them perched on an impossibly photogenic ridge. The site is hot in summer but truly beautiful all throughout the year, thanks to the warm climate, sea views, and some gorgeous Mediterranean landscaping. The bloom of the almond trees in February is particularly stunning, and the wonderful spread of the site makes it a perfect botanical garden — it’s almost as if the ancients spaced out their temples to cater to the tourist experience.
The so-called Temple of Concordia is the star attraction, a splendidly preserved Doric temple in a warm buff stone, but the site boasts seven temples, all of which are worth visiting, and much besides: the remains of an “Atlas,” part of the temple of Zeus, shows its utterly unique temple design. Alone of all the Greek sites in Italy, the Valley of the Temples has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status. The adjacent town of Agrigento is a kind of miniature Sicily in itself, with ancient, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and modern buildings in a kind of glorious jumble. Olives, sunshine, sculpture, blossom, wine-dark sea, history laid upon history: if you want to get the experience of an ancient Greek temple, it’s pretty hard to beat Agrigento.
You don’t have to choose just one, of course. The best is to find a way to see them all. Have a favorite we left off our list? Feel free to add it in the comments.

(TW: Sexual Assault. Please read with care. Thank you.)
There were none wiser, stronger, or better than her, Athena, the Goddess of wisdom and strength, knew. Victory flowed fresh in her blood of gold — ichor. She had just won the battle of being the patron God of Athens and won from whom but her uncle, the God of the Waters himself! However, she knew Poseidon’s propensity to hold grudges. An attack could be on the way anytime soon. The caution did not stop her from savoring her spoils as her hungry eyes wandered over the capital, looking for a new conquest to engage her. Mortals could be the most entertaining species. Amidst the cacophony of the cosmopolitan city — hawkers crying, officials announcing, and buyers haggling, a mellifluous voice struck her ears.
“Goddess Athena!”
Few things managed to take Athena aback. The woman’s beauty happened to be one of them. Long, golden hair tumbled on her dusky face, which was adorned with a dainty nose and full, red lips. Her white robe contrasted against her skin. The woman was kneeling in the exquisitely built temple of marble, which had been devoted to the Goddess. The mortal continued to heap praises. Well aware of the protocol, the golden-haired maiden stood and draped an embroidered silver robe on Athena’s statue. Divine rays emanated from the statue as Athena deigned to appear in the temple.
“Goddess!” the woman gasped, falling on her knees.
“Rise, maiden.” Athena’s rich, deep voice reverberated in the temple. “What is your name, and whence do you come from?”
“Medusa is my name,” the mortal’s silky voice said. “I am the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto, minor lords of the sea.”
Athena’s eyes hardened. “Lords of the sea, you say?”
“The sea, Goddess. But I am here to devote my heart and soul to your service. I want to be the first priestess of this temple.”
Medusa looked into Athena’s eyes. A sudden current passed in the space between them. The mortal must have felt the exchange of sparks too, for she looked away, red rushing to her cheeks. Athena noticed the blueness of those frail mortal eyes — eyes that were bluer than the sky and deeper than the ocean. Yet, another factor attracted her. Those eyes seemed to contain intelligence and consideration more than most men.
“Answer me, then. What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?”
Medusa did not take time to think. “The answer should be a human. In the morning of life — our childhood — we crawl on all fours. At noon, which is adulthood, we walk upright on two legs. In the evening of our lives, we use a cane as a third leg.”
“Born of the earth, yet a gift divine,I thrive where the sun and soil align.A token of peace, a feast I provide,In oil or fruit, I’m prized worldwide.What am I?”
Medusa smiled in recognition. “Your gift to us, Goddess, what else? The people of Athens chose this over Poseidon’s salt water. They are your divinely provided olives.”
Athena continued to grill the woman — on policy, on Gods, on anthropology. Each answer seemed better than the previous and drew Athena closer, till she could hear the mortal’s breaths. Athena knew her presence overwhelmed mortals, yet the maiden held her ground.
“Last question for today,” Athena said.
“I cannot be seen, yet I color your view,I cannot be touched, yet I’m felt through and through.I can bind the mighty, or make the meek bold,A treasure eternal, yet never bought or sold.What am I?”
Athena watched Medusa’s lips as she spoke. “The answer is love, Goddess. The best and the worst feeling in the world.”
A rush of power hit Athena; a unique exhilaration and euphoria made their way to her heart. She could appreciate beauty with brains; she could appreciate a challenge. Medusa remained on her knees, awaiting the judgment.
“Call an official,” said Athena. “I have an important announcement to make.”
And so, one of Athena’s first and grandest temples in Athens got the perfect priestess. The duties, the offerings, and the devotion were at a level unseen by Athena before. At the dawn of every week’s first day, Athena used to appear in the temple to meet the priestess. The Goddess posed riddles, discussed the recent developments in Olympus, or simply shared silence with the mortal. Those times energized the Goddess more than ambrosia could. During those conversations, butterflies flew in Athena’s stomach, and she could see the yearning in the mortal’s eyes. For the time being, she decided to keep her distance and tease the mortal some more. The bountiful sparks added a new flavor to her life.
She looked forward to them eagerly.
Medusa swayed her way to the temple from her home. The sun was rising, the sea reflecting the sky’s oranges and pinks beautifully. A smile touched her lips. Maybe, today would be the day that Athena would close the distance between them. Perhaps Athena was waiting for her to make the move. After all, who would appreciate bravado more than her?
Today, Medusa decided. Today I would say it all.
Just then, drizzle began. Medusa increased her pace, knowing the temple was still a stretch away. Her gut was pounding. A shadow fell on her shoulder. The scent of salt water hit her nose.
“Young lady,” said a hoarse voice. “I have seen none finer than you.”
Medusa turned and gasped. A muscular man with blue robes and dark, long hair towered over her. Yet, he looked more ugly than desirable to her. She clutched her white robe, which told the world that she was devoted to Athena.
“God Poseidon,” Medusa managed to say. “T-thank you for your compliments. I was headed to Goddess Athena’s temple.”
Medusa immediately knew that was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone in Poseidon’s eyes. As he took a step forward, she took a step back, her hands quivering.
Athena, she prayed, over and over. Athena.
Clouds grew darker over her. Huge waves began forming in the sea and crashing over the coast. It seemed that the God grew in size. Medusa fell backwards. Her heart pounded loudly.
“Are you denying the chance to be with me, young lady? Isn’t your name Medusa? Aren’t you the daughter of minor lords under ME?”
“Have mercy,” Medusa said, slithering backwards. “Mercy, Lord, I apologize, I am already devoted to Goddess Athena. ATHENA.”
Thunder crackled. Poseidon fell on her, twisting her arm, making her turn over. Medusa went numb. A golden light flashed somewhere. Poseidon cursed. Momentarily, the weight was removed from her. Through her tears and blood, Medusa saw two great lights clashing. A shrill shriek dominated the air. In horror, she realized Poseidon was coming towards her again as a wounded beast. She tried to stand. A force other than Poseidon hit her then, throwing her back. Poseidon cursed again, his shout shaking the ground. A cold, brutal wave crashed on her. The last thing Medusa was aware of was Athena’s tear-stricken face.
It seemed that she had been unconscious for ages. The ground was hard below, and there was a constant hissing around. When the memories set in, Medusa sat up straight and horrified.
Was it a dream?
She found herself in a cave overlooking the sea. Looking around, she was shocked to see her cousins — the Gorgons — sleeping in the corner. Perhaps Athena had made them guard her. They had their hair as hundreds of tiny snakes, their faces grey and what was generally considered monstrous. The hissing of their snakes filled her head. There was a small pool of water on the other end of the cave. Feeling the thirst, Medusa wandered towards it. Her reflection was not something she was prepared for. That was why the hissing sounded too loud. Her scream was loud enough to disturb the sea.When her throat could scream no more, her ears caught the sound of sobbing. Even without turning, Medusa knew who the person was. Pain like no other twisted in her heart.
“Medusa,” said Athena, her voice cracking. Medusa turned. When once those blue eyes glittered at the sight of the Goddess, now there was only blankness.
Medusa opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. She closed her eyes, hot tears splashing on her cheeks. Whatever had happened had to be a dream. Soon, her body was rocked by hefty sobs. Athena kept apologizing in the background, her eyes as red and swollen.
“If only I had claimed you sooner,” said Athena. “Would that have made a difference?” The Goddess crawled closer to Medusa, whom she had transformed into another Gorgon. “I am sorry, Medusa. I am sorry. I love you. This seemed the only viable solution to drive Poseidon away.” The Goddess gulped. “I could not defeat him.”
Looking at Medusa’s defeated face, Athena grabbed her shoulders, her voice betraying the pain she felt. “Tell me.
“I linger unseen, a shadow in light,I burden the heart, both day and night.I grow with your secrets, thrive on your pain,I bind you in chains, yet leave no stain.What am I?”
Medusa finally stared in the grey eyes. “Guilt.”
Slowly, legends about Medusa spread.
Some of them claimed that she could turn people into stone just by looking at them. Heroes began to seek her out, to win the confidence and support of people around. Medusa’s peaceful life began to be poked at again, by men. Athena knew she had to do something. Every time she thought of the incident, a knife twisted in her chest. Soon, a quiet trip to Hades was made. As depressing and spooky as the underworld was, Athena knew it was the path to Medusa’s salvation. Hades was hard to bargain with, but the presence of Persephone helped. Promptly, two gilded swords that held the power to never miss a strike were transported to Hades. His part of the bargain would come later.
In the meanwhile, a young and promising hero named Perseus, the son of Zeus, was rising in popularity.
One night, Athena paid a visit to him and whispered his task. He had to behead Medusa as painlessly as possible and bring the head to the Goddess. Perseus did not question the specifics and accepted a shield for the task, a shield that shone brighter than gold, that reflected better than a mirror. The hero set off. Athena helped him whenever she could without making it obvious, until he reached the infamous Rock Island.
Athena watched with bated breath.
The day of the final encounter arrived. Perseus entered the cave in the middle of the day. That was usually the time when the Gorgons slept. The statues of people around did not help his nerves. He gripped the shield tightly, a royal sword hanging by his waist, and tiptoed where Medusa slept. The unevenness of the ground made him fumble. He tripped, making the other statues around him crash to the ground. Then, it was deathly silent. His heart stopped as he heard the snarl of Medusa, the hissing of her snakes.
The moment she turned to him, he lifted the shield.
Medusa faltered. Perseus, his eyes closed, swung his sword, praying his strike was right. He heard a thing plop to the ground. Daring to look up, he saw the headless body of Medusa collapsing. The other Gorgons came for him, but Perseus made a dash, dodging over the fallen statues, managing to take the head of Medusa with him.
When the hero was back in his kingdom, Athena paid a visit to him. Perseus handed over the head and the shield back as promised.
After blessing him, she returned to her abode. In the space of her own, she fused the head of her lover with the shield. As she did the task, she knew it would be one of the deadliest weapons. Any ill-intentioned onlooker would be turned to stone through its use. A maiden in trouble could lift the weapon and fight off the attacker easily. Athena went on to keep it safely in the temple where Medusa had reigned for months.
Guilt still weighed heavy in Athena’s chest — no longer did she feel as mighty or as wise.
Yet, Medusa’s hearty afterlife in Elysium — courtesy of Hades — managed to ease some of it. After three attempts of visiting her, Medusa had finally made conversation with her. It had been short, but it was the only thing that had healed some part of Athena.
“Athena,” Medusa had said.
“I am a bridge that mends the torn,A balm where wounds and pain are born.I free the heart, untie the chain,And bring the sun through clouds of rain.
What am I?”
Athena had bowed her head to the spirit, experiencing the bittersweetness of the moment. “Medusa, the woman who opened my eyes and my heart, the answer is forgiveness.”

No other ancient city is as alive for us as Athens at the time of Socrates. Written sources are plentiful, and we do have a lot of Archaeological evidence — especially remarkable are the painted ceramics, showing the inhabitants of Athens in their houses, at the gymnasium, at war and all their other activities. All this allows us to use Plato’s Dialogues as a guide: skipping over the philosophical discussions, together with Socrates, we stroll through the city and enter the houses of its inhabitants.
Socrates reports: ‘At the earliest stages of dawn, Hippocrates came and started beating at my door with his stick; a slave opened the door for him, and he came rushing in and yelled out: Socrates, are you awake or asleep? [Hippocrates brings the news that Protagoras is in town and wants to visit him right away.] ‘Let’s not go there now, my good friend, it’s too early. But let’s go out into the courtyard here and spend the time until sunrise strolling around out…

A walk through history as you tour mill ruins, historic homes, and a battleground at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site.
The site is located about three hours north of St. Louis near the Iowa border.
We first stopped at the former Athens, Mo., General Store. The building is open to the outdoors and now serves as a picnic shelter. Inside you can read signs that describe the history of the store. It was once at the corner of Spring and Thome Street along a path that went down to the ferry that once crossed the Des Moines River.
A nearby sign shows the town at its height from 1853–1860 when it was an important port along the river pre-Civil War.
Next, we saw a monument explaining that the Battle of Athens on Aug. 5, 1861, was the northernmost Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River.
First, a short history lesson to better understand what happened here. Athens prospered until the outbreak of the Civil War. Settled by people from the upper South. Considered by Unionists to be a hotbed of pro-South sentiment. As the spring of 1861 moved into summer, northeast Missourians began choosing sides in the ever-widening national conflict.
Pro-Unionists rallied around David Moore, who had raised a force of about 500 men. Moore entered and occupied Athens on July 24, seizing homes and businesses from pro-South supporters to quarter and provision his troops. Pro-South supporters rallied around Col. Martin Green. Green raised a force of about 3,000 men, including two of Moore’s sons.
The confrontation between Moore’s and Green’s forces took place in Athens on Aug. 5, 1861. The battle began around 5 a.m. Moore and his Unionists were surrounded on three sides by Green’s troops, with the Des Moines River to their rear.
Despite being outnumbered at least five to one, Moore’s men were better trained and equipped.
After about two hours of fighting, at least 50 soldiers had been wounded or killed and the pro-South side was demoralized and in full retreat.
The big loser in the battle was the town of Athens. Bitter feelings between neighbors continued for decades following the Civil War. Athens was also hurt by the shift from the river to railroad transportation in the post-war era. By 1900, the once-thriving town was nearly gone.
(From the Battle of Athens State Historic Site website)
Along a former road, we went by a white picket fence surrounding a foundation. In front, a sign explains what happened after the battle.
A sign in front of the Benning House talks about the forming of Union troops in Northeast Missouri.
We happened to be up at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site when they were conducting tours so the historic homes were open to the public. I would call first to see if they are doing tours before you drive to the site if you want to see the inside of them.
Bedrooms are set up to that period including chamber pots, beds, a chest of drawers, and cabinets along with stoves.
My son pointed out the large piano and a nearby violin.
Fascinating were the intricate details of the patchwork quilt with ducks and even an 1800s girl with schoolbooks.
We then saw the large apple peeler at the end of a cabinet in the kitchen.
The most intriguing aspect of the house is the hole a cannonball left through the kitchen door, through the kitchen, and out the other wall. Although the cannonball harmed no one.
The cannonball fired from the artillery of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard hit the house during the Aug. 5, 1861 battle.
Next, we walked up the road to the Smith Hotel.
Here we found a weaver machine from the 1800s.
A corkboard had photos from the 1800s giving you a sense of the people and houses that were in the town back then.
Andrew checked out the rifles and guns on display.
Next, we walked out to the back where a large cannon is set up on the former battleground. Andrew stood in the back like he was about to fire it.
Then we walked over by the brick Moreland House and Wm. S. French House, abandoned homes in the town.
Next, we went down to the sign for the Mill Trail, which says it is a .3-mile one-way walk. Although, you can do it as a loop since the trail curves back up the hill a short way after passing the mill. This is also shown on the printout of the Mill Trail from the historic site’s website. The total walk is a .4-mile natural surface loop.
Heading down the wide mowed path we pass a ravine that goes into trees.
I spy a white mushroom growing on part of a log.
Below the hill, the trail goes to the left and we saw the brown rock mill remains. These remnants were from a mill constructed by Edward Colton. Built to withstand ice and flooding and stood on a 30-foot stone foundation with an additional four stores and had a water wheel. It was a grist and textile mill until the 1890s.
After checking out the mill we walked a short way along the river before coming to a trail that headed back up the hillside. You could continue along the river, but this is an unlisted trail.
At the top, you can take the White Connector trail to the 2.8-mile natural surface Snow Trillium Trail that goes along the river hills.
We headed back up into the former town to check out the Athens Mill Overlook boardwalk.
This is a good way to see the mill site without having to go down and up the river hill.
Along the boardwalk, you can also see remains of brown rock structures in the woods.
If you like history and ghost towns then this is a worthy trip to make if you are in northeast Missouri. A lot of history in a small area.
A fishing lake, picnic areas, and a playground.
Call 660–877–3871 for more information or to schedule a tour.
Drive: A little over three hour’s drive from the St. Louis Metro. Take Interstate 64 or Interstate 70 to U.S. 61 and go north. North of Wayland, Mo., make a left onto Missouri Highway C then a right onto Missouri Highway 81, and then a right onto Missouri Highway CC that leads to the historic site.
Hours: 7 a.m. — sunset, daily, year-round
Address: State Hwy CC, Revere, MO 63465
A national Civil War battlefield, a frog-shaped rock, and a devil’s elbow are some of what can be seen on the way from St. Louis to Branson!
Dennis Schick Trail includes historic sites and war machinery such as a World War II Sherman Tank in Jefferson Barracks Park in St. Louis County.
If you are heading up to Iowa City from St. Louis another stop is the Swinging Bridge in Columbus Junction, Iowa.
In Columbus Junction, Iowa, you can walk along a swinging bridge that is 262 feet above a dark ravine shrouded in a jungle-like forest.

Athens
Athens, Greece; June 13, 2019
Where to start. It’s so vulnerable to put writing– my ideas materialized for literally anyone to read– out on the internet. Yet, I feel like I need to start blogging. I mean, one day, this will be amazing to read and remember all the details of my life that are so present now. But not only that. I hope you guys (even if the only person reading is my mom) enjoy what you read and take something away from this.
OK. Time to get into what you’re here to read. Greece. Honestly, Greece is a logistical nightmare. Now, don’t get me wrong. Actually being in Greece is incredible. But, the getting there… now that’s a headache. Flying anywhere in Europe is an 8 hour flight or more– that’s a given. But to get to Santorini, it takes a flight from Nashville to New York and then another flight to Athens and then a ferry to the island. That adds up to be almost 24 hours of travel straight. A logistical nightmare. Planning the flights and ferries, doing time change and travel time math… needless to say we were exhausted when we arrived in Athens that first day. We had our ferry to Mykonos booked for the next morning, planning to spend one night in Athens to split up the day of travel. But, when in Athens, you have to visit the Parthenon. So what did we do that day? We visited the Parthenon.
Nashville’s Parthenon had not prepared me for the hike up to and the heat that encompassed the Grecian Parthenon. It was in the upper 90s when we went to the Parthenon, and I was sweating buckets. The Parthenon is on top of this huge peak in Athens, which is amazing in the sense that at the top, you can see a 360* view of the city. But on the other hand, the peak is that much closer to the sun, making walking around on the pavement surrounding the Parthenon feel like you are cooking on a hot grill. The view at the top was insane. Humbling. We could see the entire city below us, seeing the true insignificance of ourselves in the grand scheme of life. Yet, I also felt so important in that moment. The fact that I had traveled so many miles and was lucky enough to experience such an out-of-body moment in the most beautiful country I’d ever been, with the people I loved the most- it was a feeling I can’t find the words to describe.
We made our way down the mountainside (is it a mountain? I don’t really know… maybe a really big hill?) to find ourselves famished. In Europe, the restaurants operate way different from American ones. For one, there are rows and rows of restaurants directly next to each other, all with menus out front and all outdoor seating. Imagine Downtown Franklin, but no indoor seating and all the tables extended into the sidewalk. Also, you have to sit suuuuuper close to the people next to you in Europe when you eat. These are both due to the lack of space and expensive real estate in European cities. See, there are no skyscrapers in Europe; the restaurants are in original buildings. So, when searching for a restaurant, you can see the entire thing from the street and you kind of know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.
We walked down street upon street of crowded restaurants, searching for one that could accommodate the 5 of us and seemed to serve ~gluten free and vegan~ food. We finally found this one, which was literally the first one we saw and somehow skipped. This restaurant was at the foot of the Parthenon, with an incredible view of the Acropolis from below. (It’s called Athina Bistrot, if any of you are ever in Athens and need an amazing restaurant!) We were seated among locals, all of whom were enjoying casual coffee and business meetings amidst our day of tourism.
Another thing about Europe: they don’t serve you water. Ok, that’s dramatic. They do serve you water. But not in the way American restaurants do. Let’s take dinner at Cheesecake Factory for example. You sit and the waiter brings you a glass of water initially, refills when they bring you bread, refills when getting your food order, and again fills your glass when the food comes. And that’s not even including dessert. But in Europe, you have to ask for water and for refills. And the water comes from a glass bottle they leave at your table to refill. And here’s the catch: they charge you for each bottle. So, it is likely that one is dehydrated the majority of the time they are abroad. That being said, my family finished six. Let me repeat. Six bottles of water. Before we had even been served. We were parched–to say the least. Our waiter and the others dining in the restaurant found us comical- the group of 5 American tourists guzzling down upwards of $30 in water.
Our waiter. The reason I am writing this today. Actually, he and I are friends on Facebook so he may see this. So, if you’re reading this, Nikitas– hey! Nikitas was quite the conversationalist. His English was really good, so we were able to chat with him whilst inhaling our Greek salads. Every so often, I would look over into the kitchen to see Nikitas looking fondly at my family.
Every few minutes, Nikitas would come over to our table to check on us and start up a conversation about everything– to life in America and what we had planned for our trip. Here’s another thing about Europe that’s important to know here: they don’t give you the check. Again, I’m being dramatic. They do give you the check. But, in America, the minute you finish eating your food, they give you the check. This table turnover is the way American restaurants operate. The sooner they get you in and out, the more tables they can seat and the more tips they can make. But in Europe, they don’t give you the check immediately, you have to ask for it. European culture centers around eating and community, so the waitstaff don’t rush you out. Secondly, the restaurants in Europe stay open until the early morning hours, so there is not really a rush from the waiters to kick each table out. That being said, we sat at that table for hours sipping on our bottled waters and chatting with Nikitas.
Towards the end of our meal, Nikitas came by again. This time, he told us about his life. He was a single father raising his son, a son he saw as his world. He told us about the countless hours he worked just to make sure his son was well cared for. When Nikitas talked about his son, his eyes sparkled and he beamed. He opened up about how he envied the closeness of our family and how he loved seeing us together, happy.
That one hit home. I realized the true value of the moment I was living. I had all of my family together, at one table, in the most beautiful country, and here’s the kicker. We were happy. I began to think about how this moment was fleeting. Some day I would look back on this moment with such nostalgia, such joy. I felt a twinge of sadness, I knew I would miss this moment and I was currently living in it. Nostalgia for the present is such a powerful thing. I missed this moment before it was even over.
This idea taught me to hold on much tighter to what I experience that is good. I now feel as though I collect moments and memories, rather than let them pass idly by. I have grown to miss moments whilst living them, knowing the exact laughs and conversations are irreplaceable. And after my whole life, not stopping to realize the impermanence memories, it took Nikitas, a waiter in Athens to teach me. I took that lesson and ran. I lived that trip with the intention to remember and cherish every moment.
We left Athens the next morning and embarked on two weeks of Grecian life in Mykonos and Santorini. And trust me, the stories I have about the rest of the trip will be told in their entirety on future blog posts… Get excited ;)
Back to logistics. A ferry back to Athens was the first leg of the trip back home to Nashville. Again, we stayed in Athens for a night before we took a flight to New York and then another one to Nashville. When we arrived in Athens, I knew there was one thing I wanted to do. Eat at that restaurant.
My family and I made our way back to the restaurant he worked at– hoping he would be our waiter again. He was there. A reminder of the fleeting nature of the present and the necessity of cherishing every moment.

Athens is an iconic city with a huge history. I’ve always dreamed of going there and this article will help you enjoy this.
Also, remember that I’m also writing on Medium and that it is very important for me growing a huge community over here so please go and follow my channel with this link : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Athens, the capital of Greece, is a dynamic metropolis in southeastern Europe. With an area of around 39 km², it is relatively small compared to other European capitals, but its cultural and historical wealth makes it a place of exceptional importance.
In 2021, Athens had a population of around 664,046, making it Greece’s most populous city. It is the country’s political, economic and cultural center. The city is famous for its emblematic ancient monuments, including the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the ancient Agora, which bear witness to its rich historical heritage.
Athens is divided into several districts, but has no official arrondissements like some other metropolises. The city has a complex administrative organization, with subdivisions such as districts, municipalities and suburbs.
Geopolitically, Athens is of strategic importance due to its geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea. It plays a central role in Greece’s politics and economy, as well as in the region’s international relations. The city is home to numerous government institutions, embassies and international organizations.
In addition to its historical heritage, Athens is also renowned for its Mediterranean cuisine, lively neighborhoods, colorful markets and vibrant nightlife. Visitors can explore its museums, theaters and art galleries, as well as enjoy the breathtaking views from the Acropolis hill.
Athens, with its fascinating blend of past and present, is a must for travelers seeking history, culture and the excitement of a major European city.
Athens has a rich history stretching back thousands of years, with roots deeply rooted in Greek mythology. Here’s a summary of key moments in the city’s history from its legendary beginnings.
Athens takes its name from the Greek goddess Athena, who is said to have won a contest with Poseidon to become the city’s protector. According to legend, she gave the city an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity, and thus Athens was born.
The first traces of human occupation in Athens date back to the Bronze Age, around 3000 BC. At that time, it was a small farming community.
Athens developed during the Archaic period (800–500 BC), becoming a powerful city-state with a system of government based on nascent democracy.
The 5th century BC is often referred to as Athens’ Golden Age. Under the leadership of Pericles, the city flourished culturally, politically and economically. It was during this period that monuments such as the Parthenon were built.
Athens played a crucial role in the Median Wars (490–479 BC), repelling the Persian invasion and consolidating its position in Greece.
Athens was embroiled in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), a devastating conflict with its rival Sparta. This war weakened Athenian power.
In 338 BC, Athens fell under the domination of Philip II of Macedon, then his son, Alexander the Great.
After the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens lost some of its political importance, but became a cultural center of the Roman Empire.
Under the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, Athens continued to be a prosperous city, although it suffered barbarian invasions and unrest over the centuries.
From the 15th century onwards, Athens fell under Ottoman domination, a period that lasted until the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century.
The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) led to the liberation of Athens and the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830.
Contemporary times: Since independence, Athens has become the capital of Greece, playing a key role in the country’s political, cultural and economic development. It hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has continued to thrive as a cultural and intellectual center.
Today, Athens remains a crossroads of history and culture, bearing witness to its long and fascinating history from its modest mythological beginnings to its status as a dynamic, modern metropolis.
Athens is packed with historic, cultural and picturesque sites to discover as a tourist. Here are ten must-see places to visit when you’re in Athens:
This is Athens’ most emblematic site, home to the majestic Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Theater of Dionysus. The Acropolis offers a panoramic view of the city.
This historic site is home to ancient temples, stelae and monuments. It was the heart of public life in Athens in ancient times.
This world-renowned museum displays an impressive collection of artifacts and sculptures from the Acropolis, providing a valuable backdrop to a visit to the site itself.
Watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony in front of the Parliament building on Syntagma Square. The building itself is a magnificent example of neoclassical architecture.
Explore the winding, picturesque streets of Plaka, one of Athens’ most charming districts, with its boutiques, tavernas and colorful houses.
This museum houses a vast collection of ancient artifacts, including sculptures, jewelry and archaeological treasures, offering a comprehensive overview of Greek history.
Climb to the top of this hill for breathtaking panoramic views of Athens, especially at sunset.
Visit this lively district for its flea market, cafés, vintage stores and the famous Monastiraki square.
Discover this ancient marble stadium, which was restored to host the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
If you have time, take a trip outside Athens to admire the temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, located on the seafront and offering spectacular views of the Aegean Sea.
These sites offer a comprehensive overview of the history, culture and beauty of Athens, giving you an unforgettable experience in this fascinating city.
A world-renowned Greek philosopher, Plato was the founder of the Academy of Athens, one of the world’s first institutions of higher learning. His philosophical dialogues, notably “The Republic”, have influenced Western thought for centuries.
A pupil of Plato, Aristotle was another renowned philosopher from Athens. His contributions to philosophy, biology, politics and metaphysics had a lasting impact on many disciplines.
Athenian historian, Thucydides is the author of “The Peloponnesian War”, a detailed account of the war between Athens and Sparta. His work is considered a masterpiece of history and politics.
An influential Greek politician, Venizelos was Prime Minister of Greece four times in the early 20th century. He played a major role in the reforms and political events of his era, including the Balkan Wars and the First World War.
Actress and politician, Melina Mercouri was a passionate cultural ambassador for Greece. She won the Prix d’interprétation féminine at the Cannes Film Festival in 1960 for her role in “Jamais le dimanche” and served as Greece’s Minister of Culture, fighting for the restitution of the Parthenon marbles.
These Athens personalities have left a lasting imprint in fields ranging from philosophy to politics to cinema, helping to shape the history and culture of Greece and the world.
In order to conclude, if you have any ideas for improving this type of article (adding a section, for example), please let me know in the comments. Also, if there’s a place in the world that you particularly like and would like me to write another article about, I invite you to submit your ideas too.

“Earth proudly wears the Parthenon as the best gem upon her zone.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
In May 2023, my family and I embarked on a memorable trip to Greece.
We had the incredible opportunity to explore the picturesque islands of Santorini and Mykonos. We saved the jewel of our adventure, Athens, for last.
There are direct flights from Athens to the United States, so we were able to spend a few nights in this historic city before returning to the US.
Athens is renowned for its renowned ancient remains and iconic architectural landmarks. It holds the esteemed title of being the birthplace of democracy and the cradle of European civilization.
Athens is also home to the Acropolis, which represents the earliest form of a modern society in Europe. One of the highlights of our Athens visit was our tour of the Acropolis.
Contrary to common misconception, the term ‘Acropolis’ does not specifically denote the temple situated atop the hill. Instead, it encompasses the entire hill, with the well-known temple at its summit being the…

People are always surprised when I say that I live in Greece. To tell the truth I have never imagined that I was going to live here… and neither when I initially came to spend 3 months was I planning to stay for that long. Three years and a half have passed and here I am. Before getting to know Athens and Greece I didn’t have an image in my mind of what I was going to find here, and in different ways and little by little the city and the country have conquered me. Today I can say much more than 10 reasons to live here, but I will just give you a taste.
1-Weather
Greece is in fact a blessed country for the weather that it has. The only thing that I would change would be to add some humidity in the air, since sometimes it is so dry that it causes irritations. Other than that, the seasons are very well defined and never reach extremes. Of course in the North it is more cold during the winter, and in mountainous areas. In Athens, the winter hardly has temperatures below zero, normally it is between 10 and 20 degrees until April, May, and then it starts to rise. It snows mostly three times during the winter, and normally it does not accumulate on the ground. During summer, the temperature can reach more than 35 degrees, especially in July and August. My favorite seasons are spring and fall, both with pleasant temperatures, although during fall it rains a bit more. Still, in general it rains quite little in Athens (in the summer we spend three months with the sun shining intensively).
2-Islands
Who has never dreamed of visiting the famous Greek islands? Or spending the honeymoon around here? As a matter of fact, the islands are one of the most incredible reasons to live in this country. And Athens is in advantage because it has the biggest ports and it is quite close from some of these paradises. It is very curious to talk about trips with Greeks, although many of them have never visited some of their neighbor countries, every summer they go to two or three different islands and they love to talk about what each one has that is special, and to compare them. In three years, I could already know some of these enchanting places, and each year choosing becomes more difficult, as the more you listen about the places, the more you want to visit them.
3-Safety
Ok, Greece is no Denmark, and organization is not Greek’s favorite word, neither it is law. But one thing that is very respected around here, is the space and freedom of each individual. Theft is common, as also in every other corner in Europe, but here we can walk the streets at dawn without worrying if we will manage to come back home safely. Athens, being a big city and with more than three million inhabitants, might not be the best example in safety of the country, nevertheless it is rare to hear about murders or general violence against people in the streets, and even the protests during the crisis are somehow pacific.
4-Food
Unmissable! Just with this word you can have an idea of the Greek cuisine. In the last three years I have gained some kilos (and I don’t complain because I was skinny before), something that in 25 years of life I have never achieved, regardless the place I was living. Yes, the food is delicious, and there is great variety. In Athens, besides thousands of taverns, you can find Mexican restaurants, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Russian and so on. From Greek food, features the olive oil, the olives, feta cheese and the famous souvlaki (the Greek acarajé, as I usually compare, with this delicious dish from Bahia).
5-Nightlife
Again the weather here helps a lot. There is nothing like a bad winter that makes the Greeks stay at home instead of enjoying the night. Either for dinner (normally after 9pm) or drinks at some bar, or a club, the Greek nightlife is very exciting. Athens has different neighborhoods that concentrate these clubs for different tastes, and the best thing is that it costs nothing to enter these parties. You only pay what you drink. For the typical Greek clubs, the parties called buzukia, you pay a more expensive entrance, but it includes food and drinks. And the night never ends, you only come back before 3am if you want to.
6-People similar to Brazilians
Greeks are very different from the typical European from the North. Besides being Mediterranean, they have mixed up with Turkish, and this mix has given origin to a joyful and lively people. They love gathering to eat and talk, spending hours sitting at the table after a meal. Besides that, normally they are friendly with strangers, maybe in Athens a bit less since it is a big city. They are also passionate about music and arts in general. The only thing that I miss about the joyful Greek life style is the dance. They don’t do it like Brazilians. Although they get excited with the typical Greek dance, they are usually not moving so much at parties and clubs.
7-Peaceful life
Even though Athens is the capital of the country, it has this air of a small town. Despite having great movement and quite a hectic nightlife, busier than other European capitals, you can easily find quiet neighborhoods in the suburban areas, like small villages. Having an older population contributes a lot to that.
8-Prices and courtesies
Greece is not a cheap country, but comparing to others in Europe the cost of life is interesting. You can buy a bottle of water with less than 50 cents of Euro. And to have a nice meal here can cost between 5 and 10 euros. Besides, it is very common at restaurants to offer free water and sometimes free dessert. Apartment rentals are also cheap comparing to capitals like Paris, and even cities in Brazil, like São Paulo and Rio, and, in general, there are not big social differences. I know, for instance, people working as maid at hotels and living in a very good apartment in a noble area of the city.
9-Cafes
Athens has cafes in every corner of the city. And it is a Greek habit to go out to have coffee and chill at any moment of the day. Their happy hour is much more connected to coffee than to beer as in Brazil. OK, to me, since I am not a big fan of coffee this could be a disadvantage somehow, but most Brazilians would certainly enjoy this routine a lot.
10-Culture/History
Who does not know that Greece is one of the richest countries historically and culturally speaking and that a lot of what we inherited as western civilization come from here? Even words from Portuguese have origin in the Greek language, and they are a lot! It is amazing to go around Athens and to visit the ruins and monuments, and at any place that you go to visit in the country, you will certainly find a piece of this history.

“Let there be light! Said Liberty, And like sunrise from the sea, Athens arose!” — Percy Bysshe Shelley
During our recent vacation in Athens in March 2023, my family and I made the decision to explore the charming pedestrianized streets that wind through the heart of the city.
Recognizing the golden chance it presented, I seized the moment to craft a photo essay destined to be shared with my dear readers.
A visit to Athens is essential to experience Greece fully, as it is regarded as one of Europe’s most iconic destinations. Often called the cradle of civilization, Athens showcases the rich history of Ancient Greece, highlighted by the magnificent Acropolis that dominates the city’s skyline.
Athens, renowned as the epicenter of the ancient world, offers present-day visitors an incredibly authentic and memorable glimpse into life from nearly…

Hello there! My name is Nick Iakovidis and I live in Athens, since I was a baby. I would like to take you on a trip to my home like no other will ever take you! I’ll share with you the secrets of my city, that gave birth to Socrates and Plato, and guide you through her streets. So, prepare yourselves for a great adventure and walk with me in one of the oldest cities in Europe!
We start with the most famous neighborhood of Athens, Monastiraki.
Monastiraki is the heart of Athens. You can reach it either by bus, train or metro, so it is pretty easy to get there without getting lost. Once out of the train station, you will reach the “Monastiraki Square” which you can see in the photo below. It is always filled with people, locals, street artists, and tourists from every place on earth.
See that church in the left corner? This is the church of “Panagia Pantanassa” (“Mother Mary — Queen of the World”). It may seem insignificant, but it is in fact one of the oldest churches in Athens, built around the 10th century AD! It was originally part of a much larger monastery, which covered the entire square. When the monastery was destroyed during the 19th century, the church became known as “little Monastery” or “Monastiraki” in Greek, thus giving its name to the neighborhood! Look closely at its corners and you will spot parts of ancient Greek pillars, which were used for its building, proving how old it really is!
While the train station is a common meeting point with our friends, family, or dates, the locals don’t like spending much time here. There are plenty of routes to choose from and wander into the streets! Also, I would like to advise you not to fall into temptation and sit in one of the many roof gardens like “360"", “MS Roof Garden”, “Anglais”, and “Citizen”, neither have souvlaki at the restaurants found in Mitropoleos street, near the square! These places are tourist traps and overcharge everything.
Instead, take the Ifaistou street and go on a trip to the Flea Market of Athens, also known as “Yusurum”. Originally created by Jewish immigrants in 1863, this market is where you can find anything you ever wanted. Vinyls and CDs at “Zacharias”, rock, punk, and heavy metal accessories at “Full Moon”, leather sandals and silly t-shirts, lots of hippie clothes, cannabis products, and souvenirs. Whether you want to buy a mini-Parthenon or a cool-looking set of leather boots, this place will get you covered.
But if you want to dig really deep while in there, and find valuable treasures, unlike anything else, you need to go to “Abyssinia Square”, located at the end of Ifaistou. Named after the Africans from Ethiopia, who settled there during the Ottoman occupation, it is where numerous antique shops are located. Here you will find comic books, posters, memorabilia, collectibles, rings, and telephones, all coming from decades ago! Here, laying on wooden tables in front view you may find things like broken clocks, old musical instruments, even valuable coins from 100 years ago! It is the perfect place to find a unique gift to take back!
Extra tip: every Sunday there is a bazaar of antiques here, so don’t miss it!
Are you tired from your trip and need a drink?
Then spend your time in one of the many bars, hiding around the Flea Market! Unlike those found in the central square, here you will have a great time, enjoying your drink like a true Athenian!
Need a place where you can marvel at the Parthenon while drinking your favorite cocktail or coffee? Then, allow me to introduce you to “Couleur Locale”, or as it is known here, “one of the most beautiful terraces of the city”:
Beautiful, isn’t it? “Locale” opened in 2014 and since then, it has become a favorite place for university students to party. Be sure to check out its signature cocktails like “Gin Basil Smash”, “The Surfer” and “Sleep no More”, made with gin and unique Greek flavors, like mastic, basil, and lemon. So, take your friends and go have the party of your lives under the attic night sky!
Perhaps you prefer a more quiet approach! Like a small green garden inside an old neoclassical house! Well, then say no more, and knock on the wooden door of the building right next to “Locale”. Don’t be afraid, it is not abandoned! It is just camouflage!
This is “Taff: the Art Foundation”:
Yes, this is real. Yes, it is in Monastiraki, hidden in plain sight.
TAF opened its doors to the public in May 2009 and since then it remains one of the most active and creative organizations in the city. It hosts a variety of cultural events, like concerts, galleries, and art exhibitions, all made by local artists. If you seek an artistic, bohemian paradise, right in the heart of Athens, you’ve found it!
Still, want more?
Then, take out your phone and prepare to update your Instagram! It’s time to visit the most instagramable cafe in Monastiraki!
This is “Ellyz Cafe”
“Ellyz” resembles more a pink paradise, straight out from a Disney movie, rather than an actual place. Once inside, you will find yourself enjoying your brunch on a cozy couch, while hundreds of flowers are hanging over your head. Its menu could make even Willy Wonka himself green from envy! Try chocolate pink hearts, creamy lemon tarts with flowers, and tasty rose cheesecake, which will melt in your mouth! Coffee lovers don’t forget to try a pink cappucino or a fredo latte with a large pink donut on top!
Extra tip: make sure you go to Ellyz with a friend who knows to take great photos!
Of course, Monastiraki is a multicultural neighborhood. Besides the above cafes and bars, you will find exotic places to travel you in faraway lands. Don’t miss to check out “James Joyce Irish Pub” (which is a personal favorite) and enjoy a Guinness with juicy chicken wings, while watching sports on one of the many tv screens. Or how about a visit to exotic Cuba? Seek the “Buena Vista Social Bar” and have a Latin party on its vintage decorated terrace!
It is time to share with you one final secret. Go to the end of Adrianou Street and start walking towards the centrer. In front of you, you will see one of my favorite spots in Monastiraki. On your right lies the ancient Agora of Athens, covered in a green dress of trees and bushes. You might spot the temple of Ifaistos and the Stoa of Attalos, graciously standing above all the others. Perhaps you might hear the sound of trains arriving at the station.
On your left there are the numerous cafes and restaurants of Adrianou, always filled with people. You will see elders reading their newspapers while drinking ouzo, tourists laughing and carrying their luggage, children loudly playing on the street next to people, who are selling antiques. A young couple might pass next to you, enjoying ice cream while holding hands, or a company of college students, eager to plan their night party at one of the bars mentioned above. You will hear Greek, Russian, and English, all mixed together in multicultural harmony. Perhaps, if you are lucky enough, you will feel the light summer breeze of Athens cooling your face, as the sun makes its way down to the West.
This is Athens. This is Monastiraki!
A Crossroads of Civilizations!

If real estate developers from 2500 years ago could time travel to present-day Athens, they’d likely nod knowingly at the Acropolis and say, “Location, location, location,” before immediately filing permits to build luxury condos with “authentic Parthenon views.” Perched 150 meters above sea level, the Acropolis stands as humanity’s most enduring architectural humblebrag — the ancient equivalent of posting a vacation selfie with the caption “just a casual Tuesday #blessed.”
This wasn’t just any construction project — it was ancient Athens announcing to the Mediterranean world: We’ve got surplus wealth, artistic genius, and we’re not afraid to use it. Also, Sparta, are you taking notes?
What began as a practical hilltop fortress evolved into Western civilization’s most iconic symbol of democracy and architectural achievement. The limestone outcropping that once protected Athenians from invaders now protects something else entirely: our collective cultural memory of a time when a small city-state pioneered ideas that would fundamentally alter human history — all while setting the record for world’s longest-running construction project.
The Rocky Rise to Fame: A Brief History
The Acropolis’s story begins long before Pericles decided to give it a fancy makeover. Archaeological evidence shows human occupation dating back to the Neolithic era (around 4000–3000 BCE), when our ancestors apparently shared the same appreciation for defensible real estate with good views as modern luxury condo developers.
The Persian invasion of 480 BCE brought a dramatic plot twist. When King Xerxes and his forces captured Athens, they razed the buildings on the Acropolis, providing Athens with what modern architects might call “an unfortunate but clean slate for urban renewal.” The Athenians, after defeating the Persians at Salamis, left the ruins as a memorial to Persian aggression, perhaps history’s first example of politically motivated construction delays.
The Acropolis as we know it emerged during Athens’ Golden Age under Pericles (495–429 BCE), the influential statesman who spearheaded an ambitious building program funded by the treasury of the Delian League — essentially repurposing defense funds for infrastructure projects. When allied city-states complained about their defense contributions being used to beautify Athens, Pericles essentially responded with the ancient Greek equivalent of “What are you going to do about it?” This massive urban renewal project employed thousands of artisans and laborers — basically the New Deal with more nude statues.
The Acropolis: A Not-So-Brief Timeline
Architectural Marvels: The Buildings That Changed History
The crown jewel of the Acropolis is undoubtedly the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Athena Parthenos (“Athena the Virgin”). Completed around 438 BCE, the Parthenon embodies perfection through imperfection. Its architects built subtle curves into seemingly straight lines and tilted supposedly vertical columns inward — optical illusions designed to make the structure appear perfectly straight. Think of it as ancient Photoshop: reality enhancement before filters existed.
The Parthenon’s dimensions follow a precise mathematical ratio, with its 46 outer columns assembled with such precision that many joints remain water-tight after 2,500 years — which makes you wonder what these builders would think about your contractor’s excuses.
Next door stands the Erechtheion with its famous Porch of the Caryatids: six sculpted maiden columns who’ve been holding up that roof for twenty-five centuries without a coffee break or basic labor protections. These ladies represent history’s longest-standing case of unpaid female labor, though today five are replicas, with the originals safely housed in the Acropolis Museum (except for one “recruited” by Lord Elgin who now resides in the British Museum — an international custody battle that continues to this day).
The Propylaea, the monumental gateway designed by architect Mnesicles, remains one of history’s most impressive entrance halls — though modern visitors experience it more like an ancient Greek subway station during rush hour. Its innovative design included Doric columns (the simpler style) on the outside and Ionic columns (the fancier ones with scroll-like details) on the inside, a mixed architectural order that was revolutionary for its time.
Gods, Myths, and Drama: The Cultural Significance
The Acropolis wasn’t just a collection of pretty buildings, it was ancient Athens’ spiritual and cultural heart. According to myth, the site was where Athena and Poseidon competed to become the city’s patron deity in what was essentially the ancient world’s most high-stakes talent show. Poseidon struck the rock with his trident, producing a salt spring (essentially the divine equivalent of giving someone bottled water when they already live next to a freshwater lake). Athena countered by gifting an olive tree, offering food, oil, and wood. The Athenians chose Athena’s offering, demonstrating that even in mythology, economic benefits trump special effects.
The olive tree remained central to Athenian economy and religion, with the sacred olive oil from trees descended from Athena’s gift used as prizes in the Panathenaic Games — ancient Greece’s version of the Olympics, but with more olive oil and fewer corporate sponsors.
The Acropolis witnessed Athens’ greatest triumphs and darkest moments. When Christianity replaced ancient Greek religion, the Parthenon became a church. Under Ottoman rule, it became a mosque — making it perhaps history’s most overqualified religious building. In 1687, the Venetians bombarded the Acropolis, igniting ammunition stored inside the Parthenon and causing catastrophic damage — proving that using world heritage sites as military installations is never a good idea.
The most controversial chapter began in 1801 when Lord Elgin removed sculptures from the Parthenon — proving that with the right paperwork, even institutionalized looting can be made perfectly legal. These “Elgin Marbles” now reside in the British Museum, with Greek requests for their return continuing and Britain’s finder’s keepers position becoming increasingly awkward in an era of cultural repatriation.
Visiting Today: Tips and Reflections
If you visit the Acropolis today, you’ll join approximately 3 million annual visitors in a pilgrimage that’s equal parts awe-inspiring and sweat-inducing. Here’s what to expect:
Despite the crowds and occasional scaffolding of ongoing restoration work (which has been ongoing since approximately forever), standing on the Acropolis remains a profound experience. You’re treading the same marble as Socrates, Pericles, and countless anonymous Athenians who shaped Western thought, though they probably weren’t wearing Crocs or complaining about Wi-Fi connectivity.
The Acropolis’s greatest lesson might be how it connects us across time. The ancient Athenians grappled with questions of governance, justice, and truth that we still haven’t fully resolved. As you descend from Athens’ sacred hill, you carry with you a tangible connection to the birthplace of concepts that shape our world today.
Plus, you’ve earned the right to say “when I was at the Acropolis…” at dinner parties for at least the next decade — which might be the most enduring legacy of all.

Athen’s Agora was the center of public life in ancient Athens, surrounded by impressive temples and government buildings. It served as a gathering place for citizens to discuss politics and trade goods. Notable structures included the Stoa of Attalos, a covered walkway lined with shops, and the Temple of Hephaestus, which has come down to us as one of the best-preserved temples from ancient Greece.
“Wow, this place is a lot,” I remarked to my husband an hour into our explorations. “Everything we have ever learned about ancient Greece originates from here. This is the epicenter of the Western world.”
The archaeological site was remarkably green, clean, and well-maintained, unlike almost everywhere else in Athens.
“Dude, could you imagine if all these buildings were tagged?” I mused.
Ryan took a good look around and replied, “I almost can’t believe they’re not.”
“In all honesty, they almost should be, as a symbol of how far democracy has fallen,” I said, unaware of how much farther it still had to plummet.
When we were there in 2018, I still believed in democracy. However, as I write this, I’m not so sure I do anymore. The thought of America turning into an oligarchy wasn’t even on my radar back then. What was Elon Musk even doing in 2018? Sure, he was the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, and he was making headlines for selling flamethrowers and trying to rescue some trapped Thai kids in a cave. But the idea of him overthrowing the U.S. government and acting as its president seemed highly unlikely. Why would a billionaire even do that? And if one did, it certainly wouldn’t happen in America, the home of the so-called leader of the free world. Fast forward seven years, and now I believe democracy is a dying institution.
Although we do not practice democracy in its purest form today, even ancient Greece encountered similar challenges and sometimes fell into oligarchy. The term “democracy” literally means “people power,” and one of the most notable features of their system was the absence of political parties. I salivate just imagining a system where voting was based solely on majority rule, without an electoral college to alter the final results.
I used to believe in voting, as well, but that, too, is something I now question. However, it’s more accurate to say that I don’t trust any politicians — not a single one of them. No one I voted for is standing up against the looming oligarchy because they are part of it. They realized there was no point in pretending anymore.
Where there’s power, there’s corruption. I’ve come to realize that democracy is no different from communism — it looks good on paper. The realities of political maneuvering, social inequality, and the influence of money often contrast sharply with democratic ideals. Therefore, while democracy is often celebrated as a preferable system of governance, it still has the potential to fail. And when democracy falters, it can bring an entire country down with it.
The Temple of Hephaestus loomed over Athens’ Agora on a hill not far in the distance. The temple was originally dedicated to the Greek god of artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, metallurgy, fire, and volcanoes — more commonly known as Vulcan in Roman mythology. Visitors are not allowed inside; even in ancient times, ordinary people could not enter the inner sanctum — only priests had that privilege. The interior featured a large statue of the deity, which could be seen from outside when the temple doors were open, allowing the gods to “see” the rituals performed in front of the building.
It’s my theory that democracy has shut itself away inside this temple. Whenever the temple doors are opened, democracy remains a deity that citizens can only gaze upon and worship from a distance.
My books Memory Road Trip (e-book or paperback) and Time Traveled (e-book or paperback) are both available! You can also find them at most major international book sites.

Athens — a city where time stands still, yet everything pulses with life. It’s here that my journey as a techno nomad begins, a place where ancient history intertwines with modern chaos, and where every corner seems to whisper stories of the past. I spent a week in this vibrant city, absorbing its energy and allowing it to shape the beats of my first track Upon arriving, I was immediately drawn to the Acropolis, the iconic heart of Athens. Standing beneath the towering Parthenon, I could feel the weight of history, the echoes of ancient civilizations in the air. The Acropolis, perched high above the city, offered a panoramic view of Athens, a sprawling metropolis that felt eternal. Each stone seemed to hum with energy, and I could already sense the beginnings of a deep, resonant bassline forming in my mind. The contrast between the sacred ruins and the bustling city below gave me the idea for the track’s foundation — slow, powerful beats that rise and fall like the ancient columns around me.
But my exploration didn’t end there. I ventured to Pnyx Hill, a site where the seeds of democracy were sown. Standing where Athenian citizens once gathered to debate and decide the future of their city, I felt the collective power of history. The energy here was quieter, but no less potent — like a steady, rhythmic pulse beneath the surface. This inspired the more subtle, driving melodies in the track, layers that build tension and momentum as they progress.
Athens, however, isn’t just a city of the past. Its modern side is equally captivating, and nowhere was that more apparent than in the anarchic neighborhood of Exarchia. This part of the city is raw, rebellious, and alive with creative energy. Graffiti-covered walls, political posters, and street art filled the streets, while the hum of life and resistance was palpable. The urban chaos here felt like an assault on the senses — in the best way possible. It was this part of Athens that brought a gritty, industrial edge to the track, a distorted synth that mirrors the frenetic energy of the city’s underground.
As I continued to explore, I sought balance in quieter, more spiritual places. The Temple of Hephaistos, nestled in the ancient Agora, offered a peaceful respite. Here, among the columns of the temple, I found the space to breathe, to reflect, and to listen to the quieter tones of the city. This serenity inspired the atmospheric breaks in the track, moments of pause between the intensity, allowing the listener to absorb the depth of the soundscape.
Evenings were spent along the coast of Palaio Faliro, where the waves gently lapped against the shore. The calming rhythm of the sea gave the track its final touch — a hypnotic groove that carries the listener forward, like the endless ebb and flow of the ocean. This final element tied everything together, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is peace.
After a week in Athens, I had completed my first track — an aural reflection of the city’s soul. It’s a blend of ancient and modern, of chaotic energy and quiet reflection, much like Athens itself. This journey through history, rebellion, and tranquility has set the tone for what’s to come. Athens, with all its layers and contrasts, gave me the foundation for a sound that’s deeply rooted in place, yet entirely my own.
As I prepare for my next stop — Berlin — I carry with me the lessons and sounds of Athens. This city has shown me how to balance history and modernity, chaos and calm, and weave them into a track that captures the spirit of a place. Stay tuned for the next chapter in this sonic journey as I dive into the heart of techno in Berlin.

“Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts and eloquence.” — John Milton
As our plane flew above Athens on our family’s first trip to Greece, the limited view from above only added to the excitement and wonder we were feeling.
As we looked out the window, we were able to see glimpses of the city’s charm. Clusters of rooftops gave us a peek into the vibrant neighborhoods below.
Although we couldn’t see all the finer details, the thrill of being above Athens, surrounded by its rich history and lively culture, only heightened our eagerness to explore the city in person.

“It takes a lifetime to discover Greece, but it only takes an instant to fall in love with her.” — Henry Miller
Starting my unforgettable journey through Greece, I’m excited to finally check it off my bucket list while diving into its stunning beauty and fascinating history.
Thanks to my travel agent’s help, who carefully put together a package including visits to Athens, Santorini, and Crete, along with accommodations and airport transfers, all I needed to do was book a flight.
I started my journey in Athens, a city that effortlessly blends ancient history with modern culture. As I walked through the streets of Plaka, I was captivated by the combination of ancient ruins and bustling cafes, which revealed the city’s rich history and culture at every corner.
During my stay in Athens, I visited the Parthenon atop the Acropolis, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. Standing beneath the ancient temple, I was awestruck by the sheer scale of its history and significance. The Parthenon’s towering columns and intricate carvings are a true testament to the brilliance and craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks.
To fully immerse myself in Athenian life, I chose to stay in the heart of downtown Athens. This allowed me to walk everywhere, making it easy to explore landmarks such as Syntagma Square, Monastiraki Flea Market, and the vibrant neighborhoods of Psiri and Exarchia. Being centrally located made me feel part of the city’s pulse, and I enjoyed soaking up the vibrant atmosphere that surrounded me.
“I want to have an ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ experience where I drop off the face of the planet and move to Greece.” — Jennifer Hyman
My journey then led me to Santorini, a destination that had long captured my imagination. As the ferry approached the island, I was greeted by a breathtaking panorama of white-washed buildings clinging to cliffs, adorned with blue-domed churches. The striking contrast between the pristine whitewashed architecture and the deep azure of the Aegean Sea was truly mesmerizing, creating a scene straight out of a postcard.
Exploring Enchanting Villages:
Stepping onto Santorini’s shores felt like entering a dream. I embarked on a journey to explore its enchanting villages, starting with the iconic Oia. Its narrow cobblestone streets led me on a whimsical journey, lined with charming cafes, boutique shops, and art galleries tucked away in every nook and cranny. The village’s crowning glory, however, was its unparalleled sunset views. Joining fellow travelers atop the cliffs of Oia, I witnessed nature’s masterpiece unfold as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of gold and crimson.
Continuing my exploration, I ventured to Fira, Santorini’s bustling capital perched atop the caldera cliffs. Here, I found a vibrant atmosphere pulsating through its labyrinthine streets. From chic boutiques to traditional tavernas, Fira offered a delightful blend of modernity and tradition. And no visit to Fira would be complete without a stroll along the cliffside promenade, where panoramic views of the caldera stretched out before me, offering a glimpse into the island’s volcanic past.
Embracing the Island’s Natural Beauty:
Santorini’s allure extends beyond its picturesque villages, beckoning travelers to immerse themselves in its natural wonders. I embarked on a trek along the caldera rim, traversing rugged terrain and ancient pathways carved into the cliffs. With each step, I was rewarded with sweeping vistas of the Aegean Sea and the neighboring islands, a reminder of the island’s volcanic origins.
Moreover, Santorini’s beaches are not to be missed. From the black sands of Perissa and Kamari to the red sands of Red Beach, each shoreline offered its own unique charm. I spent my days lounging on the sun-drenched shores, taking refreshing dips in the crystalline waters, and soaking in the Mediterranean sun.
A Word of Advice: Bring Comfortable Walking Shoes:
As I navigated Santorini’s enchanting landscapes, one thing became abundantly clear: comfortable walking shoes are an absolute must. Whether exploring the winding streets of its villages or trekking along the rugged coastline, sturdy footwear ensured that I could fully enjoy all that Santorini had to offer without any discomfort.
Finally, I set sail for Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, and a place of myth and legend. Exploring the Palace of Knossos, I felt like I was walking in the footsteps of ancient kings and heroes, with the echoes of the past reverberating through the labyrinthine ruins. I also took the time to unwind on Crete’s beautiful beaches with their crystal-clear waters and golden sands, which offered the perfect respite after days filled with exploration and discovery.
In conclusion, my Greek odyssey exceeded my wildest expectations, offering a tapestry of experiences that will remain in my memory for years to come. I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced Greece’s natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant culture. I know that Greece will always hold a special place in my heart, beckoning me back to its shores time and time again.

Entry 150. Athens, GreeceThursday, April 20
After some seriously rocky adventures on Kefalonia, I was kind of looking forward to heading back to big-city civilisation. The Greek islands have great potential but they can be quite hard work, especially so if you visit outside of high season.
To be honest I felt the least welcome of any place on my travels whilst being in these islands because of grumpy locals, over-priced food and accommodation, difficulty in getting places and the slapstick level of service.
Maybe it’s a Greek thing, maybe it’s just that they’re sick of tourists because we’ve been coming here for thousands of years. Whatever. All that has resulted in collective fatigue which means I’m in less than an optimum condition to write this entry about Athens, which needs to cover many weird, wonderful and important things. I hope I do it justice, so please bear with me.

This is the 5th article in the series — a collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB). Previous articles mapped property ownership-related patterns in Copenhagen, Prague, and Lisbon. In this post, we turn our attention to Athens, identifying parallels with Lisbon in how the city’s land management, ownership and built environment patterns were shaped in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
Like Lisbon, Athens together with its greater public interest have been significantly impacted by the Troika loan conditions, weak regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable groups, and a lack of data transparency in land and property ownership registers, although this is now being addressed through efforts to digitise the national cadaster.
This blog supports the argument that municipalities and state governments, just as the large developers and investment companies, play an active role in neoliberal city and country development logics leading to privatisation and financialization of the public real estate assets. It also argues that the European city and national governments should play a much stronger role in promoting spatial justice and societal resilience through land management rather than using it as a mere tool for profit and public debt repayment.
Athens has become the second least liveable city in Europe, according to a recent report “On the quality of life in European cities, 2023”, published by the European Commission. The reasons are similar to the issues and patterns observed in Lisbon, which largely resulted in the increasing unaffordability and ever-increasing spatial exclusion of its citizens.
Acquiring, analysing and visualising data on land ownership can be a powerful tool in comprehending the past, and current built environment justice patterns and their socio-spatial intricacies. In Athens, due to a lack of data access and transparency, despite numerous efforts, it has been challenging to precisely assess and depict who owns land and property in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions that could bring actors in power into the public eye.
We have therefore taken a desk research approach to finding data on major landowners and significant land sales conducted in the past decade, contextualising them within Athens’ housing landscape and reflecting on their relationship with the city’s future transition strategies.
The blog is therefore structured as follows:
A) Largest landowners
B) Major Land Sales
C) Forces at Play
B) Athens’ housing issues
D) Data transparency review — National Property Registry
E) Concluding reflections — Future city transition

2. Athens Municipality: The city of Athens itself owns a large portion of public spaces, including parks, squares, infrastructural land and municipal buildings (Athens Social Atlas)
3. Greek Orthodox Church: Holds substantial real estate, including historic churches, monasteries, and other religious properties, as well as land that has been bequeathed to the Church over centuries. (See: Reuters, Athens Social Atlas)
2. Foreign Investment Funds: Over the past two decades, several international investment funds have purchased property in Athens, to capitalise on the low real estate prices that followed the financial crisis. This includes hedge funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have acquired properties, especially in tourist-heavy areas or neighbourhoods undergoing redevelopment.
In the past decade, Athens has seen several major land sales as part of a broader wave of real estate activity, subsequent privatisation efforts, and international interest in Greece. Below are some of the most significant land sales based on land size and estimated market value, taking into account location (prime or less-developed areas), demand (tourism, logistics, residential), and strategic importance (e.g., port facilities, large urban developments).
Hellinikon Project (former Athens Airport)
Astir Palace Resort (Vouliagmeni Peninsula)
Piraeus Port Authority (PPA)
Marina Zea (Piraeus)
The sale of public land in Greece, facilitated by the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), has been a major source of societal outcry, particularly in the wake of the country’s sovereign debt crisis (2009–2010).
As part of the bailout agreements imposed by the Troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), Greece was pressured to privatise public land and assets, a move critics argue significantly weakened the state both politically and economically. This privatisation agenda, which often disregarded national social needs, was aimed at settling debt by selling off strategic assets such as airports, ports, and vast tracts of land. Projects like the Hellinikon redevelopment, where public land is being transformed into private luxury developments, have marginalised lower-income residents and reduced public access to urban and coastal areas. Local communities, environmental organisations, and political opposition have strongly resisted these sales, especially of large coastal sites like Ellinikon, which includes the former Athens airport and Agios Kosmas beach, arguing that the privatisations prioritise elite interests over broader public needs.
Politically, the HRADF’s operations have been highly controversial, with opponents dubbing it the “Sell-out Fund of Greece” and questioning the constitutionality of its mandate. Additionally, the low sale prices of assets, such as Lamda Development’s acquisition of Hellinikon for a fraction of its real value, have intensified public resentment, with many viewing these transactions as a fire sale of national treasures.
As noted in the Athens Social Atlas article, the privatisation programme fits into a long history of public land abuse and illegal seizures. This includes everything from individuals and companies encroaching on public land for private purposes to large-scale speculative developments by private enterprises. What is more, in some cases, this also relates to the opposite scenarios when privately owned land has been taken over by the state. The absence of a transparent National Land Registry, coupled with a fragmented bureaucracy, has facilitated large-scale exploitation and commodification of public assets.
The great article from Athens Social Atlas (2015), by renowned scholar and economic geographer Costis Hadjimichalis summarises some of the dynamics that shape the land seizures in Attica. He also writes that:
“The main reason for land-related abuses and illegal activities, but also for the delays in privatisation and sell-off by the HRADF, is the lack of a National Land Register. Essentially, due to a variety of factors, the state is not fully aware of the actual size and location of its real estate assets. Other than the lack of a land register, other important factors are the fragmentation of public services dealing with public land, the weakness or indifference of civil servants and the combination of political expedience and corruption.”
The recent development of a national land register provides some hope for a more informed and democratic decision process in terms of land management. However, while HRADF records its most profitable year, the rhetoric remains the same: “With a record contribution to the public funds as well as to the development course of the country, it seems that the operation of the TAIPED will be completed, and by the end of the year it will be absorbed by the Superfund” and “In total, the revenue from concessions — privatisations this year — will, for the first time in the history of the Fund — exceed 4 billion euros , an amount that will be automatically directed to the repayment of a not inconsiderable part of the public debt, contributing to its reduction by almost two percentage points of GDP“. This year alone, Greece hopes to raise more than 5 billion euros in 2024 from the sale of state assets, including a stake in Athens International Airport and concession deals for two toll roads, a senior privatisation official said on Wednesday — the privatisation logic continues. What has changed are add-ons such as “Decarbonisation Fund” and ESG compliance, with the support of the largest consulting firms.
To understand some of the further reasons behind the present spatial injustice issues in the Athens Metropolitan Area, one has to further examine the forces that came into play, prior to and following the financial crisis, as well as the enabling policies and regulatory mechanisms that facilitated their enforcement. These include:
Sources: (Law 2778/1999), (Law 4646/2019), (Law 4714/2020 — Article 5B), Law 4242/2014, Laws 4242/2014 and 4373/2016), (Law 5006/2022),
1. Housing financialisation a la Griega” — Alexandri, 2022
2. Social justice and a city: surplus capital and the remaking of Athens
3. Housing Crisis and Neoliberal Social policy in Greece
4. “​Platform — driven housing commodification, financialisation and gentrification in Athens
The dynamics described above led to multiple urban socio-spatial problems. Eteron — the Institute for Research and Social Change — a non-profit organisation working towards the production of knowledge and citizen empowerment through its
Project Housing360
provides an impactful overview of the present housing problems in Greece.
Property ownership in Greece is fragmented and often difficult to track accurately. This is partly due to incomplete land records and inheritance processes, outdated property registries, and legal complexity. The creation of a comprehensive, unified land registry system, the National Property Registry, also known as ‘Ktimatologio’, has been a laborious process spanning over three decades.
Before the establishment of the Ktimatologio, property records were managed by ‘Ypothikofylakeia’ (Mortgage Registries), which were responsible for recording legal documents related to property transactions, such as mortgages, deeds, and other encumbrances. As the Ktimatologio gradually expands, it is replacing the Ypothikofylakeia. In areas where the Ktimatologio is fully operational, the Ypothikofylakeio is either phased out or its role is significantly reduced. However, in areas where the Ktimatologio is not yet implemented, the Ypothikofylakeio continues to function as the primary land registry. Presently, the Greek government expresses optimism regarding the Ktimatologio project’s culmination by the year 2026.
An interactive digital map, with all properties currently incorporated into the registry, has been recently released, accompanied by the number for each plot. In adherence to data protection protocols, under both national law and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ownership details will remain undisclosed within the map.
To uncover ownership information, Greek Law permits anyone invoking “legitimate interest” to apply for information held in the land registry, which is provided by the Land Registrar in the form of a certificate or excerpt of the Land Book” (ELRA) — therefore the information can be considered public in the sense that anyone can have access to it. Each property is marked with a unique number, the so-called Code Number E of the national K thematic catalogue (KAEK), which is the exclusive code number for each parcel of land, the identity of the property. The interactive digital map represents the first time that each plot’s code is publicly available. One can purchase different types of information upon registration through a Greek digital system Taxisnet for residents with Tax registration number.
As this is a work in progress, property holders are still having the liberty to register their properties and update information conveniently, eliminating the need for physical visits to government agencies with supporting documentation. Though the deadline for property registration has lapsed, the online map aims to serve as an incentive for registration, ideally before November 30th, 2024.
After analysing Copenhagen, Prague, Lisbon, and Athens, it is clear that European States have followed certain common patterns in land management and real estate development. The role of the state and municipalities, often perceived as passive guardians of public interests against large private investors, has shifted towards active promoters of privatisation. Publicly owned development companies, such as Copenhagen’s City and Port Corporation or Greece’s TAIPED (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund), are increasingly used to stimulate economic growth and repay debt — whether infrastructure-related as in Copenhagen or tied to Greece’s financial crisis.
This system inherently incentivises the maximisation of returns on investments, often through the sale and development of public land into high-value, luxury projects. This approach prioritises short-term financial gains and large-scale developments, with little room for smaller, complex, or low-return projects, such as providing or retrofitting affordable housing.
While balance sheets may look strong, with institutions like HRADF showing greater financial returns, the reality is that profits are privatised, while the risks and losses are borne by society at large.
This raises the questions:

In the heart of Pangrati, I found myself surrendering to the most unlikely companions: the yiayias and their trusty shopping carts.
It was a tale not of streets but of wheels, where the clatter of metal on cobblestone became my guide through the labyrinthine charm of Athens. Each yiayia, with her cart in tow, was a living, breathing cartographer, mapping out the intricate routes to the neighborhood’s most popular pop-up.
I ditched the digital predictability of Google Maps and became an unwitting disciple of these cart-wielding mavens.
The market, when finally unveiled, was a testament to the wisdom of following the clatter and the charm of navigating life with a shopping cart as a trusted sidekick. The cart wasn’t just a means of transport; it was a companion, a confidant, and a symbol of gastronomic acumen. The locals, weathered and wise, shared amused glances as I, the outsider, fell in step with the cart procession.
In the gritty underbelly of Athens, the local market is a sensory onslaught. As you navigate through weathered…

Athens, Greece, January, 3rd 2023.
Yesterday, as a deceptively serene January sun shone on one of those poorly built streets of Athens, most likely hastily rebuilt after an earthquake, I found myself walking from the Acropolis to my hotel to interview Marlena for my podcast Stories of Healing.
On a side street of the bustling city, a man was standing on the sidewalk while another attempted to inject drugs directly into one of his neck’s arteries with a syringe. This unexpected encounter hit me hard. The compassionate teachings from the documentary The Wisdom of Trauma flooded my mind. I couldn’t help but wonder about the lives of these two men: Do they have families? Homes? How do they survive amidst such despair? The contrast between the seemingly timeless ruins and the rawness of the present was stark. The Greek government’s efforts to preserve its ancient heritage seemed unbefitting. Those marble stones will eventually come to dust without suffering, while this man was escaping his immediate pain the best way he knew how.
As I continued my walk back to this tiny hotel room, I struggled to find my inner peace, still bewildered. I focused on my body, straightening my shoulders and grounding myself. The city’s sounds faded into the background. Gradually, a sense of belonging washed over me, reminding me of the gratitude I have been feeling since I started nomading and that home is within me.
The interview with Marlena went well despite a few technical and practical hiccups. I pondered whether in-person interviews would be much better, with the added presence and access to more of someone’s body language and emotions. It was my first remote interview, my second interview ever, and I felt no stage fear; it was so natural. Marlena, being the sharp, vulnerable, and endearing woman she is, surely helped. She notably talks about drinking starting at four and those seven seconds of bliss.
I received an encouraging response about a housesitting opportunity in the South of Cyprus from January 18 to 28. The island has been divided since the Turkish invasion in the 1970s. Google Maps indicates a strange zone, a buffer of some sort, between the North and South sides. The red lines for borders I am used to seeing around countries are not there. And I wonder how someone at Google decides to delineate territories of contested land; it must become a geopolitical statement and one with practical consequences for a traveler like me: I am not sure I can cross from the North to the South; I may have to fly or take a boat directly to the South.
In recent months, I’ve struggled with short-term memory issues, but they seem to be fading. My friend Matei, whom I have known since high school and who has been traveling with me for the last few days, hasn’t noticed any lapses. We will go to Mount Athos together, that strange land where women can’t enter-the last one on earth.
If you like my writing, please press the heart button and drop a comment. Share your thoughts and feelings-I’d love to hear them.

Athens is the birthplace of our civilisation. The origin of our democracy and cultural hotspot for philosophers and artists. Athens. A place where creativity stands above money. A vibrant hub between the middle east and Europe. A place where people enjoy living.
No matter if you visit for a day, over the weekend or you take your time to explore the city, make sure you see one of its hidden gems and exceptional cultural sights.
But first things, first. Due to Covid-19 a stay at a designated hotel and a negative test followed by a 7 days quarantine was required to enter Greece. In case of a positive test a supervised 14 days stay has been necessary. Since June 15th Greece restrictions have been eased and Greece has reopened its doors for international travel. In the bridge phase till 30th of June guests from risk areas are tested at a designated hotel — again followed by either 7 or 14 days of quarantine. All other tourists undertake random tests upon arrival. From July 1st onwards the rules will be somewhat relaxed. Find more information here. With 190 recorded deaths, Greece has a comparatively low Covid-19 rate — one of the best in Europe.
Ok, now that you know about the common rules, let me tell you why my heart fully opens up when in Athens.
Come with me and I´ll show you my way of exploring Athens — where south african parrots guide you through the National Garden to the small streets of Anafiotika — sit down, relax, have a greek coffee and enjoy the sun. Discover incredibly creative Graffiti’s on your way to Acropolis. The view is breathtaking. Feel the oriental influence at the bazaars around Thissio and check out the Varvakios food market. Taste the rich flavours of greek vegetables and fruits and try a huge variety of olives. Grab a taxi to Piraeus and be part of the chaotic streets of Athens, take the next ferry to a pine covered sunny island and breathe.
This little walk through Athens should get you inspired. Wanna explore more ? In the following lines I will reveal my little secrets and talk about the must sees. Let’s start with my favourite cultural sights.
Besides the typical let´s say more touristy things, let me tell you about a few other spots that I love to visit in Athens, like the Varvakios market, the Stavros Niarchos foundation or the Filopappou hill.
Since 1884 the so-called Dimotikí Agorá Athinón or as the locals call it Varvákios market has opened its doors from Monday to Saturday for everyone who loves fresh local food. Immerse into a world of smells and tastes between Europe and the Orient. Let me guide you through the market hall and follow me on a short walk between fruit & vegetable stands to have lunch in a simple greek taverna.
Skinned goats hanging upside down, a cowhead staring at you, fishrow on ice, a smell of slightly old blood and a marketer screaming at you in a hall filled with active hustle. Doesn’t sound too inviting ? Well, that’s reality here. The market hall shows authenticity to its fullest and gives you a throwback to how it must have been 100 years ago. You won’t find neatly packed beef filets here, prepared fish carpaccio or beautified little packages of ham. It’s raw, it’s rough and it’s real.
What an experience ! Let’s continue our walk to the vegetarian area of the market that extends alongside the square. You´ll find a variety of local and seasonal fruits in the brightest colours and best qualities — varying according to the season. In between you´ll find stands that offer oriental spices and all kinds of nuts, dry fruits and herbs in bulk. So make sure you have some bags with you and fill them with whatever attracts you most.
After seeing all this delicious food, you´ll be hungry for sure. Enjoy a variety of greek specialities on small plates and share with your friends or family in one of my favourite restaurants — it’s so local that not even google finds it — sorry ;).
From raw, rough and real to amazing architecture & art. The Stavros Niarchos foundation is an organisation that makes grants in the areas of arts and culture, education, health and medicine, and social welfare that solely derived from sales of fossil fuels, as Niarchos was one of world’s largest transporters of oil. Granting $860 million in 2017 the Stavros Niarchos cultural center designed by the renowned architect Renzo Piano opened its doors to the public.
This modern monument includes the national library of Greece and the Greek national opera. A meeting point for everyone who wants to experience breathtaking views, state of the art architecture and enjoy the new greek culture. Inspired by the natural greek flora and fauna the surrounding parks are full of lavender, rosemary and olive trees. A fountain accompanied by classical musical played every hour leads to a path towards the sea.
From classical music to the highest of all goods: nature. From the lively streets of Athens to a tranquille refuge. From marble ground to solid earth. The Filopappou hill is one of my favourite places and for sure one of the most beautiful spots of Athens.
Breathtaking views to the Acropolis, Athens mountains and the sea. Sit on an olive tree and enjoy this unique experience with a bottle of greek red wine.
From one of my favourite places to the unconventional areas I love the most in Athens — from Anafiotika, a village-like neighbourhood next to Acropolis, to Exarchia, the center of anarchism to Omonia, an area to be developed. Let yourself be surprised by the variety and distinctiveness of Athens.
Anafiotika is a scenic tiny neighborhood, a tranquil oasis in the bustling heart of downtown Athens. Narrow passageways filled with small houses, bright colors & plants immediately bring you into a relaxed island mood. The village’s name “Anafiotika” means “little Anafi” and is dedicated to its first inhabitants’ home island. They came to Athens in order to work as construction workers in the refurbishment of King Othon’s Palace.
Meet Exarchia ! The most controversial, the most colorful, the most alternative neighborhood in Athens. This area is a creative and lively art hub renowned for being the historical core of intellectual activism. You can find a lot of restaurants & bars mainly located on Stournari street, also called the Greek Silicon Valley. The National Technical University is as well located in Stournari street and among the oldest higher education institutions of Greece — the most prestigious among engineering schools.
Exarcheia has always attracted exceptional Greek and foreign intellectuals, who lived and worked in the area. The alternative and artistic atmosphere is encapsulated in every corner, every wall, and every individual of this unique neighborhood. Famous (and not only) graffiti artists have left their mark and expressed their message for a more equal world.
Omonoia means concord. It is one of the most historical areas in the center of Athens. In recent years, it has raised a lot of interest from investors abroad, as there are hidden gems of unrenovated apartments in amazingly central locations.
The brand new fountain in times of Covid-19 lifted the spirits of the residents and upgraded the whole area. Further projects like re-think Athens show the start of a movement towards a sustainable Greece.
And after a long day in the bustling heart of Athens — it´s time for some drinks.
One thing is sure — Greeks know how to enjoy life. Their open mentality and willingness to celebrate where and whenever they feel like, is like no other. Here are a few bars that I really like and that I can recommend to anyone who wants to have a fun night out.
heteroclito is an one of a kind wine destination in the historic center of Athens. It´s a small place with a great selection of mostly local and organic wines.
Noel, a magical place. Crazily exaggerated christmas decor, vintage furniture and baroque elements inspired by Cuba, Paris and New York, all mixed up. A big melting pot, always crowded and excellent service.
TAF is an innovative cultural platform, that shows artworks ranging from contemporary, performances, film screenings, roundtable discussions and workshops to music projects, works-in-progress and pop-up projects.
Couleur Locale is a hidden gem in the narrow streets of Monastiraki. Enjoy a stunning Acropolis view and well-mixed cocktails.
The warmth of the greek people, delicious food, the sea and the sun. What more could you ask for ? No matter if on a cultural level or when it comes to taking a break — Greece offers hospitality at its highest level. After this little intro you tasted, heard, smelled, saw and felt Athens with all its beauty and authenticity. So, what holds you back ? Book your trip to Athens and enjoy Greece with all senses.

3 Reasons why I can’t wait to go!
Finally, after much umming and ahhing, pro-ing and con-ing; we have arrived at a winner…
Athens! (if you couldn’t tell by the title and image).
As I stated in my January writing prompt:
medium.com
I was struggling to decide between two ancient powerhouses:
In the red corner, we had Rome. With its beautiful renaissance architecture and awe-inspiring ancient monuments and history. A proud city, with a distinct culture and cuisine.
And in the blue corner, we had Athens. The city that founded democracy, and home of the famous Acropolis. A gritty sprawling mass of brick and concrete, spilt into the Mediterranean Sea, filled to the brim with character and delicious food.
After a hard-fought battle, Athens got its hand raised via a split-decision victory (Athens is a little easier on the wallet).

Carolina: The aftermath of Day 1 was a 12:25hrs sleep. Yes, you read that right, over twelve hours, and guess what? Even after all that sleep, we still woke up feeling like crap. Sorry, Mom, you're not gonna like hearing this but we were both under the weather. No fever but definitely feeling very much out of it, headache, body ache, sore throat, you name it.
Because of that, and because at this point it was 2pm local time, we decided to take it slow. First, we went out to scout some freshly baked bread. We found this bakery that was just a short walk from our Airbnb. Back home, we then cooked ourselves a simple breakfast: 2 eggs and 2 slices of fresh bread toasted in a panini press.
Two DayQuils after, decided that even though we weren't feeling up for the Acropolis, we wanted to do another museum instead. So we made our way to the Acropolis Museum, stopping on the way for some coffee of course.
Will: A broken cash register and a generous Grecian coffee shop owner yielded two free croissants filled with pistachio cream (I enjoyed those for dessert later as they were very much not vegan).
With a cup of coffee in hand, we proceeded to walk up one of the main streets in our neighborhood — Veikou. I kept telling Will how much it reminded me of home. For those who have been in Rio, it looks somewhere between Copacabana and Downtown Rio. There are tons of shops of all kinds everywhere. Camera stores, pharmacies, bakeries, restaurants, cafés, retail, home goods, you name it. You can literally get everything done within a 5 min walk radius.
Another thing that's very prominent in the neighborhoods of Athens is the graffiti. Not the art kind, but the tags (pt: pichagem). It's everywhere you look. It's a bit intimidating at first but it's a very safe neighborhood, mainly elders and a few tourists here and there. Pretty calm overall.
The Acropolis Museum is a gorgeous and modern building. At first glance, it looks like it could be a modern art museum.
The museum was built on top of the ruins of the ancient city of Athens. Underneath it, you can walk around an archeological site with signs explaining what each ruin used to be — a bathhouse, a mansion, workshops... We were the most impressed with how the ancient Greek civilization had a somewhat complex plumbing system with legit pipes and all (keep in mind that this is from the 8th to 5th cent. BC).
Above, in the museum itself, is a gorgeous collection of artifacts from the Acropolis itself and its slopes. They also have a very interesting video on the Persian destruction of the Acropolis in 480 BC and an explanation of how pigments were created using local rocks/minerals (see photo below) — yes, all the ancient Greek sculptures that we know now to be on white marble used to be colored.
After the museum, we went back home, cooked some dinner, and began our work day.

Before we set off to the Greek Islands for 8 days, we had 2 full days to explore Athens, the ancient capitol of Greece.
We arrived in the late afternoon on a miraculously on-time plane from London. After getting our bags we bought a ‘Tourist Ticket’ from the metro station. This ticket includes return to and from the airport and unlimited use of the Athens public transport system. It cost €22 although we didn’t end up using the metro much. Everywhere we wanted to visit was generally walkable. We used it 3 times in total. A simple return ticket for the airport will only cost €14, and if you’re only staying in the city centre for a few days you’ll probably be fine.
We stayed in an Airbnb in Plaka near the Akropoli metro station less than a 5-minute walk to the south entrance of the Acropolis itself. From here, we could get everywhere in the city centre in less than 20 minutes of walking. The centre itself is dense and full of incredible restaurants, historic sights, museums and shops.
Our host, Giannas, welcomed us to Greece with a shot of Ouzo and some recommendations on what to do in the area. We soon learned that Plaka itself is very much catered to tourists. Whilst very beautiful to explore, we couldn’t help but feel it was all just a big show for tourists. Giannas recommended the Monastiraki area for restaurants and nightlife. Our walking tour guide, Michael, echoed these same thoughts, claiming that no Greek people eat food in Plaka!
Good to know in retrospect, and painfully obvious when strolling through and all you see is touristy shops and restaurants. Although the proximity to the Acropolis was excellent and the area was quiet in the evenings. Everything being in walking distance meant it never became an issue.
We started the day bright and early with a walking tour with Athens Free Walking Tour. When travelling to a big city like Athens, a great way to get a feel for the layout, vibe and culture is to take a walking tour. Across Europe there are walking tours for all budgets. Based on experience, the free ones I have done have all been incredibly useful. Nowadays, they’re an essential part of visiting a new city for us.
Before setting on our way we grabbed a couple of macchiatos from the Coffee Island that was nearby.
We want to avoid spoiling all of the surprises of the tour and just give an idea of what you will be doing and seeing:
Our guide, Michael, was very well educated in ancient history and has a deep knowledge and understanding of Athens.
The tour lasted a little under 3 hours and finished in Monastiraki. We took one of Michael’s food recommendations and had an incredible lunch at O Thanasis. The moussaka we had there was the best we had during our time in Greece.
The Central Market is a noisy and bustling fresh produce market. The main hall sells meat and seafood whilst the surrounding area sells vegetables, herbs and spices.
We arrived in the early afternoon. There was still a lot of activity with plenty of sellers around. The seller’s area feels like a relic of the past and not the kind of thing you’ll see in a central part of a modern city. This authentic and local feel really adds to its charm.
Even if you’re not buying, wandering through the market is an experience for the eyes and nose. Although, if you’re a vegetarian or turned off by the smell of meat you may want to skip this place.
The Acropolis Museum is dedicated to the archaeological discoveries from the Acropolis. It can be a good idea to visit here first before going to the Acropolis itself. But either order works.
This sleek, modern building first opened in 2009 and was a welcome respite for us by the blaring summer heat. Close to 4,000 objects are on display here and there are great views of the city from the restaurant terrace.
Entrance only costs €5 and is a great stop for a couple of hours. If you can, hire a guide and you will get so much more out of it!
After some much needed afternoon rest from a packed day of sight-seeing we headed out to Cinque. This is a place to bring your loved one, sip on some divine wine and talk about your experiences of the day.
We sampled a bunch of different wines and shared a meat platter together. The owner explained the origins and optimal tasting experience of each wine we tried. We aren’t serious wine drinkers but I imagine a wine fanatic would get a lot out of this place!
The staff were cheery and helpful, and our names were printed out and placed in a frame for our table when we arrived. These little details are what makes a night at Cinque an unforgettable experience.
We recommend booking beforehand as it’s a very popular place. We got lucky and managed to secure a booking on the day.
Our day was planned around visiting the Acropolis in the afternoon. This was to avoid the mass of crowds and hot weather. We also didn’t want to get burnt out on ancient sites and monuments beforehand.
We both love Greek food and wanted to sample as much of the local food as possible. What better place to do that than Athens? We hastily researched where we should eat and put together a list.
First stop was O Kostas to try the best souvlaki in Athens. Or so they claim. O Kostas is a family run business that has been around for over 65 years. They serve a simple, old fashioned style of souvlaki for €2 each. An absolute bargain.
We both went for pork and devoured it quickly. It was delicious. We could have easily had several more! We had to leave some room for the other food stops though so it was off to get some coffee next.
The unusual name of this cafe stood out to us and good things happen when you combine art and coffee. This stylish spot was full of Greek people of all ages enjoying a chat and coffee. We ordered a couple of iced coffees from here as that seemed to be what was popular.
The coffees were fine. The space itself, however, seems to be the main draw. It feels hidden away and makes a great escape from the chaos outside.
Next up was sampling some Greek style pastries at Bougatsadiko Thessaloniki. The pastries are known locally as Bougatsa. We tried spinach and feta cheese and minced meat. Both were amazing and started our love affair with these pastries.
They’re a common breakfast meal and we had them often during our stay in Greece.
To put it simply, visiting The Acropolis is an absolute must-do whilst in Athens. In the summer months it can get extremely busy, like most of the big ticket sites across Europe. We were advised to visit in the early afternoon, as the mornings tend to be busier and by then the big crowds have finished up and left to eat lunch.
Another tip we came across was entering via the south entrance, which is closer to the Akropoli metro station and Acropolis Museum. This entrance tends to be much quieter than the main one. We lined up for less than 5 minutes to get our tickets here.
One of the best parts about visiting are the smaller temples and sites you can explore as you ascend to the top, where the visually iconic Parthenon rests. You also get great views of the city.
Our last stop for the day was the Thision Open Air Cinema. Located near the Acropolis, this retro cinema has a lot of charm and ended up being one of our fondest memories of Athens. It was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of exploring.
Tickets are well priced and so is the popcorn (and other snacks) and alcohol. There is an intermission during the middle of the film where you can stock up again also. All of this while you sit under the stars with the Acropolis in the background.
Visiting in the evening is essential, and we imagine it would get quite chilly outside the summer months.
After the movie we went back to our Airbnb for some much needed rest. We had an 8am flight the next morning to head south towards Milos, a beautiful island famous for its rocky landscape.

Whenever I travel, I pack my running gear. Partially because I might be training for an upcoming race, but also because there are few better ways to get a true feel for a town.
Running between different places gives you a more accurate feel for scale and distances, something you do not get from travelling by Metro or cab. The Metro makes short distances longer and convoluted, whilst taxis tend to take you through bigger roads, creating a barrier between other people, the terrain, and even the smells.
I enjoyed many things in Athens, from the scenery to the food, but to be fully transparent, the traffic and air pollution were quite off-putting at the beginning. I nearly convinced myself it was a bad idea to go for a run. Aside from the car fumes, we’d barely seen a single jogger on our first day there.
But looking at the map, I noticed there were several large green spaces with fairly little distance between them. So I created an itinerary starting from where we were staying and covering four of the major points of interest, whilst mostly staying off the busy road.
It is worth noting that many of the smaller streets are seldom used by cars, making them much more pleasant than the pavement on the bigger roads. That being said, the pavement is narrow at the best of times and full of obstacles, from holes, steps, parked vehicles, and cats!
Depending on where you are staying, you will need to adapt the itinerary. But wherever you start from, you can keep the general principles and loop through the various sites.
I first started with a large hill close to where I was staying. It is known as Nymph Hill, Pnyx Hill, or Lofos Philopappou depending on which side you are on (at least that’s what I was told). It is about 75 hectares and provides numerous trails partially shaded by pine trees. At the top, you will find the antique ruins of the Prison of Socrates, the Philopappos Monument, and numerous unobstructed viewing points of the Acropolis.
The national observatory is located on the northern side of the park, although I only realised this when spotting the old Doridis National Observatorium from the height of the Acropolis. This side of the hill is also host to the Pnyx Monument. It would be quite easy to complete a 5km run just by exploring the different paths available and going around to see the numerous points of interest.
From there, you can reach the Acropolis in just a few minutes, and run around it mostly on pedestrian streets. At this point, you might want to stop for a quick look at the nicely renovated Odeon of Herodes Amphitheatre situated on the south side, which is accessible without a ticket.
As a next stop, I aimed for the Lycabettus Hill viewing point, which towers over the capital at an altitude of 277m. To reach it from the Acropolis, there is no other way than going across through Plaka, where small streets are busy with shops and tourists, but few cars, at least until you reach the Leof Vasilisis Amaliasthe, which is the busiest avenue. On the other side, you can check the Monument to the Unknown Soldier before going back to smaller streets. At that point, you will have to slow down as the slope gets very steep and the run up zigzags through arid-looking cactus vegetation. It is a breathtaking climb, both physically and metaphorically.
My final stop was the Panathenaic Stadium, which is the only marble stadium in the world. You will need a ticket to get inside and I didn’t have too much time left at that point, but would have liked to run a few laps inside this majestic monument of a stadium.
On my way back, I went for a meander in the Ethnikos Kipos — Athens National Garden. The well-maintained paths are easier than the gravel trail on the hills, and it is worth noting that those gardens are flat as opposed to all previous sites quoted above. Even if you avoid climbing up the Lycabettus Hill, there is no avoiding slopes and stairs when running across Athens. Even though I paused many times to take pictures, I still felt the heaviness in my legs the next day, having totalled nearly 500m of ascent!
One final thought is about the temperature. I visited Athens in November, which was very pleasant and perfect for a run during the day. I know from friends that the heat during the summer is quite unbearable and you would probably have to time your running tour in the early morning hours to escape the beating sun.
Overall, it was a delightful 15km run, which could have been more effective had I not gotten lost a few times. But that was also part of the experience!
My only regret is not having had the opportunity to run the original 42km from Marathon to Athens, which would have been a cherry on this tourist cake. No doubt I will be back for that!

“Prosochí ton eptivon”. A message in Greek broke out through the intercom, pulling me out of my drowsy state. I checked the time. We were soon to land. I inferred I was listening to a seatbelt advisory. Having already fastened my seatbelt, moments later the English version came on confirming my intuition, announcing further that our descent into Athens had begun. I began pinching myself. I had been intermittently napping, but the adrenaline began coursing through me as I approached the land of my fore-bearers. I was arriving, but some part of me felt I was returning. Something was stirring within me.
Curious as to the plane’s relation to Athens I peered outside. Resting above the horizon was a bed of low hanging clouds. The plane was descending along with the sun, which casted an orange-peach hue over the bed of clouds. They were tipped with pink highlights. Fluffy like cotton candy. It was so peaceful. They were hovering over the dark blue ocean as if trying to hide the horizon. This scene mesmerized me. An island quickly faded from the view, supplanted by a mountainous coastline. Greece had already enchanted me with her beauty and I hadn’t even landed yet.
The intercom spoke once again, returning my attention to the cabin. I caught nothing. The phonology captivated me. It swayed itself to a rythm which enchanted me. Had my late papous, my greek grandfather, been beside me he could have translated the message for me. He would have won the hearts of the cabin crew members, by his charm and capacity to speak greek. He would have understood everything. He would be completly at ease. He could have taught me greek. I might have known just enough to impress a greek girl. I am sure that’s what he would have wanted for me. I chuckled.
I felt him near. I felt him almost beside me. I began to concentrate on the map of Greece, displayed on the screen in front of me. Particularly I focused on the Peloponnese where his father Elias emigrated from a little over a century ago. I placed my pointer finger over where I estimated Stemnitsa was, his village. I glanced beside me to the unoccupied seat and wished that he was beside me. I knew I felt him with me. He was in my heart, encouraging me and I knew above he was dancing that his engonós (grandson) was arriving in the land of our ancestors.
I arrived to Athens with no itinerary prepared. I also had no cellular data, so I was already in for an adventure. While this would concern most people I found it better to wing it. An itinerary impeded spontaneity I believed. I was to follow my travel ethos. Be curious and spontaneous. Befriend the local people and live like they do. The “just wing it and see what happens” approach had already taken me far. It afforded me a flexibility that I had enjoyed. It allowed me couch surf in Vienna and befriend two german girls in Portugal. Easy for a white 23 year old male, foolish enough to believe that he manifested this fortuitous timing. Granted it seemed like a recipe for disaster. Often the best moments of travel are the least expected ones. They are the moments you can’t reserve on booking.com. This is a central pillar in my travel ethos. Be present, be curious, be outgoing and learn.
I disembarked the plane with an excitement akin to that of a schoolboy leaving for summer vacation. My immediate objective was to find my way to the city center. With this thrill coursing through my veins, I boarded the X95 bus and seated myself. The man beside me put on his headphones, tuning himself out, but I wanted to tune in. Tune in to this wonderful sensation, this natural high of being in the land of my forefathers.
After taking a seat towards the back, my ears suddenly perked up. It was a familiar language. It was not greek, nor english but rather Spanish. Oh how that thrilled me! I tilted my head back ever so subtly, confirming that given their accent they were a spaniard. I took a glance back at a young man by himself with a phone pressed to his year. We made eye contact and I lingered by eye contact past him, as if I was inspecting the back of the buss to bluff my intrusive gaze. I turned back around, and cracked a smile. He knew I was interested in him. I knew I had to introduce myself. I had attracted a spaniard. It was only natural.
After he ended the call I summoned the courage to introduce myself. His name was Chevem (pronounced “Chema”). “Encantado!” I told him, shaking his hand. He was from Madrid prompting me to tell him, “Me mola mazo Madrid”. He was endeared that I knew such colloquialism. I further appealed to his sense of patria sharing with him of my travels to Madrid and my appreciation of its art and beauty. He was already eager to help orient me around Athens, for he was a tour guide and would show me around he promised. I felt he had been sent from Hermes. As if on cue, a group of tourists asked us what stop we were approaching. Chevem answered them in english and switched back into Spanish to continue our conversation. I felt this seemingly insignificant code switch affirmed my high level of Spanish. He was endeared by an American traveling alone, with an intimate knowledge of Madrid and its colloquialism. It thrilled him to know that I was from Boston, as he told me his close American friend Martin too was from Boston. We became quick companions. Me molaba mazo ese madrileño.
Soon the bus was approaching Syntagma, the city center. We got off together, as he told me his friend was awaiting him to drive him back. He did me a grand favor by sharing his celular data so I could navigate my way to the hostel. We left promising each other that we’d hang out.
When I walked into the hostel I felt like I was crashing a party. The place was buzzing with travelers. I waded through excited travelers drinking and sharing stories to get to the bar which functioned as the hotel’s reception desk. I soon learned it was happy hour. Everyone certainly seemed content, a group of travelers to my left were making a toast.
While checking in, a woman seated to my left answered my question about the Acropolis Museum I had asked the receptionist, informing me it was closed. She then to my surprise invited me to join her for a drink. Despite my fatigue, I joined her briefly, bonding over our common experience running cross country and passion for travel. Suddenly, I felt someone to my right. A women had approached the bar to check in. I moved my chair to afford her more space. I returned myself to the conversation, but with the new guest so close behind me I became distracted. Out of the corner of my eye I sneaked a glance as she headed upstairs, and a sense of regret lingered in me for having not spoken with her. Who was that I wondered.
Feeling hungry and the need for some alone time, I excused myself and headed out alone for dinner. The traveller who had befriended me offered to accompany me, but I politely declined. I was guarding myself a little. For some reason, remaining alone felt most comfortable. Tired, and perhaps accustomed to my solitude, I needed to decompress after hours of travel (in two days I had traveled through three countries).
Soon I found myself at a nearby gyro shop, just around the corner. I was spacing in and out while waiting for my order. Soon, I heard the cook call to me, calling me twice “Friend, friend!”. I turned around to see him smiling beckoning me retrieve the pork souvlaki I had ordered. It was delicious. I was to return here several times, for the quality and for the cheap prices, 2.50 euros for a souvlaki. The place seemed to be family owned becuase of the charm it exuded.
Not a few minutes later entered a young, attractive women dressed in all black. She was alone as well and seemed oddly familiar. She was beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. Black hair and fair skin. She ordered and went outside, I presumed to smoke. One minute there, then she was gone. Quicker than I could think to approach her. My mind, which had been in a state of dormancy due to the exhaustion of traveling that day, came to life. Had I been more awake I might have ordered another souvlaki and waited behind her to strike up a conversation. No, I thought to myself, that would have seemed to contrived. Best that I leave her alone, I figured. But something began stirring within me, urging me to reach out and introduce myself. Just as I had done a hour ago with Chevem. I ordered another souvlaki, perhaps to buy myself more time to think as she was now outside eating her dinner.
Time was ticking. I was mustering up the courage to approach her. Of course I had to. It would be disingenuous to my nature to pass her by without a friendly hello. Yet this is what I did. I left. I didn’t even look her way. She intimidated me. A few paces away from her I halted myself in my tracks. I can’t forego this, I thought. A fierce dialogue was taking place in my head. The voice of spontaneity and the voice, perhaps, of reason. On somewhat of an autopilot I approached her calmy and directly so she could see me. The next moments were a blur.
“Hello, I was hoping to eat with you. What’s your name?” My voice felt shaky as I spoke, and I barely had time to wonder if she could perceive my nervousness or if my words sounded odd before she smiled and replied, “My name is Lisa.”
Noticing her accent, I asked curiously, “Are you French?”
“Yes, I live in Paris,” she said, and my heart fluttered a bit. Her accent was charming. I took a deep breath and attempted my French: “Enchanté, je m’appelle Ryan, Can I take a seat?”
“Of course!”
It was that easy. It somehow seemed easier in Athens. Like it was the only city that two strangers could come together and befriend one another in the snap of a finger. Lighting a cigarette, she shared with me that she’d recently been let go from her job. She was taking advantage of the time to travel, clear her head and search for a new job. I shared with her of my travels through Europe. We quickly bonded over our love for Spain, has she had done Erasmus in Málaga, but confessed to me that she knew little Spanish. Her smile encouraged me, and I felt a rush of warmth by her openness and interest in befriending me. It felt like she too was craving some company.
She soon revealed her impeccable English, delivered with a delightful French accent. Typically, in the first few words, she would insert an “uh” at the end of certain consonants, creating a blunt yet charming inflection. Occasionally, she extended her “a’s,” pronouncing them as “uh’s,” a subtle reflection of her French background. She was already eager to spend time with me and began suggesting ideas. “We could (uh) go to the (uh) park and grab a café,” she suggested, her speech flowing melodically. The predominant quality of her articulation was the way her words blended together, allowing suffixes to soften until certain word groupings became nearly indistinguishable. It was so charming to listen to. She was a chatter box. “I think I have herdt of Boston yes!” she told me.
Not only was her company a wonderful, unexpected gift, but coming to know her that night brought to light the topics most dear to me: my family, friends, and experiences in Spain. Sharing these stories made them feel closer, and brought Lisa closer to me. She opened up about her family, too. With neither of us knowing much about the other’s past, I found such a warmth with her. My heart began to soften as I let go of the negative prejudices towards the French I had internalized from my Italian and Spanish friends. There are bitter rivalries in Europe and France is often on the short end of the stick because squished between all these countries. This generalized animosity towards them.
We put it together that we were staying at the same Hostel. And yes, it was a familiar face because she had been the women who checked in beside me. I had the sense it was her. We walked back together, exchanged numbers and made plans to have breakfast the following morning.
Going out the night before. Smoking for the first time. Karoake.
Within twenty minutes I was standing on hostel’s roof top marveling at the Parthenon. I was still on cloud nine, trying to wrap my head that I already hade made friends in a foreign city. A lot awaited me in that moment. I remained there for a few minutes, appreciating the Acropolis. I called my sister Alexis to her know that I’d arrive safely, and her enthusiasm echoed my own, fueling my anticipation for the adventures that lay ahead As soon as my head hit the pillow I fell asleep.
The next morning, after a restorative night of sleep, I woke up with an insatiable desire to explore. A breeze of fresh air entered the room. I stretched my arms and yawned as I peered over the balcony. The street was mostly covered by these beautiful orange trees. The sidewalks were covered with oranges. The apartments were all white. A cat entered my vision and darted across the road as a car approached. Awake too were the birds. I felt this street was inviting me outside. If every street had this enchanting quality to it I would be content with just a walk through Athens. I had no anxiety to google some generic, curated list of landmark, some “top ten things to do in Athens”. I didn’t need the internet to generate ideas. I sought my own experience. I sought adventure.
I found a table tucked in the corner of lobby and grabbed some fruit. Minutes later Lisa came down and sat down across from me. I continued to share with her what little french culture (music and pop culture) I had assumed from my french friends in León. As she went to grab breakfast I fetched my notebook from my room to jot down some notes as she had already begun to teach me a little french. I wrote for practice “J’aime Marseilles” sharing with her that I would greet my french friend named Theo, from Marseilles, whenever I would see him. Lisa responded “I love Marseilles too”. I made the hand motion that french rapper Juul does, which further endeared her. I appealed to he what little french culture I knew. She was delighted by it all.
After a pleasant breakfast with Lisa I went for a saunter around the Acropolis, familiarizing myself with the area and serendipitously encountering the Areopagus Hill. It is said to be the spot where the Apostle Paul first preached the gospel to the Athenians. I could see why any orator would choose the site, a prominent position where crowds could gather around.
Descending from Areopagus Hill my wandering took me into the city center past Syntagma where I watched the changing of the guard in front of the tomb of the unknown soldier, the n front of the capital building. After the solemn ceremony concluded I went and found another great gyro restaurant.
When I entered the lobby of the Hostel I recognized the man who I had shared the room with last night. I introduced myself to him and learned he was Mumbai. He was friendly and travel savy. We discussed how it had been uncomfortably hot in the room (which is why I alerted him that I creaked open the balcony door to allow some fresh air in). I told him about my pleasant walk I had gone on. It was peaceful walk. You’re not rushed when you walk alone. He told me that he loved traveling alone because everything is done at your pace. He was an agreeable man, filled with anecdotes of travel.
I was amazed to read a small kiosk that taught me of St. Paul’s passage through the area in 51 A.D. The Areopagus Hill is said to have been where Apostle Paul disseminated the tenants of the christianity to the Athenians. That was nearly two millennia ago. Incredible. A marine officer named Josh, who I would meet through the hostel, told me that Athenians, philosophers and politicians would congregate their to debate. It was spot I would return to several times, it wouldn’t get old. I went alone, I went with Lisa one time, I went with Josh and another guy to enjoy the view at night. The touristy environment almost adds to the experience. I practiced a little of my Italian with a family who asked me for their photo to be taken.
From the Areopagus Hill I let the hill take my down into the city center, passing through Syntagma, the city center, and the parliament building. Ahead on the side walk, I saw two soldiers marching towards me. They were dressed in a white garb with a red hat, a traditional uniform.
When I passed the parliament building, again on my way back, I saw the same soldiers guarding what I would learn was the tomb of forgotten soldier. I just happened to catch the change of guard. It reminded of when I was in Arlington national cemetery, witnessing the change of guard at the tomb of the unidentified soldier. We were there for the fourth of July. I was twelve then. Now, standing in Athens, I was reflecting again upon the valor and selflessness of the soldier, ten years older.
I continued walking, thinking about where I would eat. Soon I was seated in a gyro spot that I happened to come upon. The gryo was great. I thought they might have treated me to dessert because I was alone, but I would later learn it is customary in Greece for a small desert to be served.
After lunch I was in need of a siesta, and though tired I was curious to know this convenience shop across the street of the hostel. I was drawn to it by the little fruit stand, with crates of fruit and with bananas hanging. . Drinks, snack, cigarettes organized across the shelves gave the shop a cozy feeling. It had a charm.
I made the conscious decision to buy a greek product, a kind of greek oreo which caught my eye. How was I going to buy there, an oreo I had been eating my entire life? I returned to lie down in my little bed, curious as to how these oreos would taste. These were were the best I’d ever eaten. These had double the quantity of vanilla cream, it tasted fresher and cookie/biscuit part tasted a rich chocolate.
While munching on my third or fourth one (nearly half the pack) I came to discover that I was munching on the original Oreos, called in greek, Papadopoulou. This particular, more mass produced variant, comes from the traditional gemista biscuits. The Oreo I was accustomed too, is the american adaptation, the new kid on the block. The extent of the Greek influence is impressive, I began to realize they had their hands, they invented everything. After I had them, I began to see the papadopoulou’s everywhere I went.
After a little siesta, it was late-afternoon. I checked insta where awaiting me were unread messages from Lisa, who was curious as to my plans. I told her I was going to see a post-impressionist exhibit about a fifteen minute walk from the hostel. We decided to meet there within the hour. I revived myself and made my way over, hoping Lisa en route too, as I remained without data.
I had learned of the exposition from having flipped through a travel brochure on the plane. It was the first of many activities we did together. And through browsing the exposition, I learned more about her. Many of works were based on places with the French Riviera. We conversed about works set in Marseille and Saint Tropez, the later where her sister lives. She told me how beautiful those places are and recommended I travel there. I learned her father is an artist, and though now retired, was an art director (That’s how I would come to learn about Alekos Fassianos, a greek painter, Lisa’s Dad encouraged her to go see). In fact it was after the exposition, Lisa told me she wanted to go to see Fassianos.
After strolling through the well curated exposition we were curious as to what the other galleries contained. The only issue was our ticket was only for the exposition, not the rest of the museum. Though that didn’t discourage us from at least trying to enter the other galleries. We would only get as far as a few steps into them until we were caught, and asked to leave. We tried entering each floor’s gallery, hoping maybe one attendant would be more lenient than the prior, but to no avail. We laughed at ourselves. I did manage to recognize a Giacometti portrait which right by the entrance of the second floor. It belonged to his 1950’s, 60’s abstract yet figurative dull color toned style. It was silly of us.
We had a nice walk back to the Hostel together, where I left her for the day. From the gallery though the route contained its own gems. We walked past the first Olympic stadium and alongside a park full of preserved classical greek pillars and such. I took siesta and when recharged wanted to return to the Agora hill, where I had been that morning, to catch the sunset. With the luxury of time, taking advantage of appreciating the sunset was very important to me. It was a bit cloudy but I enjoyed viewing the Acropolis illuminated by light at night. It appeared even more impressive. The view motivated me with the time remaining that night to go to the museum.
With only an hour remaining, there was barely anyone in the museum and I felt that I had it all to myself. I progressed my way through the floors arriving to the top floor where I encountered the marble friezes of the Parthenon. The Acropolis was in view, the Parthenon itself stood illuminated, visible through the window.
Across from what video essay about the Acropolis. I was drifting on and off. Despite my fatigue and intermittent lapses in attention (jolting awake when a couple passed by) I learned of the tragic saga of repeated plundering and pillaging. I was shocked to learn, a French ambassador, in a bid to document the Acropolis, commissioned an artist to sketch and survey it. They ordered them to “Take everything you can [from the Acropolis], leave not the living or dead” It was shocking to see that written. That it still remains despite everything its endured is incredible. Wars, pillaging, yet it remains testifying to its sacredness.
The friezes themselves are magnificent, I was left quite impressed, proud to be related to a culture which takes great pride in its art and tradition (and the friezes are the union of both). They are remarkably preserved, and beautifully crafted, a testament to the talent of their sculptors. They depict scenes from the annual celebration of Athena such as chariot riding and processions of soldiers and citizens. Something began to dawn on me though, as I browsed, as I passed through the floor. As I saw gap after gap left intentionally between the friezes, I began to feel quite sad. The museums had intentionally left these sizable gaps between the conserved friezes to serve as a poignant reminder of the western pillaging that occurred through its history.
Lord Elgin plundered these friezes. This impunity is deplorable. One can now see in the British Museum.
The next day we went to see the Acropolis up close. Having gone to the museum the night before, I was ready to appreciate now equiped with the it’s historical context. That morning I used the panini press and made myself a simple ham and cheese sandwich. I added some apple slices, tomatoes, I sat myself down with Lisa. After a little ham and cheese pannin some fruit and coffee I headed with her to the acropolis. I attempted to use my NIE card, which proved my residency in Spain to enter for free but they caught me. She was let in free for being under 27 and a EU citizen.
She was happy to help me learn a little french it was almost comical the contrast that she spoke english incredibly well and I with my ten words in french was just hopping to add an eleventh.
As we ascended up to the Acropolis, we were greeted by the striking ruins of the theatre and the statue of Dionysus. The archaeological remnants left us in awe. A cat rested on some stones, welcoming us to the ruins. Lisa, enchanted took out her phone to take a picture of the cat, with the view of the theatre behind. She told me she would send the photo to one of her sisters, also a cat lover. We began petting it. It’s back was warm and soft. I told the cat “enchante” french for enchanted. It seemed like there was a cat everywhere in Athens awaiting to greet us.
The Parthenon was striking to see up close. I concentrated on the friezes, only a few remained intact.
Lisa led me to over to the smaller temple of Athena where I began to hear spanish spoken among a group of tourists. There were gathering themselves to pose for a photo.
As we drew nearer, I mentioned to Lisa that they were Spanish, having caught a few words. One of them had said “Venga” which gave me a laugh. Suddenly I was being asked by one of them in english to take their photo. I was of course delighted, feeling lucky to be chosen as I was already speaking to them in Spanish. “A ver, que guapos, que grupo” This enchanted them. I explained to them that I was an American studying abroad in León, justifying my decision (as I often do)
One of them told me to go along with my girlfriend, as they assumed she was my girlfriend, I told them the truth that she was my travel companion. One of them said to me “todavía” Lisa was a bit shy with them but she did speak a little Spanish to their delight. We ran into them a few more times around the Parthenon, and they remained enchanted by this fluent Spanish speaking American and his french travel partner.
I loved talking about French and American culture with her as we walked around the Parthenon. We were looking out over into Athens. Athens is a sea of white apartment dotted with ruins. Lisa, her french accent, was very beautiful to listen to.
We also ate a really lunch. There was this appetizer I was going to order but the waiter interceded and recommended I get the eggplant one that is made following his grandmothers restaurant. It was as he said delicious. I also tried Tsatsiki sauce. My mom loves eating eggplant so I thought of her.
Meeting up with Chema was a challenge in of itself. Lisa and I were heading out to Syntigama, where he told us he’d come too, but I didn’t have any data. We had to duck into a café by Syntigama square so I could hop on the wifi and locate him. After walking around a little aimlessly, we found our bearings and confirmed with him that we were to meet him in front of a Gucci store. We waited a few minutes talking about(I wouldn’t realize the irony of our meet up point until getting to know him a bit later). I was reassuring Lisa that her Spanish was good enough to understand him.
He began to take us on a private tour of the area explaining to us the significance. He was speaking in Spanish.
We met Martin in a plaza where an old greek orthodox church stood. They showed us this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant called Alvi. The food was deilicious. No signage, one would have hardly recognized it existed at all. There was no receptionist, we passed through a narrow hall which led to an open space with these small tables. A cat crawled beneath my legs. I was enchanted with this local place far from tourist crowded sites.
We talked about many things, politics, political theory and in several different languages. English served as the common language when we all talked with one another. Chema and I would break off and speak Spanish with each other. Lisa and Martin communicated in French. Chema and Martin ordered in Greek. I was their pupil, they were my professors and new found friends on that warm Greek night — sharing food wine and conversing in Spanish, French, Greek, and English, speaking the language of those whose hearts align in hope and outrage against injustice. I had an insatiable curiosity to learn how Chema and Martin perceived art and history, language class struggle, Karl Marx, and Noam Chomsky.
I was amazed that here I was gathered in this local, off the map spot, with a beautiful french women accompanying me on my travel, a madrileño I had befriend on the bus and Martin, sharing stories of Athens and being an expatriot teacher. I must have taken it for granted that there I could be in their company, a young educated man about his tour through Europe, a member of an upper class family, and at the same time, with the company of this cultured french women, indulge himself in the diversion of meeting Anarchists; and enjoy a delicious meal as Chema and Martin explained, that the Athenian anarchist movement still breathed life into the last stronghold of international anarchism — a city harboring the fading echoes of ancient Athenian civilization. Lisa and I were with them but yet so far from their every day lived experience that I felt this fraudulence for simply agreeing with their radical view. Their raw authenticity, that they truly lived as they thought, compelled an agreeable response from me — one that felt utterly uncharacteristic. My professors and their progressive stances then seemed so inauthentic…
They told us that there was to take place a rally the next day because Greece was to privatize its school system. They invited us. We told them we would let them know. Our hesitancy discouraged them. After all we were travelers, how much was their to expect to us? They took that as a polite no, but I felt part of genuinely considering it. This wasn’t your standard vacation.
After dinner we went to this cool bar and because it closed we went with our drinks and found a little bench on the side of the street. They were smoking and the subject of the conversation was about French anarchism and the French Revolution the revolt of ’68 and the realist French art movement like Gustave Courbet
The gritty nature of the Athenian streets enchanted me. There’s this certain beauty to the urban messiness of Athens that I came to appreciate.
I don’t think I wasted a second of my time in Greece, certainly not by walking its streets with the simple desire to be lost in them. The following morning I rose early as was my habit while traveling and stretched my legs around the neighborhood. I was already getting a feel for the area and felt somewhat adjusted to the rhythm of the bustling city. I was content.
A man with a friendly face was stationed in the middle of the street. A street seldom trafficked by cars. I had already passed him once as I ventured out from the hostel, and he gave me a smile prompting me to greet him “kalimera” (good morning). In fact that simple interaction had given me the confidence to say kalimera to others who I passed, and this simple phrase helped me blend in, giving others the impression that I was a greek speaker. This felt incredible. It felt like I had really transformed myself into a native greek. Their came a certain validation from receiving these greek greeting, although they were simple and said reflexively I had an enormous pride to be engaging with them through their language.
There I was trying to make sense of what this man was promoting. To my delight, when I inspected more closely the entrance he was stationed by I realized he was working for the Cafavy Archive. The great greek poet C.P Cafavy had lived there. I felt a rush of excitement. I immediately thougt of my Dad who had introduced me to his genius. The friendly greek man outside approached me informing me that it was open to the public. He could see the excitement brewing within me. That was a lovely interaction for us both. I was spewing with excitement. Something told me he didn’t get to many 22 year old greek American solo traveler’s getting this excited for having stumbled upon the archive.
My excitement was contagious and it quickly spread to the rest of the staff who attended my questions. They informed me that the archive had just opened and I had been one of it’s lucky first visitors. They all seemed eager to answer any questions of mine. I felt well received.
These kind of fortuitous, meaningful discoveries were somehow awaiting me throughout the whole week. As I left the archive after having combed through everything it had to offer me, I interacted once more with the friendly gentlemen outside. I thanked him and wished him a good day. There’s a heightened sense of euphoria when one stumbles upon something that had been latently desired.
The archive reminded me of the epic poem of his, titled Ithaca. It was the appropriate poem to mull over given the adventure I had embarked on. The poem is sung to Ulysses the wayward captain returning from the Trojan war. It’s the journey that confirms the mission and the mission that confers the journey. The poem would remain with me for the rest of the trip. As I made the short walk back to the hostel, I felt enlightened. I began reciting the opening line of the poem. The words of the opening verses characterized the spirit of my travel.
As you set out for Ithaka
pray your journey is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
The remainder of the day was filled with adventure and discovery. Lisa took me to a café her friend recommended to her in Exarcheia. It was called Lacantina and we had falafel.
We were amazed at all the street art which made the entire neighborhood pop with color. At the museum of archeology we were impressed by this painting which one sees as they ascend the stairs.
We met up with Chema who was gracious enough to continue to touring us through Athens. He took me a bookstore where with help from an employee I was able to find a collection of Cafavy’s poetry that I wanted to gift my father. He was soon to retire. It was essentially again a private, expedited tour.
The following morning I needed to get myself to Piraeus, the nearest port to Athens. I wanted to visit this island that Lisa had told me about. Unfortunately, she wasn’t feeling well enough to do the excursion and had to remain resting in the hostel. I didn’t have any cellular data, so I mapped out the route and trusted everything would go smoothly.
The only complicated transfer was when I arrived Piraeus, I was unsure of what bus to take to get myself to the ferries. I could see the ferries, they were probably a mile or so away. While I decided what to do I order this sesame bagel stuffed with cream cheese. It was delicious. I got it from the kind of café that serves you directly on the street. I loved those little cafés.
I figured I would take any bus I could get and that I could assess from there if it was heading towards the ferries. Luckily I hopped on a bus that took me to more or less the spot I needed to be. I found the blue ferry building and I bought tickets from a kind greek women. She pointed her finger to the ferry that I needed to take and told me to hurry as it was embarking soon.
I rushed over. Got on board. And made my way to top. I could breathe. The hard part was over. I decided to take in the sun and rest a while.
After a short rest I wanted to walk around the ferry. It wasn’t so crowded. I found a corner where I could seclude myself and obtain a view of the ocean. It was msrvillous. The sea was shiny, glistening from the bright sun. I felt somewhat the sun made the blue of the ocean appear lighter, almost more vivid. I am not sure what the effect what but I felt my sense of vision improve itself. It was stunning to watch us approach these islands.
A women politely asked me if I could take picture of her and her daughter, pulling me from the hypnotizing effect of the sea. She was celebrating her fiftieth birthday by taking a trip with her daughter. I wished her a happy birthday.
I walked over with her to meet her daughter. There was something so warm about her that reminded of my mother. She called “my darling”. I was suddenly taken by their openess and warmth. They lived in London and spoke english with the British accent. Madu was a nurse and was born in Sri Lanka, a country unfortunately plagued with political violence.
Her daughter was my age and soon to graduate college. She wanted to become a doctor. I found her accent so charming. Their company and conversation quickened the ride and after talking about my year abroad, my family, America, politics and contemporary issues the ferry was already soon to dock. We soon parted ways and confirmed that we would see each other again on the return trip.
It didn’t take long for the island to enamor me. A charming little church greeted us on the dock. I had never seen a church on a dock before. Its white exterior seemed to glow ever strong with the sun’s pounding radiance. The sun warmed my spirit.
As I made my way through the town it easy to identify who and who wasn’t a local. There were tons locals riding motorcycles, the most comfortable mode of transport I figured. While they were in the middle of their errands, while travelers criss crossed the roads, impeding the flow of this slow paced island life. Even the signs enchanted me, as everything felt simpler, more elemental. I popped into greek orthodox churches and paused to take photos.
I didn’t know where I was going. I figured I would stick to the coast line and follow it. An hour had passed and I realized I was no where near the little village I had ventured out to see. The island was far bigger than I had estimated.
That’s when the courage came upon me to stick out my thumb and see if I could hitch hike, to really test the friendliness and openness of the greek people.
There was already a truck departing near me from this road I was coming from. When I held out my thumb and pointed with my other hand left the truck driver who I’d said , no he said greek and I instinctively said what he told me back he pointed the other way. Essentially he through his hands communicated that he was headed the opposite way.
The next car which drove by was this older mean who I saw was wearing a mask who politely acknowledged my request but politely declined touching his mask as to indicate de didn’t feel well. He didn’t want to contaminate me. Two cars later came Stavros who pulled ahead of me and scrambled to clear the passenger seat of some kind of bird cage. He was eager to have me. I didn’t even know exactly where I wanted to go, which didn’t seem to suprise him. I trust him and he assumed my destination was the next port which was where I intuitively was heading.
The seatbelt didn’t quite click activating an alarm. I had to hold it the buckle in place to cancel the alarm. We chatted for a brief five minutes and he taught me a little greek and he was delighted to hear that I, being American, had greek ethnic heritage. It was easy to impress him with phrases like “Christos anesti” “Opa!”. I thought he had a simple soul, so impressionable by my limited showing of greek. He was happy for me. I could tell that. It seemed like of all the people on the island and it was him who was awaiting for me to meet him. Something about the trust we had both in each other to go through with the hitch hike made the connection seemingly more profound.
By then it was early afternoon and the island became even more beautiful somehow. Time seemed to slow itself in this little enchanting port. Stavros had dropped me off and went about his errands.
There seemed to be more cats than humans.
I went through the village’s quiet streets. It was apparent I was the only tourist which felt odd. After wandering through the little port which didn’t take to long to fully know, I found a bench and sat myself down on the left side and within a second it collapsed under my weight. A few women behind me chucked and smiled at me, as I brought myself to my feet. Had I known greek I could have connected with them further. But the moment we shared was sufficient enough to express everything it held, the clumsiness and silliness of sitting in a bench that collapses beneath you. I tried to reassemble the bench but one of the green beam came out when I pulled it. Then I began to laugh and it felt so great to laugh as I walk away from the pile of beams that once was a bench.
Farther along the road I found a little rocky point along the coastline of ηέρδικλ to pause to reflect on the day, recording some thoughts in my travel journal. I recorded some of Cafavy’s poetry. As I gazed across the ocean toward the island, it felt as though the entire spectrum of blue had come alive before me — each shade represented. The sky and sea seemed to blend into one infinite canvas, every pigment of blue imaginable dancing between them. I closed my eyes momentarily, letting the first glimmer of sight settle in my mind, only to open them again, just to remind myself it was real.
Before me stretched a shimmering path, reaching across the ocean out into the horizon beneath the sun’s embrace. The gentle chirping of birds filled the air, weaving themselves into the rhythm of the waves. In that moment, I was utterly still, wholly content, and wonderfully alive.
I was so content.
I was in a state of atraxia, a state of tranquility and equanimity, free from worry and distress. Atraxia is derived from the Greek words a-, meaning “not”, and tarassein, meaning “to disturb or confuse”. Epicureans sought ataraxia as the highest goal and considered it to be true happiness.
After a brief stint of reflection I sat myself down at a calm restaurant for a late lunch. Everything I had was so fresh and delicious.
I was seated contemplating what I wanted to choose for dessert. I was going to receive a customary dessert and was given the option. A lady across from was ease dropping and interceded for me. She was an elderly women who insisted that I try a certain dessert. Of course, I obliged and went with her recommendation. She and her husband were retired greek Americans who had recently made the island their home. They told me how peaceful it was to live there. They soon gained my trust. It gave them joy to know I was greek American. They took me under their wing and expressed their concern that I was not going to make the ferry on time. I was so relaxed it would not have stressed me to coordinate how I was ever to make it back on time with no ride. They told me they would bring me.
First they wanted to show me the island. They had fallen in love with their new home. They had friends through the island and as we passed their home they shared with me anecdotes of the friendliness of their neighbors. I was impressed by how concentrated the island was with these tiny churches. Bella told me there were 360 churches dotted across the island. They explained to me that the island was home to the monastery of a greek Saint named Agios Nectarios, also known as the Wonderworker of Aegina. He was miracle healer who is considered the patron saint of people with cancer, heart disease, arthritis, epilepsy, and other illnesses. Dino told me: “and give his money to the poor people whatever money they give”
They drove me through the winding roads of the island and brought me to see the monastery, one of the most visited sites on Aegina. The monastery grounds include a large church and a small chapel where St. Nectarios’ tomb is located. Thousands of pilgrims come to the island every year they told me to honor him. They were devout greek orthodox christians and their faith inspired me. They spoke so simply. “Follow your grandfather, it makes sense” Dino said to me. He implored me to become greek orthodox.
As we zipped towards the main port I felt an incredible desire to rekindle my sense of pride in being greek. I felt an incredible honor to share ancestry with these humble simple people. I expressed to them my desire to buy pistachios. The island was known for its pistachios. They dropped me off near a pistachio vendor. I had a hour to kill and wanted also to explore the nearby marketplace. There was a fish market and other stores that I bopped into. I came across an artist selling his drawings. I stopped to appreciate his artwork. He drew on whatever he could find, scraps of paper and this captivated me. He read my interest and gave me a price. I confessed to him that I didn’t have much cash and we negotiated a price for a few drawings. I was thankful. I complimented him. He told me he was a Belgian but the art world disillusioned him and he left to find a simpler way of life. He felt he had become creatively a slave to his patrons and yearned to have the freedom to create as he pleased. He had a lucrative career in Antwerp, but walked away from all the money to rediscover his happiness. I found that admirable.
Then as I was walking away from him to my delight a fish vendor called to me signaling that Madu was chasing me down. I didn’t know that she was seated at a nearby restaurant, and through a window had spotted me speaking with the artist. She invited me into the restaurant and asked if I was hungry. I politely told them I was good but appreciated their generosity. I could tell they really enjoyed my presence, which made them already feel like family to me. It’s amazing how quickly you can bond with strangers through this particular feeling.
I also had gone into other merchant’s shops. I tried baklava. The sweet crunchy flakey dessert. Its origins are contested amongst the Greeks, Turks and Lebanese with some saying it originated in Persia. The store owners were very kind to me. They exuded kindness as had everyone on the island.
Later that night I return to Athens via the metro with Madu and her daughter. It was a pleasant return. Lisa awaited me and we went out for dinner. It was a magical day. I was reflecting and treasuring the experiences I was having, bringing them deep within my heart.
I arose after a restorative sleep somewhat on the later side. When I came down to the hostel lobby I found Tristan, the guy from Maine I had befriended. He was seated at the bar and I told him it was Joshua Laurence a chamberlain the colonel who defended the union left flank at Gettysburg. He was a history buff like me and I appealed to his Maine nativity. He was excited at what I had learned. After hours of fighting they ran out of ammunition so Chamberlin ordered a bayonet charge. The line prevailed and the Union army won the battle. The night before we were talking about the civil war and how he grew up attending St. George a private school where Rucker Carlson’s kids attended. He knew Bobby. He loved sailing. We enjoy several chats together. He was one of many people I so easily bonded with that week.
Lisa came down for breakfast and I excused myself from Tristan to greet her. We ate breakfast together and I showed her the art I bought from Chem the migrant Dutch artist on Aegina. Lisa and I had only more or less of an idea for our itinerary. We tossed out ideas, while trying some of the delicacies I had procured from the island. We tried the pistachio wafers fillers with this pistachio butter cream. They were really rich almost too much I joked. I even gave one to Josh who also was at breakfast. I recommended he go to the island and gave him the run down. He was there in Greece on leave from his military service. He was a greek orthodox and was excited to explore all the churches. Aegina would be great. I told him of my travel and he seemed eager to go. He in return recommended I go to Socrates prison.
Lisa and I went to yesterdays bread where I bought a nice vintage flannel. We’ve really had all this time this week to get to know each other. I’ve been following the story of her job situation and prospects marketing this French purse brand. Her first interview went well and today she met with the HR women to discuss salary. The final interview is this Monday so I’m praying that she gets it. The consequences weren’t that grave if she doesn’t get. In fact it would free her schedule allowing her to join her family in the Pyrenees to ski. It impressed me that she express these conflicting feeling in english so fluently.
After a little thrift shopping and Lisa’s fashion advice, we went out separate ways her to the interview and to the Alekos Fassianos exhibit. You realize here that people walk very nonchalantly. It’s a beautiful neighborhood. It’s quite sad that the center park is occupied. The federal government is planning to build a metro in Exarchia even though the referendum BU the locals was overwhelmingly against it.
The Fassianos exhibit was this hole in the wall place. There was no signage indicating where it was. I arrived and someone was scavenging through trash directly outside. I had the good fortune of arriving when a Greek women did too. I could tell she was also confused and asked her. She went into a convenience store where with the owner she asked. We eventually found it but I kind of piggybacked off her Greek to find it. I might not have found it without her presence, even though it was hidden in plain day. It was odd.
The exhibit was great. I really liked his style. It’s Picassoesque but very much his own. I particularly liked the one of Hermes on the bicycle. The greek God of messages is depicted on a bike, which I thought was quite suiting. His color palette too is so beautiful. I like the little details he incorporates into the background of his painting. Churches and often appear in his works. I must have spent a hour soaking in everything I could about the artist. I even bought some of his postals.
I had learned of him through the Lisa’s Dad who recommended she go. He was an art director teacher and continues to paint teaching a class to newly arrived immigrants. He draws a lot of nudes. Lisa actually doesn’t like his style which was a very honest confession. But she of courses loves him and the other day she called him while we were walking to get his advice. (How are you in French is pronounced more like saw va)
When I met up with Lisa after it was at six dogs a cafe besides a tattoo parlor that seemed good. I had been expressing to her my desire to get one and she encouraged me. The tatoo artist was named Bill. Bill was like always go with the women’s advice bc I though to get the smaller one. I got my first tattoo of the word Arete. Greek rap was playing in the back. I was nervous. Having Lisa there meant a lot to I think she really was encouraging. I got it tatted behind my elbow the the ancient greek word Αρετή — “arete”. It’s a beautiful word which translates to having excellence in all facets of life. It means to strive to achieve excellence in the moral, physical and mental spaces of one’s life. But beyond its translation, I’ll dive later into the meaning of the tattoo.
That night Lisa and I left the hostel to go see the sunset over Athens. We went to the Areopagus hill which is said to be where St. Paul preached the gospel to the Athenians. The view was beautiful of the city. The acropolis and everything was super pretty. Lisa and I agreed it’s better to have about a week to get to know a city like about the size of Athens. You’re not rushed and you can really get to all the areas, even the non tourist areas.
Martin recommended we go see it from here: His footnote to the link was “Go to the basketball courts then climb up the hill” https://maps.app.goo.gl/7xyos2vv716bxahg6?g_st=iw
After the sunset we met Martin at the Omonio metro station. From there we walked to a restaurant in a neighborhood he told us is starting to become trendy but still not known by tourists. That’s always music to my ears, I am always conscience of my effort to experience the authentic neighborhoods of a place. Around the hostel and Acropolis is the tourist friendly district.
Martin took us to a restaurant called Exodus Kafeneio. Martin ordered three beers for us in Greek. The waiter was friendly, Martin is considerate too he wanted to ensure we had the seats which faced the street. We were there sipping our mythos thanks to him. I relished this pork in wine and pepper sauce dish and tried some of what Martin got Turkish tortellini (tortellini with beef, cow butter, yogurt and garlic sauce, chili pepper flakes) it was great.
Martin opened up to us about his book project which is about this person who is searching for a lost artist across Detroit and Greece. He was telling us about how little the teachers are paid and many teachers work and come back from work to teach four classes of English to get by. The majority of people lost all their savings in 2008 and 2012 and people live without savings.
He used to be a communist but now is an anarchist. He shared us a story about how he was protesting in Charleston during the George Floyd riots (he was bartending there) and when the rioters smashed into a break the communist discouraged it. He realized that then they weren’t as radical as they though. They wouldn’t support the redistribution of wealth to members oppressed by centuries of racism. Also in Athens in 2011 the anarchist had the numbers to storm the parliament building but the communists prevented them. The communists and anarchists do not get along in Athens.
It’s hard to explain, and I’m sure I won’t get it quite right. You see, when you travel, you experience the moment you’re in, which absorbs you completely. It pulls you into the present, as everything you see feels new. But travel also has a way of pulling you backward in time, and even forward into the future.
Spending time with Lisa made me realize just how warm and open-minded she is, which softened some of my once harsh, intense attitudes toward the French. She confessed — quite honestly — one of the common generalizations about French students on Erasmus: their tendency to isolate themselves with only each other. And yet, I found myself defending them, comparing it to how Americans can be far more insular and ignorant. My time in Athens didn’t make me less interested in Americans; it made me even more curious about Europeans and their ways of thinking. I felt beholden to them, learning so much from their culture, their history, and their perspective.
Somehow during my week in Athens my thoughts always returned back to my family, especially my sister. We called each other one night and I cried telling her how much I missed her. I had never felt so close to my immediate family — my sister, my dad, my mom — thinking especially of her and the way she relates to our father, Angelo. Travel itself triggers its own kind of internal journey — one of reflection. Memories return, and moments once forgotten recrystallize, emerging with a clarity they didn’t have before. It’s as if the act of moving through space creates a new lens through which the past is suddenly sharper, more vivid, and connected to the present in unexpected ways.
In the end, my time in Athens was not just a trip across the world; it was a journey through time, through family, and through the layers of identity that have shaped me. The presence of my Pappous, though no longer physical, was a constant companion — guiding me, encouraging me, and reminding me of the values he lived by. As I traced the geography of my ancestry, my travels took on a deeper meaning. It was not merely about seeing new places; it was about rediscovering a part of myself that had long been dormant, a part of me that is both Greek and American.
I discovered the works of Alekos Fassianos and the french post impressionists. The vivid, dreamlike paintings of Fassianos seemed to speak directly to the spirit of the Greek people — capturing the mythic beauty of Greece while reflecting its modern, complex soul. Each painting felt like an extension of the landscape itself, echoing the timeless dance between the past and present.
And it was C.P. Cavafy’s words from Ithaca that echoed in my mind as I walked along the shore of Aegina: “To buy fine things, mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, sensual perfume of every kind — as many sensual perfumes as you can.” The poem spoke to the idea that the journey is as important as the destination, and that the true treasures lie in the experiences themselves. In this, I found a blueprint to reflect upon my own journey. The beauty of an island which unfolded itself in layers to me: the shimmering glow casted over the tranquil waters; the warmth of the sun and people, their hospitality as beautiful and inviting as the land itself.
It was on that island, I realized that my journey mirrored the archetypal one Cavafy describes: I heard the call, I passed the tests, and I left transformed. Greece, with all its layers of history, culture, and personal connection, continues to call me back. In its landscapes, its people, and its poetry, I found not only echoes of my Pappous’s legacy but also the deepest parts of myself.
This trip became more than just a moment in time — it was a full circle, a reunion with my heritage and an awakening to the world around me. As I carry these experiences, I feel myself walking further into the future, yet always anchored by the wisdom of the past. Greece will always be there, calling me to return, as it continues to shape my path forward.

When I was moving out and selling as much as possible someone came to my apartment to buy my old mattress. On their way out they saw the two photographs I’d printed and mounted on the wall. They asked about buying them and I decided to give them the one of Saratoga beach. The brush of pastels spread across a sunset beach had given colour to an otherwise empty apartment. It was time to move on. Giving away my DIY print was a great ending for something I can no longer retain. The other print, of Yuki at a pagoda in Japan, didn’t seem appropriate to give away and so I threw it out — a symbolic guesture to move out and move on.
I’ve come to Athens on a class trip with ten other students and my studio professor. We are here as tourists but also researchers, seeking to understand the architecture and archeology of the city and islands in the Agean.
On the first day we walked around the the Archaeological Site of Kerameikos. This was the first of many walking days to other ancient ruins including the Roman forum, Hadrians library, Ancient Agora, temple of Zeus and Aristotle’s school. Many of them are ruins with little remaining but help to understand the history of the city. Since we were travelling as an architecture class, our focus was largely on the building ruins and urbanism.
One of the most interesting walks was on the first day when we visited Philopappos Hill across from the acropolis. In the 50s an architect by the name of Dimitris Pikionis oversaw the construction of roads and pathways that transformed the landscape from a visual experience to one that included the tactile roughness of old stones collected from the city. He salvaged marble slabs and reused them as paving stones to make pathways. This got me thinking that I should explore walkscapes in my future architectural research and the ways different ground conditions affect the user experience. The ground and pathways played a small part in the book I self published and my thesis. This is an area I’d like to investigate further.
The path led to a reconstructed church and pavilion. At the time of construction the pavilion had a view of the acropolis but is now blocked by trees. Our professor was of the opinion that the way the pavilion connects views, landscape, and movement all together makes it one of the most important transformative works of modern architecture. I would agree that the pavilion is quite nice and impactful but I don’t know enough of its legacy to understand it’s significance.
As one ascends past the pavilion, various glimpses of the acropolis are visible between trees and bushes. The acropolis is always present and is beautiful. The pathway changed slowly from smooth slabs to rougher flagstones eventually reaching an open plaza and at the top a monument that was once a tomb. This was our first glimpse of the city from above but not the last.
The art of photography has in it emotions of the photographer. The past three years of graduate school have been largely framed as a period of self development and growth accelerated by an abrupt transition from partnered to solitary life. I see a clear personality in the lineage of my photography that I am keen to change. Now that I’m travelling alone I feel that it is appropriate to find a new way of looking at the world. I want to be different and see that in my photography. I want this new chapter to be transformation and evolution.
A year ago, I bought an extra wide camera lens for landscape photography and sold my stock lens that was no longer giving me sharp images. This purchase was a legacy of my previous perspective to frame open landscapes and wide vistas behind a solitary figure.
As this trip approached, I reassessed my desire to obtain a zoom lens thinking that zooming in would be a suitable way to alter my perspective. I couldn’t find a good deal on a used lens and was also busy with school. A week before my departure I was again looking for a specific camera lens and reading online that eBay would be a good place to get second hand lenses. At 2AM I purchased a lens from Japan that would arrive a few days before I left. I was concerned about it arriving late because I would be moving out of my apartment the day I departed. Unfortunately I did not read the listing properly because the lens was an a-mount SAL18135 and my camera needs an e-mount SEL18135. I didn’t expect a lens would be made with different mounts so I got the wrong lens.
During our time in Athens we also visited many museums including the acropolis museum, museum of contemporary art, and archeology museum. The acropolis museum was the most interesting because it was the first thing we did in Athens and the building was very modern. It had fragments of the acropolis arranged along an interior core the same size and dimension as the pantheon. Chunks of the ruin had been placed to give a semblance of the real thing up on the hill. As an introduction to the archeology we would see in the next few days, it was an excellent appetizer. Below the museum was an excavated neighbourhood.
The museum of contemporary art was interesting because there were provocative works that spoke to geopolitical issues, pain, and suffering. We we fortunate to have a guided tour by a curator and access to the roof that is normally closed to the public. This was a unique view of the city because there aren’t many buildings taller than theirs from which to see the rest of the city. It was also relatively close to the acropolis which has protected views.
While it can be difficult to imagine a world based on foundation ruins, it helped to hear stories and read history. The acropolis was as highlight well worth the early morning visit. Arriving at opening avoided the crowds and was under a softer sun that wasn’t as draining in terms of heat. The ruins were impressive because they are clearly visible from the city but up close the scale became larger than expected. In the past it would have been possible to walk within the ruins but that has been closed off and some kind of reconstruction work was underway.
The visit to the acropolis was complemented by a reading from the professor that I reread while sitting on a piece of marble at the acropolis. The reading described the entrance sequence and the arrangement of buildings forming an asymmetrical aesthetic perspective. After reading the article I was able to walk the space and assess it for myself. It is not entirely visible today because a large statue is missing and the pedestrian pathway was altered with a horrible slab of concrete but it is otherwise accurate and interesting.
For the modern urbansim, we visited the an urban park along the port coast that was made for the 2004 Athens Olympics by destroying an industrial area and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center by architect Renzo Piano which was a fantastic example of an urban park on a slope. Unforutnately the library was closed but the upper lighthouse lookout was open and was an interesting moment to see the port as well as the park.
Athens is a wonderful city. I’ve been continuously impressed by the kindness, generosity, and politeness of the people. Twice we went to restaurants where we unknowingly ordered the wrong thing and twice we were offered food on the house to compensate. The people have been patient and kind- an unexpected delight. As well, the platting has been fantastic and the food delicious. Many of our meals came with a shot or dessert to finish off. We’ve also eatten a lot of soulvaki and gelato. It feel like we didn’t go a day without a stop for gelato.
Two other very enjoyable moments were the climbing of Lycabettus hill and Lofos Strefi. The first is one of the most prestigeous hills that make up ancient Athens and is a fantastic lookout. We had some trouble as a group collecting at the bottom because we all came from different places and some were late so it was a scramble up the hill in time for sunset. The rush was worthwhile though because the view was beautiful. The path zigzags up to a restaurant and crowded lookout. Right below on the path though was a pleasant spot to take photos and watch the night creep over the city. I struggled to capture photos with the wide angle camera lens but enjoyed catching up with a friend as the sun set and the cityscape illuminated. Unfortunately we were not able to stay as long as we would have liked because the rest of our party was waiting for us for dinner.
Some days later I was on my own and went up Lofos Strefi which I suspect is an old marble quarry. This is another nearby hill that’s not as high. The view was interesting because I could see the acropolis and to my left was Lycabettus. On an overcast evening where the rain sprinkled, I enjoyed a moment of solitude to listen to music emanating from the trees below. For the time, I enjoyed being alone on the hill above a city of millions. I would later discover it to be a musician in a restaurant hidden behind a rock cropping and under a large tree.
I’ve struggled on this trip to frame my pictures. Part of the reason is that I’m not enjoying the super wide aspect of the 10–18mm lens I have. It is so wide that it visibly distorts the images requiring a lot of post cropping and because of that it looks artificial. It is also the conditions cities are not panoramic landscapes and a tighter crop is more desirable. On the other hand, it could be that these struggles are a reflection of the internal turmoil to perceive the world differently and to be different. Photography in some ways is confirming some of my personal turmoil.
While the cameras has been troublesome, the iPhone remains a dependable with a regular field of view and suitable perspective. It’s easy to use, light, quick to access and always with me. It doesn’t come as a surprise that most people are phone wielding tourists and dslrs are fewer and fewer. Some days I wonder if I should just leave my camera at home. For the blog and Instagram the iPhone is sufficient but I’m always hoping for a special moment that would be worthy of a large print.

Athens is an unequivocal dump.
I had illusions of Athens being similar to Thessaloniki, so I booked a ticket. Flying in from Corfu on New Years eve was an admittedly strange time to arrive. The airport was clean and modern, the rail connection to the city was descent. At this point I was mildly optimistic about visiting this city. Arriving in Syntagma square and heading a little north along big boulevards and then climbing slightly into a narrow grid network of streets, I found my accommodation.
After checking in to my accommodation. I watched the fireworks from the top of a nearby hill. Something that struck me from the ground level but was far more visible from above was the layer of smog enveloping the city. Pollution levels were on a par with other dirty cities like Sofia, Hanoi and Bangkok. However this is supposed to be a first world European country. I was expecting something more like Rome or Madrid, instead it reminded me more of the grimmy streets of Sofia and I felt I could even of been back in the chaotic streets of Hanoi or Bangkok again.
Immediately after setting out to explore the center on new year’s day, I encountered a large group of drug addicts who had gathered in the morning sun next to a classical building. I saw arms peppered with scars from injecting, others had needle in hand ready to use. As I walked on I quickly forgot the scene i’d just witnessed as I made it to towards Syntagma square in square. Admittedly I had an od impression of the city on Jan 1st as everything was closed and Greek people were at home. But I noticed another homeless drug addict sleeping on a bench in a narrow alley in the center. I was shocked to see his forearm covered in open wounds, it honestly looked like his arm was rotten. I was in such disbelief as to what I had just walked past that I went back to make sure that was indeed what I witnessed. What struck me about this scene was the respectable well dressed people walking past this man or standing just twenty meters away, but being totally oblivious to his plight.
In the subsequent days I walked around more and discovered Athens has a bustling bar and restaurant scene in the center. However outside the center the streets are a mess. Pavements barely exist so people walk in the street. All the streets seem to be coated in a layer of dirt, whether from pollution or something else I don’t know. I stayed in an airbnb where you have to raise and lower a metal security gate, like they have on shops when closed. “It’s to stop the anarchists damaging the building” the host said. In a society where anarchists are so mainstream, it suggests to me a lack of direction.
All in all I had a very bad impression of Athens. How can I enjoy the chaos of the city and the food when you have drug addicts and homeless people suffering horrifically in the center. And the Greek people acting with total indifference. Add on to that the cities dirty disorganised streets and thick atmosphere of pollution, I felt an overall seedy atmosphere. This overrided any quaintness from the neverending ramshackle nature of the shops.
One positive note I will end
on is the Greek peoples hospitality was very impressive as always, it’s just a shame Athens can’t be as impressive.

[Socrates] was so well-disciplined in his way of life that on several occasions when plague broke out in Athens he was the only man who escaped infection. — Diogenes Laertius
In 430 BC, Athens was devastated by plague. We don’t know exactly what caused it but it’s been speculated that it was a form of typhus, typhoid, or possibly smallpox. What happened during the Athenian Plague seems to foreshadow aspects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our own experiences probably also help us to better understand what the ancient Athenians must have been going through. I won’t labour the obvious parallels but rather I’ll just tell the story and mention some comparisons briefly along the way…
The epidemic spread throughout the Mediterranean but Athens, the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the region, was hit hardest of all. Attica, the area encompassing Athens, had a total population of roughly a quarter of a million, including thousands of foreign residents and maybe a hundred thousand slaves. The disease was apparently brought into the Greek port of Piraeus by travellers and merchants, from whence it quickly escalated into an epidemic, tearing through the population of neighbouring Athens.
After the first outbreak began to relent, the Athenians must have breathed a collective sigh of relief. Unfortunately, though, there were two further major outbreaks of the plague in Athens, occurring in 429 and 427…

Interview by Alexander Strecker
The streets (and walls) of Athens have been covered — truly covered — in graffiti for as long as I can remember. As a child visiting from the United States, I didn’t know what to make of these indecipherable tags and scribbles. More broadly, I remember how my feelings about Athens itself were consistently ambivalent. Sometimes I reveled in the city’s chaos; other times I was certain that it was the ugliest place I had ever seen. But as I grew older, and started to travel more widely, Athens’ particularities steadily became more striking to me. Not only did I begin to feel a deep admiration for its flagrant disregard of my opinion, but more specifically, I came to realize how the city’s graffiti contained multitudes. Visiting year after year, a neighborhood walk became many things: a political education (ΕΞΩ ΤΟ ΝΑΤΟ! — NATO, Get Out!); an invaluable source for vocabulary (perhaps best not rewritten here); and finally, a reminder of how a city that always felt both old and new, crumbling yet unchanging, could be the site of ongoing struggle and reinvention. Today, I see these tags and murals as inextricable components of the city’s fabric, as much as the venerated antiquities or devilish topography.
For the multi-disciplinary artist Alexandros Simopoulos, graffiti has also been a near-constant presence in his experience of living and making work in Athens. As early as high school, graffiti served as a creative outlet for Alexandros, establishing an underlying layer that he would later return to and cover over, again and again, in different ways. He continued to produce work while a student in university — where he focused on humanitarian law and international relations, both of which would also express themselves in his artistic work — but still, he could not get graffiti out of his mind. After university, he was once more drawn to the art form, producing graffiti-inspired t-shirts, skateboards, and prints. His timing was propitious: street art was having what Alexandros calls, “its second renaissance in Athens” amidst the growing financial crisis. He quickly realized that his adolescent hobby could become so much more.
Alexandros explains, “The story of graffiti and street art is complex and contradictory. Even the very terms of ‘graffiti’ and ‘street art’ have highly contested histories, which continue to generate intense debate inside and outside the community. In Athens, though, this story had a local twist during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, there were endless reports from major international media outlets about street art in the Greek capital [for example: How Angry Street Art is Making Athens Hip]. The angle was that there must be some key relationship between the country’s economic situation and the city’s street art. The easy narrative: graffiti as resistance, with its images providing an accessible aestheticization of the country’s problems, such as urban poverty, alongside a manifestation of its ‘brave spirit.’ But very few of these articles undertook any in-depth research; rather, I think graffiti provided a free and edgy illustration for their pieces. The crisis put Greece in the spotlight and street art became a handy example.” He then reveals, with a knowing smile, “I am pretty sure that some artists made political work on certain streets because they knew it would be spotted by journalists and later published in, for example, The International New York Times. Easy narratives can be manipulated by both sides…”

In Athens, though, this story had a local twist during the height of the financial crisis. The easy narrative: graffiti as resistance, with its images providing an accessible aestheticization of the country’s problems. He then reflects, “But what’s important to remember is that there was plenty of street art and political graffiti in Athens before the crisis.”
Yet as the old adage goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity. As Alexandros explains, “Over the past decade, street art has also created tourism for Athens. Many people travel here to paint — or, at least, they used to — we call them ‘graffiti tourists’. In Greece, it’s easy to work outside, especially since making graffiti is not heavily criminalized and the weather is good. The popularity of street art has certainly contributed to the touristification of the Athenian center, for better and for worse. For my generation, it has certainly been for worse: the recent inundation of visitors, and Airbnbs, has outpriced us all when it comes to housing.” He then reflects, “But what’s important to remember is that there was plenty of street art and political graffiti in Athens before the crisis. Additionally, street art has been used for gentrification for quite some time, all over the world, Berlin being a celebrated example (though we see it in London, New York, Barcelona and other places as well). Artists move where there is space and where it is cheap. All of these phenomena are not confined to a few trendy neighborhoods in post-2010 Athens.”
Alexandros understands these complications better than most: he has engaged with the street art community on many levels, at home and, lately, abroad. In Athens, he not only produced his own work, but collaborated with Cacao Rocks, another prominent practitioner [as well as an inaugural SNFA Artworks Fellow], to run a gallery in the city center dedicated to street artists. As he tells me, “Several years ago, Cacao and I shared a studio in the building’s basement. The gallery was on the ground floor. There, we had more or less free rein to do what we wanted. For over three years, we invited people we knew and gave them a welcoming space to experiment with formats. We even flew in artists from abroad to do mini-residencies and exhibit their work, bringing international points of view to Greece. In addition, the gallery worked as a small arts school for the kids of the neighborhood. It was an amazing experience — at its peak, it was a vibrant hub for varied people to meet, collaborate, experiment, and the spark for many new projects. The gallery was at the core of a small street art scene that was growing bigger and bigger. I remember that Cacao and I once had a completely sold-out show — but no matter how many gallery exhibitions we held and no matter how much work we sold, we lived in a parallel world: we were definitely not part of the contemporary art scene in Athens, nor was it something which we were interested in joining at that time.”
As Alexandros looks back on this heady time, I can hear the mixture of pride and frustration that accompanies the position of the perpetual outsider. Being on the edge — whether as a street artist excluded from contemporary art or as an artist living in Athens, a place that remains on the “periphery” of the global art world — affords a great deal of freedom. But it can also be isolating. Regardless, Alexandros reminds me that periphery is always a relative concept. He refers to the example of the 2017 edition of Documenta to underscore how the art world is never monolithic: at every level, there are insiders and outsiders, irreconcilable narratives, and overlapping spectrums of power. He says, “Documenta portrayed Athens as a locality of chaos and crisis and, at the same time, rebirth and self-determination. It was a narrative drawn from many sources, which made it appealing for different people, especially artists. Still, the event ultimately came from the outside, and thus its narrative exoticized Athens. It didn’t, perhaps couldn’t, explore all the complexities contained here.”
Being on the edge — whether as a street artist excluded from contemporary art or as an artist living in Athens, a place that remains on the “periphery” of the global art world — affords a great deal of freedom. But it can also be isolating.
Over the past few years, Alexandros’ own path reveals his efforts to bridge these many competing approaches and gaps — between street and art, politics and space, Greece and abroad. As he tells me, “What’s so special about street art, more than anything, is its directness. It can reach people in their everyday lives. I’m interested in working across worlds, not just speaking to curators and critics. I want to create work that communicates with everyone.” In pursuit of a more legible visual language, Alexandros first left Athens to study illustration and visual arts in London. He then returned, now with a wider focus on making work that deals with the idea of public space — not illegally but as an invited guest. He tells me, “I’m not painting outside much anymore. I don’t even consider myself a street artist at this point. Instead, I am contending with the difference between what I thought I was doing and its perception from the outside. Conceptually, I am thinking about questions such as ‘What happens in your body when you paint graffiti? What happens in your mind? What kind of narratives do you come across, what kind of people, how are they communicated — and how has all of this transformed cities around the world? Concretely, my expanded point of view means I now work with a greater range of people, all of whom have widely disparate perceptions of street art and public space more broadly. Through these interactions, I am exploring my relationship to public spaces from other people’s perspective. I try to actively engage them in the creative process or even make them part of the work.”
As a former student of humanitarian law and international relations, Alexandros’ broadening point of view continues to ripple outward, well outside of Greece. For example, this past summer, he spent three months in Berlin and, prior to that, six months in New Mexico as a Fulbright Fellow. He also received public commissions to paint murals in locations ranging from Hungary to Portugal, and even Greenland. He reflects on the privilege, and challenges, of extending his work in this way. “Traveling creates a global community and network of artists who can exchange skills and ideas. This has always existed in the street art scene — while a piece might not travel, the people who make these public spaces are able to move and bring their knowledge with them to new settings. This does present some complications, though. When I travel to make work, I am confronting a place I’m not from, where I might be unaware of specific tensions or histories. The only way to overcome this deficit is to spend as much time there as possible before making any work and to meet and interact as sincerely as possible with people from different communities. Wherever I go, I try to respond to those around me and make the art meaningful for everyone involved. This has become the most challenging and rewarding part of the process for me.”
“I’m not painting outside much anymore. I don’t even consider myself a street artist at this point. Instead, I am contending with the difference between what I thought I was doing and its perception from the outside.

What kind of narratives do you come across, what kind of people, how are they communicated — and how has all of this transformed cities around the world?”
Alexandros’ new perspective has not only helped him with his work overseas, but to look at Greece with fresh eyes. This was evident in Still Here Tomorrow, the Artworks group exhibition held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation last summer. In the show, Alexandros’ piece effectively juxtaposed views from inside and outside, embodying his desire to understand other points of view while retaining his local roots. The installation, titled Best served old (Anti-austerity artists are impressing the tourists), mixed street art motifs such as pigeons and stray dogs with aesthetics taken from ancient Greek art — red and black-figure vase painting and portrait statuary — as well as the pan-Balkan blue evil eye. According to his artist statement, the entire installation was meant to evoke the pandering displays in tacky souvenir shops. But beneath the dark humor, Alexandros had a positive message. “Many of the images on these ceramics relate to stories of tradition. Tradition in Greece (and elsewhere) has been the basis for countless horrible, nationalistic, and extremely conservative narratives. But, in some instances, it can also point us towards more radical ideas. For example, tradition can help foster a connection to the land, by which I mean the actual soil — something that has become revolutionary again today since it runs counter to so many globalized forces.”
Still, as we discuss how to synthesize such opposing views, it seems fitting that we end our conversation on the subject of land. After all, street artists are ever-rooted to their physical surroundings. And so we conclude by returning to the city of Athens one final time, with Alexandros saying, “In so many places in the West, public space is tightly regulated: you go to your work and after you go to designated places to enjoy yourself in very predetermined ways (bar, restaurant, theater). In between, public space is used only as a passage, with few actions produced there. But in the words Martyn Reed, I like to think of streets as ‘repositories of meaning for those who occupy and move through them, as places of contested perceptions and negotiated understanding.’ We can see this in Athens, where public space is chaotic and put under many competing demands. People, bikes, cars, and café tables fight over finite space. It’s not always pleasant, but I love the plethora of communication that happens in these increasingly squeezed plots of land. It excites me to see Athenians using every bit of public space available to them; you find people everywhere. The city’s residents continue to spend a large amount of time outside, together. Here, there is an intensity of community that I don’t find in other cities in Europe or the United States. For me, that’s the essential quality of Athens, that’s a big part of what makes it special.”

Clearly Athens has been going through it as of late. The 2009 financial crisis and the subsequent underthought austerity measures put in place by the IMF crippled the country’s economy, and hit its capital hard. Due to this, things got cheaper for foreigners, and huge amount of tourists and investors were flooding the place before the COVID pandemic; apparently this improved things a bit, but tourism definitely brings its own headaches. And, as I write this, some of its suburbs just stopped burning.
So yes, Athens is pretty screwed up right now. However, things are bad in the sense that they were in New York in the late 70s, or in East Berlin after the wall came down: this economic suffering has coincided with Athens becoming a rare, rare beast. Rent is cheap, and so is the food (which is, clearly, Greek, a great cuisine); additionally, it’s safe. All this adds up to major appeal for a certain group: artists.
On the streets, the graffiti scene is very, very strong: by many accounts, Athens is an urban gallery (there’s a documentary about the scene, albeit from 2014, here). It’s also an amazing place for skateboarding, with a grip of skate spots and its hilly terrain, which has provided the skate community with a lot of videos and travel writeups about the place. On the other side of the coin, there…

Monastiraki square — another very central area of Athens.
Athens is an absolutely marvelous place, no doubt about it. We thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit and definitely plan on going back at some point in the future. Nonetheless, it is not a perfect place. No place in the world is. I have alluded to the three sides on our postcard post, but l will delve into it a little more. As tourists, we often gloss over the great parts of a place and rarely see the true local side of said place. It’s understandable, after all, you’re on vacation and world problems should not be on your mind. Regular readers know l try to present what l see in all its glory, and crappiness, This will be no exception. I present to you our observations of the amazing city.
Syntagma square is one of Athens top tourist attractions, where it all happens…both good and bad!
Athens is the capital of Greece with a population of just over 11 million people, so yes…very crowded. The heart of the city is Syntagma (Constitution) Square. It is definitely the most famous part of Athens. It is a lively part of town. The Parliament building is located here. Once upon a time, it used to be the King’s Palace. Built between 1836 and 1840 by King Otto, who had daddy (Ludwig I of Bavaria) pay for it. Fun fact: The original plan had been to build the King’s palace on the Acropolis! Thank god it never came to pass. Can you imagine tearing down that history to put up a dime a dozen palace? Syntagma Square is where all the protests and parties (New Year’s Eve etc) happens. Among the government buildings, there are tons of shops and cafes.
Athens sightseeing: Parliament House Syntagma square Athens — the changing of the guards should be on your Athens itinerary.
Here’s a video l did on the changing of the guard, a fun thing to see in Athens. Sorry for the shaky hand in the beginning, but l rarely do this :-). I love how they imitate the movement of horses.
What to do in Athens : Try both Traditional and otherwise food and expand your palette.
It is hard not to eat well. The food is hearty and delicious. We had lots of really good traditional food. We had an amazing foodie tour and we sampled lots of coffee drinks that we enjoyed thoroughly.
Some of the yummy goodies we hate. I have had my fill of Greek salads for a while though :-)
I have never been a huge fan of drinking to excess or pub crawling, but l do enjoy a good glass of wine or cocktail. The area of Athens we stayed at, called Psyrri, is a bohemian and artsy neighborhood. About a 20–30 minute walk from Syntagma square. Iroon square, which is the very heart of the neighborhood, has tons of eateries with live music, and lots of bars. I mean bars with proper tables and chairs with dark interiors and great music. I confess l don’t know what they become after 11 or so because l am in bed :-), but during the day, they are wonderful to hang out in. Some had Greek music, some jazz, my favorite were the ones with bossa nova music. We actually went pub crawling, going from one to the next, having coffee drinks (mostly Federico) and cocktails (mostly me). Absolutely loved it.
Simple, good food. Stewed meat and white rice. We found a little place run by a girl and the grandmother with an all Greek menu and l just explained that l wanted something simple and she gave me this. I was licking the bowl :-)
Non touristy things to do in Athens :-) . So many cool cafes and bars to sit, people watch and listen to good music. I had so many good margaritas too!
If you ever have a chance to eat the orange pie on the right, go for it. It is amazing. The one on the left was like pudding. I didn’t like it, but ate it because the woman insisted on comping us, and l couldn’t be rude! :-)
Visit Athens and try the yummy kinds of food everywhere!
Pork belly, grilled..served with homemade chips. Food sampling is definitely one of the best things to do in Athens. The flavors and spices are awesome.
We found cute little off the wall places to eat, everything from kebabs to gyros. I can’t remember eating anything bad. The fact that the prices were reasonable was an added bonus.
This super friendly guy insisted on Federico taking his picture when he saw the camera and started talking to us.
The people were very friendly, warm and smiled a lot. Everyone was eager to help when we got lost, sometimes even walking us to the metro station. It was pleasant haggling with the traders, they weren’t aggressive like in Marakesh, which was a nightmare for Federico, but fun for me..felt just like home!

Greek mythology is alive and well. Being able to see where it all began is a joy. If you can afford it, I think everyone should visit Athens at least once in their lifetime. Sightseeing in Athens is mind blowing. Places such as the:
Acropolis Athens night view. Amazing sight! The Acropolis is probably one of the top things to do in Greece, if not the top.
You don’t see sights like this ancient columns everyday! Well, unless you’re in Athens Greece of course :-) Part of the Roman Agora in Plaka Athens
Some of the best things to see in Athens include: (Things to do in Athens Greece)
Athens tourist attractions: If you’re looking for Athens tours, we recommend GetYourGuide tours, which we have personally used on our trips.
Places to visit in Athens Greece include the Tower of the Winds in Athens Greece. It has stood at the bottom of the Acropolis for over 2,000 years. It was used by merchants to forecast the weather.
It seems like there is a temple dedicated to every Greek god! :-) . This time around, we didn’t really seek them out much as l’d already visited them on my first trip to Athens.
Things to see in Athens: Great street art that one can appreciate.
Street art depiction of the stray Riot dog Loukanikos who always sided with the protesters against the police. He was actually one of Time magazine’s people of the year 2011. He died in 2014 :-(
This is good stuff :-) . What to do in Greece? definitely look for street art. There are some great ones.
When they’re good, they’re very good. We found some great street art in Athens in the neighborhood of Psyrri, right off the main square. There are some very talented artists.
Athens weather is pretty good year round. There are few days of rain and the average temperature is 84 degrees which is quite nice. August is the hottest month to visit Athens. In the winter, the temperature drops to about 59–62 degrees which is still hot for some. Weather in Greece in October is about 74 degrees and October, along with April seems to be the best times to visit Athens.
The two often go hand in hand l know. It’s hard not to notice the increased number of drug addicts that are in Athens. Eating outside on the sidewalk is a thing in Europe. Neither one of us like this. The sidewalks are often dirty and l hate people passing by peering at my food, dogs sniffing and doing their business or peeing in front of me, and boy..the sidewalks are dirty and stink! (worse in Spain). Probably the biggest reason is my fear of cats! They are freaking everywhere. I will overturn the table if one gets close! :-) Anyway, we prefer to eat inside. Sometimes, depending on how the exterior seating is, we will seat outside and have drinks. This really gave me a chance to observe just how rampant the drug use is. We saw at least 5 separate instances where drug abusers were tweaking and it brought back nasty memories of my pharmacy years. Tweaking is when meth users (tweakers) become unpredictable, paranoid, and might be dangerous, usually at the end of a drug binge. One woman was screaming because she felt something/someone was hurting her, was scratching herself furiously and taking off her clothes as she walked, all her teeth were rotten. A man was trying to calm her down, but he looked almost in the same sad shape. Another time, a man in a red shirt was in a fit, just rolling on the floor and yelling angrily, and went about punching the tree shrubs, he was quite close to the diners. I was a bit scared honestly. I notice though, that the employees come out in full force, to gawk, and also probably to make sure that their clients are not disturbed, which is kind of re-assuring. We didn’t take any pictures because l really don’t care to showcase human despair.
This is just off the main square. You can see the beginning of the sleeping bags, further down, it’s narrower and we walked on the street instead.
I also noticed that quite a few of the cafes feed the homeless. I actually mentioned it to Federico after l saw it a couple of times and we made sure to eat again at the places we noticed did that. The homeless people would stand at a particular spot and wait. When the waitress/waiter had a spare minute, she would bring out food for them, they would take it, and go away..well, all except for this one guy, she gave him a sandwich and he defiantly refused to leave. He just stood there eating. Now, this guy looked like a hobo, matted hair, torn clothes and l’m sure smelled badly. We weren’t very close to him, but l could tell it was disturbing to the nearest diners. She called another waitress who came out and talked to the guy firmly in an angry and raised voice which made him finally leave. It’s so sad to see, and while l feel sorry for them, I just would rather not be exposed to that. If that makes me an cold unfeeling twat, then so be it. I think it’s just a part of everyday life and people just get used to it, but it’s jarring for visitors to Athens.
Lots of fun stores can be found at the flea market. Consider it a must visit in Athens.
I had previously mentioned the high amount of homeless people that were sleeping in the doorways of houses in the area where we stayed. There were also lots of homeless sleeping in the nearby parks. I can only imagine how much worse the refugees have it as this was mostly a locals area. We saw people sleeping during the day in the porticoes just off the beautiful Monastiraki square. I assume the situation is only going to get worse.
This is just bad crappy doodling!
Unfortunately, there’s more crap than good stuff. This was an old historic theater that the government doesn’t have money to fix, refuse to sell it and is left to rot.
When they’re bad, they are simply horrible! Does this look good to anyone except to someone in a drug induced haze? They cover the houses, stores and streets with it. The same can be said for a great part of Spain, and l think it’s terrible too. I’m not sure when defamation became art :-)!
What happens to most of the refugees fleeing war torn countries that end up in Athens? A bleak life with no end in sight. Syntagma square for all its beauty, also has a dark side. A side where these young men turn to prostitution to survive. It’s so disheartening to read these stories. Here is a video that does a better job than me of showing you how things are that l watched recently. These boys are trapped in a world where the only way to survive is to become male hustlers. We were told by both our host and our food guide to stay away from Omonia Square (this article made me aware of that before we arrived) especially at night because it’s ground zero. We took the advice.
A quick Google search will bring you tons of stories on how hard life is for these young boy. It’s a growing problem. When a 16 year old says he wished he could die that very night because he has no future and his advice to future refugees? Don’t come. It’s better to stay and live with the war. They keep getting younger too. We hear about the girls, but the boys are caught up in the same vicious cycle.
Of course you should! The beauty and the history alone should make you want to visit, not to mention the people. Once again, no place is perfect. It’s no different than any city in America with the drug abuse and prostitution. Would you not visit New York because of Times Square? Thankfully, unlike the U.S, the people in Athens don’t carry guns. Tourism, apart from shipping, is the biggest money maker for the country. After a devastating economic downturn, the country is slowly recovering and they need that money. There are so many cities and islands to visit in this diverse country, you’re bound to find someplace you’ll love, like Heraklion , Crete where we spent some time and had a fantastic time. We spent a total of 15 days in Greece on our holiday and are eager for more. Is Athens worth visiting? The answer is a resounding yes! There are so many things to do in Athens.
Where to stay in Athens Greece — We stayed in Pysrri and we really liked it. It is funky, bohemian and artsy. We stayed at this AirBnB studio flat which was very central and had a stunning view of the Acropolis. My only complaint would be the bathroom which is tiny, but apart from that, it was spotlessly clean, had everything you needed. The WiFi was super fast and the A/C was insanely efficient. Feel free to use our referral code to get some $ off your first stay if you’re new to the platform. I don’t know if it’s the best place to stay in Athens, but we really liked it and would stay there again.
Have you been to Athens? or any other part of Greece? What were your observations? Did you see the good, the bad or the ugly side of Athens?

Even the second time that I went to Athens I was totally fascinated!
I am one of those strange people who didn’t only have Latin at school but Ancient Greek as well. It wasn’t because I really wanted to learn that language. Nope, I just completely refused to learn French when I had to decide between those two languages. So I started learning Ancient Green when I was 14.
I think it was in 2004 when we did a two-weeks-trip to Greece with all my class mates that had chosen as well to study Ancient Greek. By bus we went through Austria and Italy to Ancona and took a ship that would bring us over night to Patras. It was so exciting!
The trip obviously included a stop in Athens! We couldn’t leave out the capital of the new and the ancient Greece.
When I was standing at the Acropolis for the second time — 29, two university degrees and living the digital nomad lifestyle- I couldn’t help but seeing my 17 year old me — super blond and a real rebel. I remember well how we were standing in sun, sweating and listing to the tour guide. I could almost see myself standing infront of the Erechtheion — with hurting feet from all the walking, unpatient but curious at the same time.
It was a strange feeling to stand in front of the Parthenon again and to think about what happened since last time 12 years back in time. My last years at school, the 7 years studying at university and my life as a digital nomad, a life of travels and with my work as a travel blogger.
The weekend in Athens after my week on Coboat turned out to make me travel through time twice!
Because at the same time I was trying to remember all the details of what I learned during my studies of Archeology at school and at university where I studied it as a minor subject.
So I was standing at the Acropolis with my dear nomad friends Anca and Adrian and they wanted to know more about the history of this place. It turned out that the signs weren’t really helpful since they wouldn’t explain the technical terms. That’s why I started explaining:
Although the settlements started in the New Stone Age (around 7500 BC), Athens had the time of prosperity just during the Classical Antiquity in the 5th and 4th Century BC. When Socrates and Platon were strolling over the Acropolis, the ago of the philosophers, artists and thinkers.
“Acropolis” means nothing else than “high city” and during the ancient times every city needed to have one. The Acropolis of Athens though became kind of the symbol of all acropolises. That’s why people always think of the Acropolis of Athens if you just talk about the acropolis. It’s World Heritage of the UNESCO.
In the center of attention of the Acropolis of Athens is the most important temple — the Parthenon, the sanctuary of the patron saint and goddess Pallas Athena Parthenos. It got destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC and they Greeks needed to rebuild it. Since then it had a 12 meters statue of Athena, made of gold and ivory. Unfortunately she got destroyed in the 6th Century.
I remember very well how Mister Herr Krauskopf — my Ancient Greek teacher at school — repeated as often as possible:
“Whenever something could lost or destroyed, we still have our dear old friend Pausanias, who is describing in his travel books all the art works and places that he saw — in an extremely detailed manner which is almost bringing them back to life.”
That’s why we know even today how the statue of Pallas Athene in the inside of the Parthenon looked like:
„The statue is created with ivory and gold. On the middle of her helmet is likeness of the Sphinx … and on either side of the helmet are griffins in relief. … The statue of Athena is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory. She holds a statue of Victory that is approx. Four cubits high, and in the other hand a spear; at her feet lies a shield and near the spear is a serpent. This serpent would be Erichthonius. On the pedestal is the birth of Pandora in relief.“
Pausanias
When I am at those kind of places with a lot of history, I can’t help myself but touching the things, closing my eyes and imagining what this column, this wall or this building has seen and lived. I imagine what story from ancient times it would whisper if it could.
I did that in Palenque for example. Between the many trees and the half covered Maya ruins I really needed to do that. Do you know that feeling?
I remembered the entrance to be on the other side. In my memory we have seen the Theatre of Dyonisos in the end and not in the beginning.
I tried to remember what I had learned: The Theatre of Dionysos was the birthplace of theatre in general. This is where the greek tragedies of Sophocles, Aeschylos and Euripides had there premieres. I was telling Anca and Adrian about Dionysos, the god of plays and wine, and about the theatre’s function of the catharsis, a purification.
I translated them es well words like Stoa into understandable English. I couldn’t believe that signs said those terms without explaining the meaning. So everybody knows what a Stoa is? People are supposed to know that it was nothing than a big hall or a walkway surrounded by columns in the very beginning. I explained Anca and Adrian that later the school of Stoicism was founded in the Stoa in Athens wich is why their name derives from the word Stoa. The reason is because they met here talking about their philosophical ideas.That’s why later a Stoa wasn’t only considered a walkway with columns but a school like place to learn and study philosophy.
I simply enjoyed the rest of the Acropolis with the temples, columns and steles and just tried to let this experience sink. That’s why I want to invite you to do the same with showing you the photos.
In the end, just some minutes before it was time to go back to the modern city and to the here and now, I took the time to admire the beautiful view and landscape.
That’s how my trip through the time in Europe’s oldest capital ended and how I got back to the year 2016. In a certain way it was a catharsis in the sense of a purification while seeing a greek tragedy Although I traveled through the time only in my head. Nevertheless I grew a bit in those few hours!
Did you ever travel through time while being on the road? I am looking forward to your answers!
P.S.: if you liked this article, have a look at the Barbaralicious publication or my blog at Barbaralicious.com (in German as well as in English). A like or comment also helps me a lot in keeping track on what you — my readers like! I hope you have an amazing day and enjoy your next travels.

The Story of the World’s Greatest Civilization
My fascination with Greek culture started in middle school. I don’t remember much from that time of my life, but I do remember the weeks we spent learning about Greek mythology. The Titans. The Gods. The Olympians. The Greeks.
That led me to Rick Riordan and one of the best book series’ I’ve ever read: Percy Jackson. Those books, and the topic of the Greek gods, were what interested me in reading, and writing for that matter. I have a draft sitting in my room of a 50,000-word Greek mythology novel. It’s not good, but I’m getting closer to scratching that itch. For whatever reason, I am drawn to the Greeks and the mythology that was created.
From there it was books from the likes of Madeline Miller and the stories of Odysseus and Achilles. Late last year I read a book from Christopher McDougall (famous for writing Born to Run) called Natural Born Heroes. The book jumped all over the place, but its central plot was about the Greek Island Crete during World War II. The stores, and the characters in them, read like a Greek tragedy. It read like a story in the Iliad or the Odyssey.
This book re-sparked my interest in the Greeks. My interest shifted away from the mythology of the Greeks to the culture of the Greeks. How is it, more than 2,000 years later, we still read and learn from that ancient civilization? I became more interested in what our modern day societies have taken from the Greeks. Reading The Perfect Mile made me reflect on the Olympic Games and how that was made famous because of the Greeks.
I started to dig deeper and found this book my Anthony Everitt. He specializes in these ancient cultures, having already read a few of his Rome books. This book, The Rise of Athens, at more than 400 pages was daunting, but I was surprised at how willing I was to come back to the book each time I put it down.
For the book you are going to have to enjoy Greek culture. But more than that, you are going to have to be interested in the beginning foundations of Greece. The mythology that surrounds its founding is blended in reality and even the great historians like Plutarch don’t differentiate the two.
The book focused on the politics and wars. It chronicled the rise of democracy and the Persian and Peloponnese wars. It brought the Hellenic world to life.
It was a difficult book to read. Almost all of it went over my head. Most of my enjoyment came from knowing even one or two of the characters (outside of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle).
The book focused on the creation of democracy, Greek warfare, life in the Mediterranean in the fourth-century. It examined the architecture and cultural center of Athens and its vast difference from Sparta.
Though the book was a bit more advanced for me, or at least of my understanding of the Greek world during this time, the ideas and information I did understand was valuable. The book was called the Rise of Athens, the Story of the Worlds Greatest Civilization. The objective of Everitt was to answer the question of how Athens became that Great civilization. Unless I missed a whole lot, after reading, Athens really didn’t seem all that great. The democracy lasted less then 200 years and were conquered by Alexander the Great shortly after.
The power of this book is that I have the ability to read the words of these ancient leaders. These are the same words that leaders from the time of Alexander the Great through the founding fathers of America have read. It’s little wonder America looks so similar to Greece and Rome. It’s because those men who created this government were so enamored with those cultures. They breathed new life into them in the creation of America. Understanding our founding, but also the founding of a lot of the knowledge we have built upon today, was worth the effort of this book.

Latest developments
On December 7, 2023, Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan made his first visit to Athens since 2017. He and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis focused the landmark visit on promoting a positive vision for the future of the bilateral relationship. Both parties signed the “Athens Declaration on Friendly Relations and Good-Neighborliness,” a non-binding document listing a cooperation agenda that ranges from encouraging mutual economic activity to minimizing military tension. This meeting stands in stark contrast to President Erdogan’s last visit to Greece in 2017, when he openly called for revising the Lausanne Treaty.
There is no issue between us that is unsolvable. So long as we focus on the big picture and don’t end up being like those who cross the sea and drown in the river.
President Erdogan after meeting with Greek PM Mitsotakis in Athens.
Context
The six years since the last meeting between a Greek Prime Minister and President Erdogan have seen Ankara escalate tensions to historic levels, particularly in the Aegean Sea, where Turkey openly questions Greek sovereignty, and Turkish fighter jets engaged in an unprecedented number of violations of Greek airspace and overflights — many times armed — over inhabited Greek islands. In a ten month span in 2022, Turkey committed 8,880 Greek airspace violations. This is the culmination of a decades long policy whereby Turkey has tried to depict the Aegean as a disputed area. In doing so it has questioned the sovereignty of Greece’s islands in the Aegean, while maintaining a casus belli — threat of war — should Greece exercise its rights under international law and extend its maritime boundaries to 12 nautical miles as spelled out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Other issues such as the status of religious minorities in both countries and Turkey’s disagreement with Greece over current international conflicts are also sources of tension, but the Aegean Sea remains at the heart of tensions between the two countries.
Expert analysis
At this meeting, the existence of [the maritime space] difficulty was acknowledged, and the leaders said we have agreed to disagree for now, and it is civilized and good for us to be able to stomach our disagreements without being acrimonious. And that’s a step — for Greece and Turkey, that’s a step forward.
John Psaropoulos, independent journalist and Al Jazeera Southeastern Europe correspondent
The Greek Current, “Mitsotakis and Erdogan commit to ‘calm waters’ in the Aegean,” Dec 8, 2023
The big picture
Whether Erdogan’s apparent change of heart is a good faith attempt at rapprochement remains to be seen. In the last decade alone he has gone from close US ally to having Congressmen suggest Turkey should be expelled from NATO. His swift and polar policy shifts on Russia, Israel, and Armenia suggest that he prioritizes short-term gains when it comes to foreign relations. However, to appear in Athens and agree not to discuss the tense issues, opting instead to focus on improving the relationship, is an overall positive. While Turkey has everything to gain from cooperation with neighbors and NATO allies, Greece and the international community should approach his olive branch with careful acceptance, implementing an approach reminiscent of that President Ronald Reagan took with the USSR: “Trust, but verify.”

Here’s what you need to know if you’re thinking about taking on a real bucket-list marathon race and running the original, Athens Authentic Marathon!
A year later than initially planned, I got to run the 38th Athens Authentic Marathon. It’s known as the ‘Authentic Marathon’ as it follows the fabled route of Greek messenger Philippides, who ran to the town of Marathon and back to Athens to bring news of a Greek battle victory against Persia, dying after he’d relayed the news.
Gladly, I only ran this route one-way and I’m still alive to tell the tale, so if you’re thinking about running the Athens Authentic Marathon in the future, here’s what you can expect.
You’ll discover to expect at the expo, how the race unfolds on the day and an overview my own race strategy that brought me a new personal best and my first ever time qualifier result.
But first, let’s get started by looking at the pre-race organisation.
The first thing you’ll notice when you start to check-out the information online about the Athens Authentic Marathon is that the quality is rather poor.
The Athens Authentic Marathon website is dated and doesn’t work well on mobile. The content is also usually out of date, with information about previous runnings easily available but little to nothing about the upcoming event. It also doesn’t help that there are several other events that share the same website, so you’ll frequently find information about the half marathon, 10k and 5k races taking place around the same time as the marathon.
It’s rather frustrating.
The social media accounts aren’t much better. They’re basically dormant until a few weeks before the race, then burst into action covering all the ribbon-cutting, permit-acquiring activities runners really couldn’t care less about. Like the website, the socials were also extremely poor.
But, on the day of the Athens Authentic Marathon itself, the organisation was perfect.
I took one of the coaches to Marathon departing from Syntagma and had zero problems. There must’ve been 20–30 coaches lined up, and when the front coach was full (or full-ish) it pulled away.
After arriving at the starting point in Marathon, it was a short walk to the stadium and a 90-minute wait until the race got underway. So as on-the-day organisation goes, there was zero anxiety. It’s just a shame that level of organisation and reassurance wasn’t present on the website and socials in the build up to the race.
This was the first Athens Authentic Marathon since COVID-19 struck so unsurprisingly there were changes from previous runnings and additional protocols in place.
At the time of running, Greece was experiencing a surge in COVID-19 case numbers so everywhere you went shops and restaurants were very hot on mask-wearing and COVID-19 certificates to prove you’re either fully vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 or have a recent negative COVID-19 test (even to the extent of having to show a vaccine certificate and wear a mask to enter a cheap souvenir store!). At the marathon expo, you had to show your vaccine status (or other acceptable status) to enter, and you had to wear a mask while you were inside.
Masks had to be worn on the coach from Athens to Marathon on the day of the race, and the coaches left sufficient room for social distancing by departing when they were probably around 60% full.
Marathon Stadium is all open air, so there was no need to wear masks while you were there, and this year there was a staggered start over two ‘races’ and eight waves, which gave space between blocks of runners. That said, the start wave had zero social distancing and even with the best attempts of the marshals, not everyone maintained a safe distance while waiting for the starting pistol…
And speaking of waves, each wave set off about three minutes after the previous one, so as I was in Wave 3, I was over the start line by about 09:06.
I was running with a friend who was much faster than me and he was placed in Wave 1. There was a lot of very strict communication about not being able to change waves, but we managed to get it sorted at the expo so he could start with me in Wave 3. Apparently, your timing chip was calibrated to activate according to your wave start time, so, if you started in a different wave, your time wouldn’t be recorded.
Overall, the COVID-19 arrangements felt safe and proportionate and in line with what everyone else was doing in Greece at the time.
The Athens Marathon expo — known as the Ergo Marathon Expo — is located at the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre (previously known at the Taekwondo Centre). It’s south of the city on the coast and makes for a nice day out to watch the sailing after you’ve collected your bib.
As the expo was a straight line walk from our apartment, we decided to take an easy stroll to the exhibition centre, which was about 4km away and all downhill. It was a lovely walk and excellent weather, but when we saw the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre we literally ran out of road — several busy motorways and lots of excavation sat between us and the expo hall with no obvious way of crossing them.
We ran into a group of Greek guys who were also on their way there, but even they didn’t know which way to go! After about a kilometre detour, we eventually ended up on the correct side of the motorways and got into the expo after showing our vaccine certificates.
Picking up our race packs was quick and easy, you just had to show your confirmation email and photographic ID. We also managed to sort running in the same wave together, which was also very easy. My friend had the back of his bib signed and stamped to show he’d been approved to run in a different wave, while his registration was updated as well so that his timing chip would work in Wave 3.
The expo offerings were pretty good, with two floors of stalls and very well attended, even if the official marathon stall was pretty small (about 30sq m) and running low on stocks of small and medium merchandise.
We spent around 45 minutes at the expo, which was enough, then grabbed some lunch before heading back into the City Centre.
On race day, it was a fairly early start as the coaches to Marathon began leaving from various points throughout Athens at 05:30, with the last coach scheduled to depart around 06:15. There were dozens of coaches lined up near Syntagma where we boarded our coach, so it was very quick and easy to get on the transport.
And even though it was before sunrise on a Sunday, the Greek parliament guards were still doing their routines, and with only a handful of runners around it was an excellent opportunity to take photos or a short video!
On the coach, there was an information tape playing, explaining in Greek and English what to expect, as well as giving a little history behind the race. So by the time you reached Marathon about 45 minute later, you’re fully briefed and raring to go.
Marathon Stadium is the ‘start village’ for the race and is virtually all outdoors. There is a small indoor area at the back, but unless you were queuing for toilets you were ‘strongly advised’ to go outside (COVID, and everything…).
The stadium itself is a bit run down but there was plenty of room, and if you arrived early enough, you could get a cheeky Strava Segment in round the running track.
There were dozens of toilets and portaloos everywhere round the stadium, so you never had to queue long for the toilet (although some did… while others decided to go al fresco…). Free water and bananas were available so you could keep fluid and carb levels topped up.
The Olympic Flame is also at Marathon Stadium, and if you time it right you can go and hold the torch. Unfortunately, we were in our start pen by then so could only look on in envy.
Running the Athens Marathon requires planning for three very different sections, which I’ll refer to as the First Half, the Hill and the End Bit. While it frustrated me a lot planning my race strategy, as conventional wisdom is to run even or negative splits that just aren’t feasible on this course, it made for a very exciting race in the end.
And don’t read the map left-to-right like a lot of people mistakenly do — the route starts in the east and heads south then west into Athens, not the other way round!
The Athens Authentic Marathon has one of the highest elevation gains of any major international marathon, with a total of 332m (1,089ft) elevation gain across its 26.2 miles. Most of that elevation gain comes in a brutal 8-mile section that begins about halfway through the race and continues relentlessly until you pass kilometre marker 31 (about 19.5 miles in).
But the good news is that the rest of the race — the End Bit — is virtually all downhill, including one of the most charitable last 800m I’ve ever experienced at a race.
After the 5km mark there are water stations every 2.5km in line with international race standards, as well as frequent toilet stops and aid stations. So from a provisions perspective, it was extremely well appointed.
The first half of the Athens Authentic Marathon is pretty much flat. There are a couple of minor climbs, but these only last for a few hundred metres, so they can be safely taken at a constant pace.
After leaving Marathon Stadium the route is fairly straight, save for a dog-legged detour about 5km around the Marathon Tomb. On the wide-open road — made less congested by the staggered start waves — it was easy to find a comfortable pace and lock it in, following the blue racing line as closely as I could.
I even made a friend during this section, getting to chat to a Greek guy who was aiming for a similar finish time to me. So it was nice to be able to chat while grinding down the miles.
The support through this section is sporadic as the setting is quite rural, but when you run through a village there’s a massive surge in energy as the whole place seemed to be out supporting the runners. There were also children and ladies handing out olive twigs for luck, so I took a small one and stuffed it into my pocket. It was a unique souvenir for a finish line selfie!
About halfway, The Hill starts. I clocked it starting at 13.5 miles, and it went on for the next 8 miles with only a couple of short sections flattening out a little.
I was nervous about The Hill, even though I’d trained on a lot of hills back home and had simulated an 8-mile, 180m (580ft) elevation gain run a few weeks earlier. But I’d never attempted something like this after running a fairly pacy (for me!) half marathon beforehand.
My coach had recommended I do ‘something’ while running up the hill to take my mind off it. ‘Counting to four’ and ‘pretending to click pens with my thumbs’ were two techniques he suggested had been shown to take the mind off pain, so I planned to give them a go. The ‘count to four’ suggestion fit well with a breathing technique Jack Daniels, PhD recommends of using two strides to breathe out and a two strides to breathe in.
So I applied the ‘count to four’ and breathing technique for a good part of The Hill, but also took the opportunity to learn a bit of Greek from my Greek running friend. I learned how to say ‘thank you’ (‘Efharisto’ or Ευχαριστώ) and tried it out on the crowds, with him correcting my terrible pronunciation so I could try again later.
I think I got it in the end!
For all the worry I had about The Hill beforehand, it turned out to be absolutely manageable. My highest elevation gain over one mile was 138ft (42m), but most miles had an elevation gain of just 50–60ft (15–18m).
My race strategy worked a treat through this section and I was actually ahead of schedule by the time The Hill ended at kilometre marker 31… but not before the most brutal segment, where you run down — and then back up — a motorway fly-under, which was a killer. But once you’re over the top, the road bends to the left and you can see it’s all downhill from now on.
At this point in the race, more than 20 miles in and knowing the hardest part was probably over, it was a bizarre feeling. But I’d had some sage advice from people who’d ran the Athens Authentic Marathon before, who told me:
Don’t put your foot down too quickly after the top of The Hill as many people who do this end up collapsing
After running uphill for so many miles, the sudden change in terrain puts a strain on different muscle groups as you head downhill, and for many people their knees just give way, and they collapse. After running so closely to my race plan up until this point, the last thing I wanted was to put my foot down too hard and fall over, so I gave it half a mile or so before increasing my pace.
The End Bit isn’t all downhill, there are flat sections and a sneaky incline just before the final turn, but the support really ramps up to cheer you on. Entering Athens was an incredible buzz, with massive support either side of the course and a lot more cheer stations as well.
And after that last turn, it’s another downhill segment straight into the Panathenaic Stadium and finish line. This must be one of the most charitable ends to any race I’ve ever ran as you can give it all you’ve got left without worrying about making it up another hill or round a tight bend.
It was fantastic!
And ending in the Panathenaic Stadium — location of the first Modern Olympic Games in 1896 — really is something to behold. And you’ll want your best smile/ grimace on as you enter the stadium as the finish straight is littered with photographers snapping away at your sprint finish.
Then it’s time to grab your medal — the 38th running has a fabulous double-sided medallion with Philippides on one side and the Panathenaic Stadium track on the other.
I can honestly say this race is up there with the very best, a cracking course and an exceptional finish line. I’d do it again without hesitation!
Coming back to my race strategy, I’d pondered it for months as The Hill means you must adapt your race plan from what would be considered ‘best practice’. Running even splits isn’t possible on this course as the elevation changes so vastly, while keeping your powder dry for later in the race seems like a waste considering the first half is flat as a pancake and you’ve got the benefit of miles of downhill segments at the end to sweep you through to the finish line.
My target was a Chicago Marathon time qualifier time, so I needed to come in sub-3:20.
I’d also ran a PB in a virtual marathon the previous year in 3:18, so my goals for Athens were to nail a Chicago Marathon time qualifier spot and, if possible, chalk up a new personal best. This meant my goal pace was about 7:34 mins/ mile over the marathon distance, but even splits were out of the question due to the 180m (560ft) of elevation on the 8-mile stretch of The Hill.
I didn’t know how much The Hill was going to take out of me, so I set a pace range for the last 5–6 miles, knowing if I was in that ballpark I’d hit my goal.
My race strategy looked like this:
· First Half: 7:00 mins/ mile
· The Hill: 7:30 to 7:45 mins/ mile
· The End Bit: whatever I had left in the tank, but as close to 7:00 mins/ mile as I could manage
This left quite a bit of wiggle room at the end as I knew I’d tire but didn’t know by how much.
The First Half went 100% to plan, I maintained a steady 7:00 mins/ mile throughout (even having to pull back my pacer friend at times to stop me from running too fast!) and hit The Hill bang on target.
To my utter amazement, The Hill turned out to be a lot kinder than I’d anticipated. I managed to hold a 7:20 mins/ mile pace for large portions of it, slowing only to 7:45 mins/ mile for the really steep sections, which were thankfully few and far between.
And for the End Bit, I managed to pull back to 7:00 mins/ mile for a couple of miles before fatigue set in and I dropped back to 7:30 mins/ mile. But hitting that last 800m downhill home stretch I accelerated to 6:45 mins/ mile to cross the finish line, which shows you just how charitable that last segment is!
I finished in a time of 3:08:31, way ahead of both my goals. My time was also a Boston Qualifier time and would’ve got me into the 2022 running but unfortunately the Athens Authentic Marathon was 48 hours after the close of the Boston Marathon qualifying period.
But there’s always another chance to improve my time and get that BQ next year!
I can honestly say this was one of the best races I’ve ever experienced. The course was incredible, gave you lots to think about and was an energising mix of quieter segments followed by raucous support as you ran through the towns and villages — and then Athens itself.
If this race is on your bucket list, I’d highly recommend signing up and living your dream.
You won’t be disappointed!

Airbnb has effectively created a new category of rental housing. This new category — called ‘short-term rentals’ — exemplifies a software-driven, platform-mediated market that occupies the gap between traditional residential rental housing and hotel accommodation.
A prime example of the corporate sharing economy, the American company operates an online marketplace and — with nearly 5 million listings in 81,000 cities and over 300 million check-ins — it has established itself as the world’s largest peer-to-peer hospitality intermediary. Guests benefit from the ease of use, decent rates, access to peer reviews, and a variety of housing options in neighborhoods not traditionally geared to tourism. Hosts benefit from the access to a huge audience, flexible living arrangements, and a steady flow of extra income in these times of economic crisis.
Nonetheless, Airbnb’s impact on cities and housing markets is not immediately obvious.
On the positive side, the company claims that the short-term rental market increases tourism and its economic benefits. It also provides additional income for hosts, particularly those who would not otherwise rent out their housing unit or rooms to longer term tenants, while benefiting neighborhoods that tourists traditionally do not visit, bringing additional customers to local businesses.
On the negative side, local communities and housing advocates point out that Airbnb is making it easier to illegally rent out apartment units to tourists, while taking those units off the market for full-time residents and driving housing costs higher, negatively affecting the quality of life in residential areas.
Accordingly, hotel associations are concerned that short-term rentals function as hotels but have an unfair advantage because they don’t pay taxes and violate safety and zoning regulations.
Attempts to regulate Airbnb, however, have encountered a significant pushback from the company, which summons a powerful weapon through disruptive business and lobbying strategies and by mobilising its community to protest proposed reforms and expand its political influence. While Airbnb and its defenders insist that these reforms must be updated to accommodate the new possibilities presented by the sharing economy, its opponents argue that Airbnb aims to avoid regulation and taxation, and threatens affordable housing in cities.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, was founded in 2008 as a way for people to easily list and rent out their spare rooms or their homes online. There has been a widespread concern, however, that a large amount of the activity on Airbnb is not ‘home sharing’, but rather a new form of de facto hotel that fuels gentrification and displacement.
In response to this concern, I set out to find how Airbnb is really being used in and affecting the Greek capital.
To understand the impact of Airbnb on housing in Athens, I downloaded and analysed a dataset compiled by the independent, non-commercial monitoring service Inside Airbnb, which tracks the flow of ads on the online platform.
The data covers the city centre of the Athens urban area, the largest in Greece and one of the most populated urban areas in Europe, sprawling across the central plain of Attica. The study period is May 26, 2009 — May 9, 2017, and every Airbnb listing which existed at any point in this period in the city centre of the Athens urban area has been included in the analysis.
In 2017, there were 5,127 listings reserved at least once on Airbnb in Athens — a 6.8% increase from the previous year (4,801 listings), and a 56.5% increase from 2015 (3,275 listings).
It is not the case that there are 5,127 listings receiving reservations, but rather the fact is that, on average, half of the listings available in Athens in a given month receive at least one review from a guest.
Serving as the glue of the community, reviews can be used as an indicator of Airbnb activity. This metric lets hosts or guests to leave a detailed review of their experience. Receiving a positive review from a guest is absolutely vital for a host to have more reservations and they usually encourage guests to leave a review. According to Niels van Doorn, Assistant Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam and Principal Investigator of the Platform Labor research project, “such ratings have become a major decentralized and scalable management technique that outsources quality control to customers of on-demand platforms, creating a generalized audit culture in which service providers are continually pushed to self-optimize and cater to the customer’s every whim.”
Indeed, serious Airbnb entrepreneurs may well refurbish their units to increase their success with the service. But still, the only necessary step for converting a long-term rental to a short-term one and for scoring quick money through Airbnb is just to evict the existing tenants, or not replace them when they depart.
Before proceeding, let’s remind ourselves that helping each other out by sharing our rooms or houses is one thing while commodifying them by charging a fee for their use is quite another. And this leads us to the more innovative aspect of the sharing economy, which is to disturb our material reality; according to author and critic Sebastian Olma, “to coordinate supply and demand of products and services that in their present form were previously unavailable on the market;” in our case, to allow people to sublet their houses.
It seems quite obvious, then, that, despite Airbnb’s outreach focus on small scale and occasional uses of its platform (the way, for example, that homeowners can pay their household regular expenses by hosting guests occasionally), most regulatory scrutiny of short-term rentals has been focused on entire homes or apartments. Of course, this scrutiny is not just limited to the room types in a given area — especially when it comes to Athens, where most of the listings are entire homes or apartments — but it is also extended to a listing’s availability and activity.
An Airbnb host can setup a calendar for their listing so that it is only available for a few days or weeks a year, while other listings are available all year round. Depending on its availability and activity, a home converted to full-time Airbnb use could be more like a hotel, disruptive for neighbors, taking away housing, and thereby fuelling gentrification across the city.
Yes, 91.6% of the Airbnb listings in Athens are available for more than 60 days a year. Keep in mind that the calculation of availability for each listing through insideairbnb.com tracks whether a listing is reported as available or unavailable on its calendar. This approach does not differentiate booked from unavailable properties, which means that the statistics could have underestimated the availability of properties.
Short-term rentals may also impact the housing shortage in Athens by offering a more lucrative alternative or a more flexible living arrangement to listing a unit on the long-term rental market.
With an average price of €55 per night across Athens, it would not be a hustle for some landlords to evict a tenant for the financial benefits of entering the sharing economy, right? The essence of sharing, however, does not involve the exchange of money. Again, sharing only happens in the absence of market transactions.
This is why the image of a family occasionally renting a spare room in their home, or perhaps renting their entire home for a brief period of time while they are out of town, is not representative of Athens anymore (as if it ever was).
But how can we distinguish commercial from occasional operators?
One way to do this is to look at hosts who have multiple listings on Airbnb. By definition a commercial operator is a host with more than one entire home listing, since only one of their listings could be their primary residence.
Estimating commercial operators this way will dramatically underestimate their numbers, since it will fail to identify hosts who have a single listing which is not their primary residence and which they run as a business. It will also fail to identify hosts who operate their listings via multiple Airbnb accounts. It is a useful first approximation though.
A ‘multi-listing’ is, thus, defined as an entire-home listing whose host has at least one other entire-home listing, or a private-room listing whose host has at least two other private-room listings.
Commercial operators that control multiple entire-home/apartment listings or large portfolios of private rooms are a 43.8% of hosts in Athens.
Here’s the top 10 of them for 2017:
Most discussion of Airbnb’s impact on housing availability and affordability focuses on entire-home listings and for good reason. These are the listings which, if rented sufficiently often throughout the year, can no longer be housing a long-term tenant. Private room listings, by contrast, are generally assumed to have little if any impact on housing markets, since they generally do not displace renters.
If we look at groupings of private rooms rented by a single host in the same building, or in what the Canadian housing advocacy group Fairbnb has called ‘ghost hotel’, this assumption is clearly false.
Most ghost hotels in Athens comprise 2 to 5 private-room listings. The most striking fact about Athens’ ghost hotels, apart from simply their existence, is that one of them has 40 private-room listings and that it is a real hotel.
Among others, ghost hotels in Athens include:
I have noticed that when there is a discussion involving affordable housing and Airbnb in Athens, someone will come forward and reference Koukaki as the #1 exclusive AirBnB zone in the city. Almost true, given the small size of the area.
Following the neighborhoods of Plaka and Exarchia, Koukaki ranks third on the Airbnb chart of Athens with 343 listings, and fifth on Airbnb’s top 16 neighborhoods to visit in 2016, with 801% growth from 2015.
FYI: at the time of this writing, there are only 65 apartments available in Koukaki on www.xe.gr, the leading long-term rental platform in Greece.
As you might wonder, ‘#1 Event Venue In Athens | Acropolis View 360°!!!’ is the reason why Kerameikos is the most expensive neighborhood in Athens.
With an average price of €85 per night, Plaka ranks as the #2 most expensive neighborohood in the short-term rental market of Athens, followed by Pentagono, Rigillis, and Zappeion with €81, €75, and €74 per night respectively. I was hoping to see Kolonaki in the top 5, but it’s just #6 with €72,4 per night on average.
Taking those metrics one step further, the map below illustrates the distribution of all 5,127 Airbnb listings in the city centre of the Athens on May 9, 2017. Each circle represents a listing. The size of the circle is the listing’s price per night, and the colour is the room type.
Lastly, let’s take a closer look at the 5 neighborhoods with the greatest concentration of Airbnb listings in Athens.
Hopefully this data adds a bit more evidence to the discussion around the dominance of Airbnb in Athens and how it has become a symbol for quick value extraction. Now, the question is: How can we make the transition from a corporate consumer-driven to a citizen-centric sharing economy?
I’d love to hear your examples of non-profit, community-based alternatives and how they support forms of exchange that could actually be called sharing.
Notes on methodology
I initially became interested in exploring the dominance of Airbnb in Athens after discovering Inside Airbnb’s dataset, and settled on this methodology after coming across UPGO’s analysis of Airbnb in New York zip codes.
Once I isolated the names of each neighborhood in Athens, I queried the dataset to search each neighborhood for available Airbnb listings (focusing on the three available room types), their hosts, availability, and price/night, among others. Using the lat/long coordinates for each listing, I mapped each listing to its neighborhood. All code is written in Python.

“What is the city but its people?”
Choosing a travel destination is always hard. There are in the world so many places to explore and to make yours, that the choise can be even hard to explain when you say to people: “I am leaving for X-city and I will stay there for Y-days”.It is even more difficult to define, once we come back from our journey, what really fascinated and attracted us during our time spent away from home, what actually hit our eyes and heart.
My wanderlust brought me to pick the capital city of Greece for my end of May’s trip, as I wanted to follow the roots of wise men I studied during my school years such as Heracitus, Herodotus, Pisistratos, Pericles, Homer, Socrates, Aristotle and many others, and to discover the origins of the modern western civilation and democracy set by the Greeks around the V century BC. And indeed the mission was accomplished.
There are many things we discuss with with our friends and relatives once we come back from a journey. The most common topics concern sightseeings, architecture, landscapes, food, activities, hotel,… All aspects related to how the place we have been has met our expectations and likes. The magic of a city, according to me, has a lot to do with the people we meet on our journey. It is indeed in this aspect that I found the city extremely attractive and fascinated, i.e. how people live their lives in the city, how much they contribute to give a special vibe and influence to their city life and how much they care about your personal opinion about their city. Even if we do not know anybody in the city we travel to, people seem to be the first attraction: how they behave, how they live, how and what they eat, what traditions they may have; all these points make the inhabitant of the city we visit special, as people give a place athmosphere, energy, identity and spirit.
I had the chance to meet spontaneosly several locals throughout my cityscape. People were spontaneously approaching me while I used to sit in bars in Plaka drinking coffee and writing my travel diary; some were even greeting me on the streets with a very warm “Kalimera”, some others were interested in knowing where I was from, what I was writing on my open diary, why I decided to visit their city,…
But even before flying to Athens, I got in touch with Alexander, a very friendly Athenian guy graduated in archeology and member of an association called “This is my Athens”. The following association does not only give tips to tourists about activities to do in Athens day and night, but provides also the chance to meet local people willing to show with their own eyes the city by bringing you around for an entire day for free.
Alexander was the greatest person I met during my trip. He did not only show me the Acropolis, Plaka, the Arch of Adrian, Syntagma Square and other highlights of Athens; he did not only brush up my previous knowledges of ancient Greek history, art, philosophy and culture, but he also showed me what he likes the most of his city: the encounter between ancient and modern, between the ancient myth and the need of modernisation and creativity Athens is experiencing today. The contrast of this gathering between ancient and modern is remarkable in Athens. It would normally disturb my outward eye while looking at the landscape. On the contrary, the day I climbed Lofos Filopappou, the Hill of the Muses, I felt a shiver of inspiration and beauty pervading my chest that I had to sit on a stone to write as follows:
“… The encounter between the Ancient and the Modern makes this city epic, as if myth, philosophy, comedy and tragedies are still echoeing in a neverending ballad with people in T-shirt filming the whole play with smartphones”.
Athens is mythical. Athens is legendary in every corner you explore. Myth and legend are witnessed not only by the majestity of the Acropolis itself, but also in its every corner by temples, columns in marble, arches and statues of ancient times. These remind all travellers of the epic past of the Greek civilazation, an unforgettable wise society who gave us the seeds and branches to create a common cultural base.
But people make Athens unically magical with they our spontaneity, with their own happiness which pervades you whenever you walk, whenever you sit at a café to drink the typical “Espresso Freddo” (cold espresso with foam). Every tourist can witness such in Plaka neighbourhood, a happy island located in the heart of Athens, where serenity and love for live take over the chaotic vibes of the centre of the city. In Plaka Athenians turn Athens at its best by chilling on the stairs drinking and chatting with friends, or even with strangers as it happened to me almost everday. In Plaka, the wonder of the place may turn your Athens experience into an unforgettable experience thanks to the athmosphere people have the power to create. As William Shakespeare once wrote: “What is the city but its people?”. If thanks to people we are all able to establish a connection between the city and its inner deep soul, the answer to the following Shakespearean quote might be “nothing!”, as the magic of the place cannot be separated from the soul of its people.

STAY. If you are a young and easy lonely traveller like me, looking for the cheapest but best location in every town, I can recommend “Pella In Hostel” , a great place where to find other backpackers and a great place where to chill from 7pm on the roofterrace which gives you a great view on the Acropolis, especially at sunset. WiFi available. No breakfast or meals. Bed available at average price of 16,- EUR/night https://www.facebook.com/Pella-Inn-145570978875281/
EATING AND DRINKING OUT. In Athens travellers find a huge and never ending varieties of restaurants and café offering typical amd exquisite Greek food. Here a selection of the best places I tried.
Melina Café, a café dedicated to Melina Mercouri, a world-famous Greek actress, active in the resistance movement against the military regime which ruled over Greece from 1967 until 1974. The café is situated on one of the many streets of Plaka Neighbourhood and offers a good selection of typical Greek food and beverages. Here I recommend the typical Espresso Freddo and a snack.

Yasemi Café Bistrot. According to my personal experience, this is the place where you can enjoy the unique life of Plaka district. While spending your time at Yasemi you can decide whether to sit at the standard tables or on a pillow on the stairs, as the tradition of Plaka wants. Yasemi offers a good selection of warm and refreshing beverages, from coffees and teas to beer and Greek wine and a good choice of snacks and easy Greek specialities to bite after a long walk around the Acropolis or just around the city. In few words, the best place to experience the true chilling Greek life. WiFi available. http://www.yiasemi.gr/

This is the next installment on my trip report from my February trip to Athens and Israel, experiencing the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens. If you are just joining, catch up on how I planned and booked the trip and prior reviews of the Emirates business class flight from Newark to Athens and the ground experience and the SAS Lounge at Newark.
The InterContinental Athenaeum Athens is located in the Neos Kosmos neighborhood of Athens, just off the Syggrou highway. The immediate area feels a bit run down and there was a variety of businesses and old buildings. My impression is that most of the guests were attending meetings and events at the hotel’s conference center.
The hotel has over 500 rooms and suites, and several restaurants and bars. There is also a pool and extensive conference facilities.
I booked the hotel for 24,000 points a night using points earned from the welcome bonus on my IHG Rewards Premier Credit Card. IHG One Rewards are a fairly easy currency to get and are a 1:1 transfer partner from Chase Ultimate Rewards.
stayed for just 3 nights, and the public rate was about 170 euros per night.
I primarily chose the hotel because it seemed well-regarded and was available on points. While it was easy to get inexpensive cabs to the center of the city, for those who want to walk or use public transportation, I would not recommend this property as a good base for touring.
The hotel website does advertise a shuttle to the city center, but it didn’t seem to be available during my stay.
The ride into Athens was pleasant and the traffic late Sunday afternoon wasn’t too bad. When we arrived at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens, there were several bellmen up front and I was quickly assisted with my luggage.
I have IHG One Rewards Diamond Status but inside, there was no clearly marked elite check-in. That said, the line was not long and I was seen quickly.
I was thanked for choosing to use my IHG One Rewards Points at the hotel and for being an elite member of IHG One Rewards. I was informed I was upgraded on account of my status. However, I was not proactively offered late check out or free breakfast, a benefit of Diamond status in the recently overhauled program.
But when I asked, I was promptly advised of the free breakfast benefit. At this property, the breakfast is a buffet in the lobby restaurant.
The lobby had an interesting sculpture and plenty of seating as well as a bar. The bar seemed to only be open at night, and I did not visit during my stay.
I booked a king classic room on points for this stay. At check-in, I was advised that I had been upgraded to a city view room, which sells for about 50 euros per night more than the classic room.
All in all, not the most exciting upgrade but not unsurprising for IHG. Despite advertising the potential for suite upgrades, IHG does not proactively upgrade Diamond elites in the way World of Hyatt does for Globalists.
After check-in formalities were complete, I was given my room key and sent on my way. I was assigned to room 514.
To get to guest room floors you need to scan your key at the elevator, something I was not advised of at check-in. I found my room quickly and a few minutes later, there was a knock at my door with my bag.
I have stayed at several InterContinental properties and the room felt like some of the others. The decor was nice and unoffensive.
True to its name, the window had an uninteresting view of the city. The blackout curtains on the window were fantastic, something I have found rare these days.
There was a nice sitting area with a couch and coffee table, as well as a proper desk area. I have found that many hotels are cutting desks out of guest rooms in recent years so I definitely did appreciate the desk.
The bathroom had a bidet and bathtub/shower.
Toiletries were in fixed big pump bottles, locker room style. As seems to be standard for InterContinental, they were by Byredo. This is one of my favorite brands, so it was great to see that.
Unfortunately, the bathtub/shower had only a half piece of glass sheet instead of a proper door, a hotel design trend I really hate. My preference is for floor-to-ceiling walls or sliding glass doors.
The bathroom had bathrobes hanging, and in a drawer in the closet just across, there were slippers, which is a nice touch.
I didn’t get pictures of the closet space at the front of the room, but there was a nice amount of storage space as well as a safe. There was also a minibar and an electric kettle with coffee, tea and mugs.
The bedding was fairly comfortable and I slept well on it. As noted the blackout curtains were fantastic and shut out all the light from entering the room.
I didn’t use the couch & sitting area much, but I did appreciate having the extra space.
Wifi was free for IHG Rewards members who booked direct, which is standard across many IHG properties. While IHG does not offer complimentary water for elites as some other programs do, I have found some InterContinental and Crowne Plaza properties offer it anyway. This was not one of those properties.
Diamond elite members get free breakfast at Cafezoe, which is on the lobby level and open from 6:30 am to 11 am daily. When I went down, I was seated pretty quickly and never found the restaurant to be too crowded. It did though take some time to be acknowledged by the wait staff and be offered coffee.
This did not end up making much difference. The coffee was pretty mediocre. There was a nice buffet on the side of the dining room as well as a made-to-order egg station.
The breakfast buffet was quite extensive, featuring waffles and French toast, several other hot items, and a rather good selection of fresh produce. There were also several cheeses and meats, and a good selection of cereal.
The end of the buffet had a bread station and a good selection of breakfast pastries.
Keeping kosher, I did not eat much but found that the produce was fine. I asked some of my fellow guests what they thought and the consensus seemed to be the food was meh, and not as good as it looked.
The hotel advertised a fitness center and spa, though I never visited them. The hotel has an outdoor pool, which was not open during my visit.
February is typically the coldest month of the year in Athens, and the pool is open seasonally from May to October. It’s located on the lobby level, just outside Cafezoe. It’s small, but it looks like it would be rather nice on a hot summer day.
Given the small size of the pool deck, I imagine it wouldn’t be easy to score a lounge chair.
All of the staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful, though service was definitely the most proactive or personalized. But I wouldn’t really expect proactive or personalized service from a massive 500+ room property operated by IHG.
As noted above, service at Cafezoe for breakfast wasn’t the fastest despite the fact the dining room wasn’t crowded, but the servers were friendly.
My main gripe is that on the first morning of my stay, I woke up to a housekeeping staff member walking into my room. They did not knock. A few days later, I was taking a quick shower before check out, and a housekeeping employee also just walked in without knocking.
Staff entering guest rooms without knocking is one of my big hotel pet peeves. It should frankly be completely unacceptable at a luxury property.
Finally, on the last day, I had a late checkout and was prepping to head to the airport. After the normal checkout time but ahead of my late checkout, it felt like they were just chasing me out. Not the way to leave a great taste in this Diamond elite’s mouth. In an effort to move on to the next leg of my trip, I opted not to pursue the matter at check out or with management.
The InterContinental Athenaeum Athens is a solid property and a comfortable place to stay in Athens. The rooms are nice. For IHG One Rewards Diamond members, the treatment is okay if not particularly polished or proactive. While the immediate area isn’t very nice, it’s very cheap and easy to get to the heart of Athens. I would definitely return at the right price, but for my next visit to Athens, I think I’d prefer a more central property.

April 22nd - 25th, 2017
The Greek Island Hamburger continued with a couple days in Athens.
I’ve been pretty excited to make it to Greece, and specifically Athens, for the mixture of classical and biblical history it boasts. Athens has only exploded in size within the last century and with the economic troubles facing Greece, it sorta curled up it’s gangly adolescent body into the fetal position and hasn’t cleaned it’s room in a while (i.e. it’s dirty). But don’t be mistaken by that description — with the right expectations this city is a satisfying destination.
So what should you expect?
Open and friendly residents. If you get out of the tourist areas, most anyone will strike up a conversation with you. We talked extensively with a hairdresser, kebab business owners, and fellow bus riders.
Lots of immigrants. Like all big cities, Athens is culturally rich with Albanians, Bangladeshis, Turks, and many other regional immigrants making there way there to find work. The recent crises has made that even more challenging, and if you take time to ask questions you can learn lots about the 100s of lives that people live — all of which you likely haven’t experienced.
Countless affordable and mouth watering eats. The upside of visiting areas struggling economically are that things are cheap (and a heavy dose of moral lamenting over white privilege). We found that the tantalizing Mediterranean dishes and tastes didn’t suffer. Typically, we cook several meals but we ditched that norm and ate out as much as possible. €2.60 for a gyros, €2 for a Freddo ( iced expresso loaded with cream — a Greek regular), €7 for an overflowing platter of kebab, chicken and pork skewers, sausage, fries and salad, enough for 4 people. These prices and food were unreal. I’m thinking heavily about our return to Athens and eating my way through every street.
When we weren’t stuffing our faces, we were matching pace with your typical Athenian vacation and trying to hit every historical site the city holds, or at least each one that was included in the €30 pass.
Our tour started with the Ancient Agora of Athens — where the likes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle discussed philosophy, prodded passersby with questions, and established a framework of thinking that has been rehearsed and revised for generations. It was also the very marketplace where Paul wandered through waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him in Acts 17. His impassioned discussion of the gospel led him up to the Areopagus, or Mars Hill, where he spoke before the Athenian council.
After the agora it was up to the Areopagus and of course the Acropolis, the mountain top holy ground of Athens, where the Parthenon and other ancient structures built to honor the gods still stand after 2400+ years. Apparently they were in tip top shape until the Venetians bombed them in the 1600s and then more recently even worse — acid rain started eating away at them.
Dancing in the rain seems less romantic.
There’s loads more of ancient things scattered throughout Athens. We visited the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Library (he was a big fan of the Greeks), Aristotle’s Lyceum, and the Roman Agora. Each sparked a deeper appreciation for the concepts and theories produced during that era and prodded us to want more of a classical education for our kids. One comment I found provoking was that the founding fathers knew far more classical history than any of our current senators and representatives — I wonder how much the slide into practical education and politicking contributes to the partisan decline of Washington.
But enough of that. After two days of intense site-seeing (and eating) it was time to set sail for island life!

The most shameless Roam-clone has thrown in the towel. While predictable, it’s sad when a project closes down. It’s not fun to do and closes beautifully imagined possibilities for the team and for the public. (As a side note, though, this update seems like they left users with only an unsupported way to download the data, which would be distinctly un-classy.)
What’s next for the Personal Knowledge Space? While Athens was never a significant part of it, this is an opportunity to reflect on where we’re at and what’s coming.
The big recent trend is the sudden addition of Artificial Intelligence all over. One day, AI generated images and text were ubiquitous. The change was hard to miss, largely due to the undercurrent of panic by people who benefit from writing online, asking “Did we… all just get commoditized?”. It went from a promised future to cheaply accessible reality seemingly overnight.
The Personal Knowledge Space has long sought the possibilities of AI. You’ve got a whole mess of personalized data in there. It should be useful for key benefits like finding connections, creating summaries, and improving writing skills. It remains to be seen, however, if this influx of AI is good for the startups. When Notion lets people write a post with a simple prompt, how do startups provide unique enough value to get new users?
A good moat is both valuable and hard to replicate. Using AI to create short summaries or improve writing skills is valuable but extremely easy to replicate. It seems unlikely a note-taking startup will be able to come up with a better writing/summary model than the rest of the market. Finding connections between writing is useful, but not that valuable to most people. Tags and search do a good enough job for most people.
Mem.ai’s take is to focus on surfacing relevant content even outside of search. They will show contextual information as you are writing — and claim it’s even good at pulling in data from outside of their app (think Google Drive, Calendar, etc). It’s as good an approach as any. I think there are ways it will be somewhat useful, if not essential. My larger concern with targeting the work use-case is the tech giants seem positioned to win. Microsoft, for example, is great at getting people inside their ecosystem and is better placed to pull up relevant data. If they ever feel they will benefit from taking away Mem.ai’s access to their documents they will do it. This is also true of Google, who have been doing an impressive job making their business offerings good. (Have you seen Google docs recently? Damn! Functionality is coming together.).
One point in Mem’s favor is their “Spotlight” feature. It opens up a Command Line Interface that can do fancy things live save the URL of your current tab, start a new note, or add a note to an existing one. I like this because it’s a step towards making non-developers feel like they have the power of developers.
While the value of the AI use cases I described seems iffy, PKM startups have a huge potential advantage in that area. It’s what kicked off Roam’s popularity. Roam took off because people wanted to share the scripts (code-based and organizational) they used with others, and were rewarded for doing so. Empowering new groups of people that way builds extreme loyalty (see Excel), and startups have a better path to doing so than the tech giants. Startups can better find the small niches of weirdos that include myself and figure out ways to empower them. The real benefit is in making a small group of users more powerful, not in making things easy for everyone.
I’m hopeful we’ll get there! There’s a ton of innovation going on in the space still. Tara’s has their own concept of empowering users through advanced configuration that seems promising and new companies keep coming.

It’s a February Sunday morning. Plenty of cold and a lovely pale sun in the sky of Athens!
We parked our car in Michael Voda street and we tried to find which way to go. “Let’s go by that side” I say to him. As we walk by, I see families running hand in hand. Looking at the Church and its main entrance, I say to him: “Here we are”.
We enter the courtyard of the parish of the Sacred Heart. We stand outside — a feeling of dread is not letting us go inside the church. While we take out our cameras and shoot pictures of the statues, of the icons, of the stained glass of the church, I notice that people haven’t stopped coming in their parish. I had never seen so many young people in a church on a Sunday morning! Young parents, young women and men, children, teenagers… Everyone was there, in a crowded church where the children sang hymns accompanied by a Catholic nun who played the guitar. The priest began the Holy Mass in Polish. After all, the majority of believers in this parish are Poles who live in this district of the capital. “The Roman Catholic Greeks who still live in this area of Athens are now few. However, the Jesuits do have a daily Mass in Greek for these Greeks”, Irene told me when we met each other a few days later. The Jesuits are a living cell in this part of Athens. Poles, Catholics, but also people who really need the Jesuits’ presence live close to this area.
But who are the Jesuits?
Irene Koutelaki, Communication Officer of the Jesuits community in Greece, would give me all the information I needed for my cover story concerning the Jesuits in Greece. Our communication started by email and later on, we had many in –person meetings. Through the ten pages of Irene’s notes, we found the information that help us explore the world of the Jesuits.
“The Jesuits are a male Catholic religious Order. What characterize each Order are its spirituality and its different field of apostolic activity. So an Order can be educational, contemplative, or action-oriented when its action has to do with active involvement in society”,  Irene would emphasize to me the meaning of the word “Presence”. So we’re talking about the presence of the Jesuit order in Greece. “In every country where the Jesuits are present, there may be one or more communities, that is, monasteries or otherwise ‘houses’ as the Jesuits call them. There are two houses in Greece: one in Athens and another one in Tinos Island. “A few years ago there was another house in Syros which stopped functioning because of the shrinking number of the Jesuits in Greece. However, the building is still used by the Jesuits when a need arises. ”
Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam
“Finding God in all things.”
This is a typical phrase used by the Order and it means that God is close to people, whatever situation they live in, as long as people have our hearts open to discern His presence. The “Apostolic Preferences”, are a selection of directions focusing on the work the Jesuits have to strive for, over a period of the ten next years. They were announced in February 2019, by Father Arturo Sosa, Father General of the Jesuits worldwide, following his election by the General Assembly in 2016, after a lengthy process of discernment of the areas where there the Jesuits are called to offer their service and to work along with society around the world.
Early March, Wednesday afternoon
We arrive at Victoria Square by the train. It is already evening and we are running to catch up with Irene who waits for us in the church. Upon our arrival, I see the lights of the church switched on and I suppose that at this hour and day, there must be a Mass in Greek. “Is anyone inside the church waiting for the service to start?” I thought. Stained-glass windows radiate, while the entire neighborhood is plunged into darkness. We ring the bell. Irene opens the door for us and takes us for a guided tour to the premises of the Jesuits that lasted more than two hours.
The calling
“Every Jesuit is a different case! In the Catholic Church, we talk about a calling, a “vocation”, as we say it. The way each religious man or woman experienced this vocation, is a very personal matter”. Becoming a Jesuit is a long journey that involves years of education / training and discernment, which are meant for the novices to understand where God calls them to offer their life and work. Part of their studies is accomplished abroad, where they work as missionaries. This way, they come into contact with other cultures; they experience the problems and needs of the world. “As regards specifically our own Greek Jesuits, the oldest comes from the islands of Tinos and Syros, where there is a strong Catholic community”.
A long time ago I had asked Irene if the Holy Masses are regular. “They are celebrated daily. On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 19.00 in Polish, on Wednesday and Friday at 19.00 in Greek. The Holy Mass, of course, is performed in both languages during weekends: on Saturday at 19.00 and on Sunday at 11.00 in Greek. On Saturday at 20.00 and on Sunday at 09.30, 12.30 and 19.00 in Polish”. After a Sunday morning Mass, in a church full of Poles, I wanted to know what keeps people so connected to the Church.
The area where this parish is located — that is, Vathi Square, Victoria Square, Larissa Station — was once one of the most prosperous districts of Athens, until the beginning of the 90’s. The gradual decline of this area led a large number of residents to move to other areas of Attica, and thus the number of Roman Catholic Greeks was dramatically reduced. The result: today’s Greek parishioners are older and very few in comparison to the past, and this is easily noticed if someone attends a Holy Mass in Greek.
In the 1980s, a large wave of immigrants from Poland came to the country in search of a better life — before the collapse of communism. Many of them settled in the area. The Jesuits had to serve the spiritual needs of Polish believers, so they celebrated Holy Masses and they administered the Sacraments in the Polish language, so that they could understand. Today, Poland’s political life has changed. Many Poles who initially settled in Athens returned home as the financial crisis in Greece affected those immigrants, depriving them the opportunity to find work. Many Polish Catholics returned home, but still, they outnumber the Greek parishioners. Those who still stay in Athens have married Greeks, or Poles, and have created a family here — so their lives are here, in Greece, and not in Poland anymore, since they have lived here more years than in their home country. Their children are Greek. They speak Greek and not so much Polish.
At the same time, in the 1990s, many Albanians with Catholic background came to Athens, or atheists who were baptized, or converted along the way and became Catholics. Those Albanians, who are parishioners of the Parish of the Sacred Heart of the Savior, attend the Holy Mass in Greek.
As we are stepping into Irene’s office, we see shelves full of magazines. All these are issues of «Ανοιχτοί Ορίζοντες» (Open Horizons) magazine, of which she is the editor. I placed my cup of coffee on her desk and started browsing them, while she suggested some issues that could have some academic interest in my field. “ ‘Open Horizons’ was founded in 1900 under the name ‘Messenger of the Sacred Heart of Jesus’ and was published as such until 1975, when it was renamed ‘Messenger — Open Horizons’. In 2007 it was merged with «Σύγχρονα Βήματα» (Contemporary Steps) journal (1970–2007), which dealt with philosophical, theological, social, and cultural topics.
Today, ‘Open Horizons’ is the historical, subscription-based, Catholic journal of the Jesuits in Greece for social and religious reflection, published by the Institute for Human Studies of the Jesuits in Greece, and, together with the newspaper “Katholiki”, are the two official news publications of the Catholic Church in Greece. The mission of the magazine is to present, analyze, and inform Catholic or non-Catholic readers about the Catholic Church and how it perceives major issues of society, faith and human life, aims to their religious education and the cultivation of faith, while at the same time it aims at strengthening fraternal dialogue with other Christian denominations and the whole society”.
“I first saw the Open Horizons magazine two years ago on Syros island”, I told Irene. “I walked out of St. George’s school an afternoon in Syros, and I saw a lot of magazines. Nobody had touched those magazines. Apparently the magazines kept being sent to one or many subscribers who were no longer there to read them…”.
“The magazine has subscribers from all over Greece and also subscribed institutions, such as charity foundations or educational organizations. Most of our subscribers are from Syros Island but we also have subscriptions from people who know and appreciate the work of the Jesuits in the field of education. The magazine’s existence, of course, is not guaranteed by subscriptions at all”, Irene told us.
People are rushing upstairs, and Irene is asking Ms. Eleni Loukou, a librarian and archivist, to open the rooms where the Archive of the Jesuit order is kept in Greece. It contains rare parchments, audiovisual material, incunabula, fermans from the Ottoman Empire and other valuable material that is waiting to be used by researchers, historians, students and other interested people. At the other side of the hall is the Library of the Jesuits in Greece which contains over 40,000 titles, and a reading room open to the public from 08.30 to 16.00 on working days. Ancient and rare books from the 15th century onwards, and books of the 18th and 19th centuries kept in the Jesuit House of Tinos were transferred to Athens, very recently. In order to display and use its contents, the Library and Archive participate in conferences, organize activities such as the “Living Libraries” a few weeks ago, and take the necessary steps to maintain and preserve the books and the Archive properly. The Library is a part of the Institute for Human Studies. The Institute is an institution founded in 2008 by the Jesuits in Athens to promote research, study and education based on scientific methodology and principles, and the Ignatian spirituality.
We close the library door, take our coffee, our notebooks for notes, and start stepping up the stairs. The lighting is not adequate; I noticed something shimmering on the stairs. I bend over to look at the small gilded descriptions that eventually write “Jesuit Refugee Service — JRS”.
Earlier I had read in the notes that:
The Jesuit Refugee Service — Greece (JRS — Greece), which is the Jesuit fathers’ service for refugees, began its operation in 2015. It is a global network of social welfare and support for refugees, migrants, victims of natural disasters and other difficult circumstances. JRS — Greece is part of JRS Europe, which is part of the global JRS International network.
Initially, Jesuit fathers offered their rooms and houses to refugees, usually families, or mothers with young children, or unaccompanied children who were drowned to see finally the mainland. In the beginning, in those rooms, they could rest for a few hours, take a bath, and be provided with food and clean clothes. Along the way, it evolved into a permanent place of residence for refugees, who have been here for more than a month, until the required documents are prepared and finally left for abroad. Here again, with the help of social workers and volunteers, refugee activities are carried out and their children are engaged in creative activities, while those who are school-age children have the necessary procedures to get enrolled in local public schools, until it’s time for them to go abroad with their family. JRS — Greece has been active since the first wave of refugees reaching Piraeus port (the biggest port of Greece) and the islands by providing clean clothing, food and essential hygiene kits to these people. Today JRS operates in Lesvos, in the camps, offering not only material assistance but also psychological, emotional and moral support. ”
We enter the refugees’ rooms. Each door belongs to a family room. I take a glance at the room with the light from where the female voices come from. Women are gathered in the kitchen while their young ones are wandering around their feet. The youngest of the group will go down the aisle to greet us with curiosity and wrap us around our feet..
“There have been very difficult cases. These women went through a lot and when they came here they had to take their lives in their hands. Many times we had to persuade them to go up to Victoria Square where the food was distributed. They were afraid to walk for a few meters. Here again they have started slowly learning about coexistence, empowerment and resolving conflicts between them. ”
“Let’s leave now because we can disturb them and interfere with their daily lives,” Irene says, whispering. We follow her while her phrase will be stuck in my head until today as I type these sentences ..
We take our things from the Irene’s office, put on our jackets and go out on the road to go to the “house” next to the Church. While entering I saw a colorful place full of paintings. A large plush giraffe warmly welcomed us.
We leave the main building. “It’s just like a house that happened to have a lot of kids.” I think. The bell rings and children of all ages pour out in the halls of the old building, with their bags and books in their hands. All ages, all nationalities, girls and boys, all religions.
Going up to the first floor, I see the kitchen. “Here Father Peter’s father volunteers to help with the children’s lunch.” Father Petros leaves the students in the classroom for a while and comes out to greet us. Having his back turned doesn’t mean he doesn’t know exactly what’s going on in the classroom. Just a little bit further I see a girl studying English by herself… “We launched this initiative in 2011. There were children on the street that did not attend or drop out of school because of indifference or difficulties such as absent parents who worked all day to support their family. These children could not live up to their childhood. It is mainly a population of immigrants who relied on their children to help them in this new country, as they did not know the language of the new country.’’ “Pedro Arrupe Youth Center” has become a place for study, personal development and educational empowerment. The purpose of the Center is also to widen the horizons of children and young people in three key areas, ‘Know-Open up-Believe’. They seek to get to know themselves through creative activities such as music, theater, crafts, and foreign languages ​​and to develop interpersonal relationships as they find themselves in an environment which is a meeting point for children from different backgrounds.
The aim is to help each child and to shape them as much as possible in a structured and enjoyable environment, given that in addition to the financial and survival problems that these children and their families face, they also have to deal with phenomena of domestic violence, against which the Center’s Director, Mrs Argiro Hadjiantoniou, has taken drastic measures. Today, Pedro Arrupe Youth Center has over 150 children, many of whom, in addition to their supportive teaching and pedagogical programs (based on the Jesuit education), are offered daily hot meals and food for their families.
“Parents sometimes work with us and sometimes they don’t. We explain to them that the Center is not a place where they can “park” their child; we want them to be actively involved. In many cases, children do not listen to their parents and we are the last stronghold”.
There is a room a little different from the others … The room of fantasy, the room of the magical world.
I walk in this room, Father Petros turns off the lights and explains to me how the magic room works. “During an internal assessment, we found that our children suffer from lack of imagination. So this room was transformed into a fantasy room. Here, with the educator who has taken over, the Center’s kids wear a hat and start telling a story the rest of the kids”.
Each day, the Center welcomes children of all ages from countries: Nigeria, Congo, Angola, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Bangladesh. “Here we work with children until 19:30 and then they can return home.” “The Center works with volunteers, mainly Greeks but also from other countries — Italy, Portugal, Spain etc. They are not necessarily members of the Catholic Church and their contribution is invaluable”. “We are often confronted with domestic violence and we have to identify it and then deal with it”. As we begin to descend to the ground floor again and greet them goodbye, Father Peter explains to me: “We didn’t include lunch time when the Center started operating. As the time passed, we noticed that children could not concentrate on their lessons. The reason was that they were just extremely hungry”. Before saying goodbye, Father Petros can’t hide his joy: “Some of our kids passed the FCE exam in English. It is an accomplishment. I wish they could all pass the exams”. Saying goodbye to them was not so easy… They gave me printed material: “Open Horizons” magazine, the “Pedro Arrupe Youth Center” newspaper, photos, the Jesuit Refugee Service leaflet. As we leave, we see the Superior of the Jesuits in Greece who is leaving to watch a performance along with two volunteers of JRS — Ellada. We bid farewell to Irene outside her office and we are about to leave. Maybe I don’t remember well… the church lights were turned off and the stained-glass windows were not lit. We get into the subway and I hold tight my bag with my notes and my camera.
July — August 2019 It took me a long time to write this article — cover story. I would like to put my thoughts and my feelings in order. What I remember is that in a degraded neighborhood of Athens where most of us have never been, miracles happen every day. I will keep in my heart the words of Father Peter and Irene. Words that reminded me it is best not to use other people’s sufferings for marketing and sponsorship purposes, of for shooting photos. Not to sacrifice the uniqueness of others and the uniqueness of their life … Because God is everywhere around us … and certainly God exists in those few square meters of Michael Voda street. I would like to thank Irene Koutelaki for her valuable help, for answering to all my questions and for gathering useful information for me. Most of the cover story information is based on her own text. If you would like to know more about what was mentioned in the text, you can find it in the following links:

I am an African American woman living in Athens, Greece. I’m used to going to the grocery store and seeing people that look like me. I am accustomed to attending events or bars and seeing other black people dancing and having fun. I grew up in a black Methodist church where the people were my extended family, my community. I would go to my mother's on Sunday evenings and have dinner with her and my grandmother, surrounded by my beautifully black matriarch.
I walk the Athenian streets in my new town feeling like I am the only black person people have ever seen. Anywhere I go, I’m stared at as if there is a giant clown nose attached to my face. In my everyday life, I am 99% of the time the only black person in the room, building, train, or party. It used to REALLY bother me to feel so isolated while pursuing my professional career, but now I choose not to give it much attention. However, sometimes the waves of missing the black community crash upon my heart.
On one particular day, while I was out shopping, I was called a N***** by some boys at the mall. I felt angry that this racism followed me here from the States. I left the mall and continued shopping, aggravated, arguing about what I…

This charming mountain village boasts stunning scenery, authentic local culture, and a unique atmosphere that sets it apart from the crowds.
When you arrive, you’ll be greeted by crisp mountain air and the picturesque sight of quaint stone houses adorned with vibrant blooms lining the winding streets. Unlike souvenir shops peddling mass-produced goods, Arachova’s stores brim with unique locally crafted treasures. Engaging with friendly vendors becomes an opportunity to discover hidden gems and learn about the local artisanship.
Instead of following a rigid itinerary, allow yourself to get lost in the charming maze of streets. Each twist and turn reveals hidden delights — a cafe serving melt-in-your-mouth baklava, a sun-drenched square buzzing with lively conversation, or an ancient church whispering tales of its storied past. Time seems to slow down here, inviting you to savor each moment like a sip of the local honey wine, rich and smooth with the essence of the mountains.

I’m perched on a rocky outcrop below the Acropolis, the Parthenon’s columns catching the last golden light of the day. Down in Plaka, motorbikes zip past tavernas where locals clink glasses of ouzo. My sneakers are caked with dust from the climb, and I’m nursing a €2 Greek coffee from a street vendor, feeling like I’ve landed in a city that’s half myth, half street party. Athens, the beating heart of Greece, is home to 3.1 million people and over 2,500 years of stories. It’s a place where ancient ruins rub shoulders with graffiti-covered bars, and siesta naps give way to late-night souvlaki runs.

Ancient Athens was a center for the arts, learning, and philosophy, the home of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum, Athens was also the Birthplace of Socrates, Plato, Pericles, Aristophanes, Sophocles, and many other well-known philosophers, writers, and politicians of ancient Greece. It is widely referred to as the Cradle of Democracy, and Western Civilization mainly due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC on the then-European Continent.
Pericles (495–429 BCE), came from an illustrious aristocratic family and was an Athenian statesman, general, orator, and arts patron. He was Pivotal in the development of Athenian democracy and the Athenian empire.
He helped establish democracy in Athens and is considered the first citizen of a democratic Athens. He transformed its alliances into an empire. Rebuild the Acropolis after it was destroyed by the Persian invasion. And many more.
He believed in the wisdom of the goddess Athena, the guiding spirit of Athens. And lived by his rational ideologies

Athens, the historical and cultural capital of Greece, is a city steeped in history located on the shores of the Aegean Sea. Known as the birthplace of ancient Greek civilization, this city exudes an atmosphere filled with history at every corner. On my recent trip, I embarked on a journey to explore Athens, and I couldn’t help but be enchanted by this unique experience.
Journey to the Acropolis:
Upon arriving in Athens, my first stop was, of course, the Acropolis. This ancient citadel, a symbol of Greece, is perched atop a high hill and greets visitors with the splendor of the Parthenon Temple. As I ascended to the Acropolis, walking among the historical ruins, I felt the excitement of traversing through time. Rediscovering the captivating beauty of the ancient era against the backdrop of the city’s panoramic views filled me with profound admiration.
Plaka District:
Descending from the Acropolis, I visited the heart of the city, known as the Plaka District. With its narrow cobblestone streets, colorful shops, and traditional taverns, Plaka is one of the liveliest and most charming neighborhoods in Athens. Here, while savoring local delicacies, I found myself immersed in a unique blend of ancient and modern atmospheres.
Ancient Agora and Old Town:
To delve deeper into Athens’ historical fabric, I made my way to the Ancient Agora. This was the place where philosophers like Socrates and Plato once walked. Roaming among the ruins of the Agora felt like embarking on a journey through the past. Afterwards, getting lost in the narrow streets of the Old Town and wandering among the traditional houses made me feel as if time stood still.
Modern Athens:
Athens not only boasts the legacy of ancient times but also thrives as a modern city. Central points like Monastiraki Square and Syntagma Square are lined with modern cafes, restaurants, and shopping centers. Exploring these areas allowed me to discover the modern and dynamic side of the city.
As I strolled through the streets of Athens, I savored the experience of exploring a city intertwined with history. Following the footsteps of ancient Greek civilization while experiencing the vibrant atmosphere of a modern capital was an unforgettable experience. Athens was not just a trip for me; it was a journey through time. A bridge between the past and the future was built before my eyes, and this experience will forever leave a lasting impression on me.

What makes a civilization great? A civilization achieves greatness when various facets of humanity — physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual — are allowed to blossom and find full expression.
When you look at the ruins of Athens, you see evidence of this greatness.
Many impressive cities in history have made great contributions to the growth of human civilization, but few have come close to what Athens came to achieve and represent. When I visited the city I found the testament of its greatness written in stones; in its broken columns and fallen walls.
As you reach Athens, you see its skyline dominated by a cluster of massive structures on a hilltop. These were magnificent temples, now only ruins, which towered over the city in its glorious days.
The most impressive among the structures is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Goddess Athena. Its imposing columns striving to kiss the sky stir within one the ever-present yearning to transcend our earthly limits and reach for something beyond.
For a moment transport yourself to ancient Athens and observe the Athenians doing their everyday, mundane chores; haggling over the price of wheat in the market, herding their sheep to olive gardens, plotting a…

What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.
— Attributed to Pericles, 5th Century BCE
Ancient Athens is often referred to as the birthplace of Western thought. Whilst we have a lot to thank the Athenians for in terms of the invention of education as we know it, critical thinking, science, democracy, technology and architecture, everyday life looked a lot different back then. There were vast inequalities depending on gender, political and economic standing, for one only free men were classed as citizens, with females and slaves living a much more restrictive life.
In this article, we’ll delve into what life would have looked like as an inhabitant of Athens, in terms of their occupation; diet; how they socialised; where they lived and what family life looked like.
Athens, as a thriving and bustling coastal city boasted a vast array of different occupations of all skill sets and familial backgrounds. From high ranking jobs in the military, philosophical tutors, local government officials to the less well paying jobs such as fishing, farming and everything in between. Many made their living through the marketplace- the…

Matt D. Smith is the owner and Design Director at Studio Mds, a small independent design studio in Athens, GA. He created the Float Label Pattern for digital form input fields, which is now a design standard in Google’s Material Design Guidelines. He’s a proud father of four and has led creative work for agencies and brands in the US and Singapore including NBC, AT&T, Sprint, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Dwell, Razorfish, Sapient and more.
When your friends or parents ask to you what job do you do, how do you answer?
I tell them I’m a designer and work mostly on websites and mobile apps. Everyone knows what those things are so this answer proves most digestible for a layman.
What is your background, how did you train?
I was always drawing when I was a kid. In college I gravitated towards drawing and painting and eventually made my way into the Graphic Design department at the University of Georgia. There I learned a lot of the fundamentals of design–typography, white space, color, contrast, etc. After graduating I got heavily involved in the Flash community and taught myself Actionscript 2.0. This sparked my passion for digital design.
What the web can do to make this world a better place? How did the web improve your life( if it did)?
The web can’t do anything on its own–it needs people. It’s a powerful tool to connect humans all over the world around a specific thing. The possibilities are endless.
Can you show us three examples of interface that in your opinion improved human life?
“Improving human life” is definitely subjective depending on whom you ask. I’d say a few that make my life easier are iMessage, Fantastical, and Dropbox. iMessage for short specific bursts of communication. Fantastical for its natural language input to create events. And finally, Dropbox that reliably keeps all of my digital stuff wherever I go.
On quora.com, time ago there was a long discussion in answer to the question “what is the most intuitive interface ever created?”; according to Felipe Rocha it is the nipple, in your opinion instead? (http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-intuitive-interfaces-ever-created)
Hmm, maybe fruit. It appeals to most of your senses–sight, smell, feel, taste. It serves a core human need, hunger. It’s also nutritious. =)
How is your work day type?
I get into work around 8 AM and try to write first thing in the morning before email, jumping into design, or anything else. From then on until around 5pm, it’s design, emails, etc. all day.
What is the most stimulating and challenging project you have accomplished?
The most challenging project I’ve worked on so far has been Shiplify, a commercial transportation management system. There are huge amounts of information along with the constraint of a mobile device that really leveled up my thinking and skills.
What is, among the existing digital services, the one you wanted to do?
Hah, I’m still trying to figure that out.
Many designers commit the mistake of starting a project directly from Photoshop, is there a perfect design method? What is your approach to the creative process?
Starting in Photoshop is a good way to create art, but not solve a problem. The more experience I gain as a designer, the more time I wait before jumping into a design. I start with lots and lots of questions about the problem we’re trying to solve and why.
The “design” is an important part of our analogic life. What is the role of the designer in our digital life?
The core role of the designer hasn’t changed much from analog to digital. It remains to communicate visually. The trick is to find out what you’re trying to communicate and why.
Do you believe it is important for a designer to have a deep knowledge of matters as User Experience, Interaction Design, Product Design, and Front-end development?
It depends on what the designer wants to do with her personal career, but I if she wants to be the best she can possibly be, she’ll need to have a relentless pursuit of knowledge of her craft. Learning to code, etc. will only help her connect dots easier and gain a better understanding of digital products overall.
In which way do you make a difference between User Interface and user experience?
The UX is the design in its entirety– the alpha and the omega. From the words on the very first entry screen, to a payment receipt sent via email, UX covers it all. It is holistic, from business strategy to behavioral design. The UI is a smaller portion of the broader picture that deals specifically with the parts people touch and click. The two are deeply intertwined and should be considered in parallel. Sometimes UX decisions can be enhanced by UI design and vice versa. The best UI designers will also be great UX designers. I’m not a big fan of segmenting the titles of UX and UI designer, which is why I call myself simply a designer. I do both.
What is your relationship with the developers? There are people that have a relationship of continuous confrontation and other of deep friendship, where do you collocate with respect to this question?
If you want to work well with others, there needs to be friendship and common ground. If you find yourself constantly at odds with developers or anyone else for that matter, you’re doing it wrong. There’s a degree of humility that needs to be present for people to work together harmoniously.
How do you think that your career and job will evolve in the next 5 years?
I’ll always design things. It’s my thing, ya know? With that said, I do see myself transitioning to more strategy, planning, and writing to build my own products as opposed to only doing client work.
A famous quotation of David Carson (noted American graphic designer) says: “Graphic design will save the world right after rock and roll does”.Will the User Interface Design save the world, before, at the same time, or after the graphic design?
After. UI is no savior.
What do you think about Dribbble? Is it a good way to get a job? What’s the best way to find a job as designer?
Dribbble is amazing. I’ve met great people there and it’s delivered lots of job opportunities. People often mention Dribbble as a place where people focus on shallow design and getting likes, but that’s not Dribbble’s fault, that’s people’s fault. Look at Facebook, it’s an amazing communication tool, but it becomes mind-numbing after too much exposure–not because of the software, because of the content.
Dribbble is what you make it.
What book would you advice to a Junior Designer?
Hmm, that’s tough. There are so many great books; my suggestion would be to read constantly. There isn’t a magic bullet. You have to progress gradually. One book that I’m really enjoying at the moment is Peter Thiel’s, “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future”
Always as far as advices: what tools for the design?
Beyond wireframes, I’ve become a big Sketch fanatic for UI design. I still use Photoshop regularly for different things, but Sketch is now my goto for layout out UI for a website or an app.
What tools for the projects management?
For wireframing, I swear by Adobe Illustrator. I’ve tried out most software for this purpose and Illustrator is by far the fastest and most versatile vector editor there is. In fact, I’ve created a whole blog series devoted to rapid UX design with Adobe Illustrator, which can be found at http://aiux.co

In 1867 Matthew Arnold wrote a book titled Culture and Anarchy in which he held up two saving springs of our civilization: Athens — from which we get the inner urge to “see things as they really are” — and Jerusalem, from which we get the directive “to set doing above knowing.”
I don’t know if I would draw the contrast between these two civilizational sources in the terms that Arnold used. But I do know that, in studying, teaching and loving philosophy as I do, while at the same time feeling myself to be Jewish at my self’s core, I must in some sense resemble the human type that Arnold was talking about.
On my last day of teaching at Brooklyn College, I passed around the attendance sheet for the Intro course and later found that the students had penned their own farewells. Since those attendance sheets now hang in my study, I can quote a line or two: “I am sure that, speaking for everybody, you touched many minds and lives. Thank you for portraying philosophy in such a user-friendly way …” or again, “Just know that you made a difference in many peoples’ lives, especially mine.”
It’s in the light of recent developments on university campuses that I’ve cast this backward glance over the terrain of my working life. What did it feel like to me, to work in the precincts of the academy — the House that Plato Built? What did it mean to me, teaching philosophy to students at Brooklyn College — that is, to young people from all over the world? My graduate school teacher of philosophy, the Straussian Stanley Rosen, described it as the disclosure of “beautiful and sacred things.” I remember Leo Bronstein — who was a celebrated teacher of art history at Brandeis — marveling, in his Russian/Catalan accents, that “the kids are forced, fo-r-r-rced (!) to learn sublime matters!”
In my turn, I viewed teaching philosophy as the transmission of a civilizational power and presence. If it was an Intro course, I would make the case for the importance to each of them of this transmission. “This will help you to decode the life you will face. It’s not true that you are what you eat. You are what you think! When you notice the way people behave, the way they frame their challenges, and the reasons or rationales they reference in explaining their decisions — you will be better able to lift out the thinking that lies back of all that.”
Sometimes I referred to the saying of Socrates that the unexamined [i.e. philosophically unsituated] life is not worth living. He meant, you’re not making the best use you can of your time here if you can’t identify and make good use of its philosophic assumptions. It’s not about choosing the “best philosophy” to live and steer by. They all have limitations or shortcomings, as does any attempt to understand a topic. No topic can be plumbed to every depth conceivable. But to know how to get to the available depths and to plumb that is a great power — empowering in the best sense — provided that (as with any power) it’s not used for harm.
So much for recalling what it was like for me to teach philosophy to real students. That said, we can fast forward to the present. What is it like to perceive young people who wear the name of “student” but mask their faces, menacing fellow students and teachers, injuring the working people who keep their academic classrooms and buildings functional? To what can I compare the predicament of a real teacher facing such defilements? Perhaps to the situation of a farmer whose field has been sown with salt and rendered barren by those means?
And what would I say to the so-called students who seem to relish doing precisely that kind of harm? If you attack the precincts of learning and teaching, you desecrate your own ability to learn or later to teach what you learned. You will still be able to be indoctrinated, and to indoctrinate others, but you can’t learn and you can no longer teach what you learned. And it’s not merely self-harm that you inflict. You injure your city, your country, your civilization. The wound you inflict has concentric circles of wounds that lie all round it.
And as for me, I wouldn’t know how to cure such wounds. Whatever healing modalities I possess — they don’t stretch that far.
At present, I have yet to reroute my life so that the powers I’ve acquired have some further riverbed channel down which to flow. I can’t just stand at the river’s edge and forever shed tears for what’s been lost.

Hypatia and her revival in Raphael’s School of Athens.,https://medium.com/@sbashllari/hypatia-and-her-revival-in-raphaelos-school-of-athens-7863799c7c80,"Sign up

The renowned masterpiece “The School of Athens” by Raphael captivates viewers with its iconic central portrayal of Aristotle and Plato, gesturing downwards and upwards, respectively. The canvas is a tapestry of intellectual luminaries, featuring figures like Heraclitus in a crouched pose beside a sturdy marble cube, and the revered Socrates and Pythagoras. The room is further enriched by the commanding presence of two statues in the corners — Apollo, the god of light and music, gracefully holding a lyre, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom (or her Roman counterpart, Minerva). Intricately weaving together the threads of knowledge, Raphael’s brushstrokes breathe life into the embodiment of wisdom.
As aptly articulated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Raphael paints wisdom.”
However, there is a lesser known ( and more disputed — arguably the most interesting) figure, dressed all in white, almost set apart from the rest of the painting and looking straight at us, as if Raphael was inviting the viewer to look more closely at this figure in his crowd of mental giants. This figure is often noted as Francesco Maria della Rovere, duke of Urbino (1490–1538). However important being a condottiero might have been, it seems that this particular persona would be a misfit in the room of eternal wisdom. Others argue that the feminine presence of this figure is indisputable, and that figure is in fact Hypatia of Alexandria, a Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, long forgotten and being revived by Raphael.
Hypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator, and best known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy’s Almagest (treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths). As noted, her philosophy was Neoplatonist and was thus seen as “pagan” at a time of bitter religious conflict between Christians (both orthodox and “heretical”), Jews, and pagans. Following the accession of Cyril to the bishopric of Alexandria, Hypatia’s fate suffered a brutal death.
“They dragged her into a building known as the Kaisarion, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using ostraka, which can either be translated as “roof tiles” or “oyster shells”. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire Unfortunately, all Hypatia’s work is lost except for its titles and some references to it by some of her students, reconstructing thus her contribution.”¹
However, back to Raphael’s painting — how can we know that is truly a woman being depicted there when the very figure of Hypatia was emblematic of heresy in the circle of the church ?
“At the same period, there was a common practice artists used, Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo each sketched full-sized cartoons of their large murals on the paper and pricked tiny holes along the contours. They then would blow charcoal through tiny holes onto the walls beneath. Each charcoal “sketch” blown onto the wall would lay the figured groundwork for the intricate painting that followed. When the mural was complete, the cartoons themselves would often be destroyed.”²
However, luckily, Raphael’s complete cartoon for School of Athens has survived and is considered “the most remarkable object of its kind surviving from the Renaissance”. In the cartoon, in a roomful of men, there is only one figure wearing a veil, a classic and common article of clothing used in depicting women in Renaissance paintings. The same veil is not present in the final painting — given that most final works needed somehow the approval of the ruling caste.
In fact, The School of Athens is part of a much larger masterwork, representing only one wall of the most brilliantly illustrated room in history — the Stanza della Segnatura, one of “Raphael’s Rooms” in the Papal Palace of the Vatican. For the first two centuries after it was created, this stanza, a private library to the popes and was only seen by the eyes of the few elite elders in the heart of the Vatican Church.

It takes place in silence, mainly as the people who are supposed to safeguard it remain too preoccupied to see what’s going on.
And that is the bitter lesson of Ancient Athens. Now America is suffering from the same blind spots.
It’s history repeating itself and rhyming with a harsh cadence.
Here’s why two democracies, old and new, might be more alike than we realize.
Athens made something radical: a body of language nobody on this planet had ever seen or heard.. government of the people, by the people.
Voting assemblies. Citizen juries. Laws that treated everybody the same, that is, at least if you were male and free.
By today’s standards it was not fair but it was a beginning.
Like America’s beginning wasn’t perfect — but it was constructed to get better.
Both systems were built on faith as much as bricks.. after people stopped caring, everything wobbled.
Lowerclass Athenians were given a voice by Pericles, who paid them to serve. That widened access.
But what it opened is the door to louder voices, not smarter ones.
As the conversation of leaders descended the crowd was humored.
Applause lines started wars. Justice was about winning a popularity contest.
It was all spectacle. And spectacle requires a villain.
America’s founders were obsessed with history.
They saw what had gone wrong in Athens and tried to slow things down through checks, balances and staggered elections.
The system functioned when people believed in it.
And now the crack is beginning to show in the walls.. Rules that are not violated but rejected.
There’s a rhythm to the drift of democracies. The lyrics are different, but the chorus strikes the same chords.
Athenian Breakdown
American Parallel
These are not symptoms in isolation. They’re a trendline.
Although this time around Athens surrendered to oligarchs after losing a war.
The Thirty Tyrants ruled brutal and short-lived, but that’s all.
The people fought back. Democracy returned.
But it limped.. not marched. What came back wasn’t what it was.
Athens was then given a second chance. It simply wasn’t strong enough for them.
There aren’t any mobs storming the assembly with swords.
No decrees, no coups..just slowbmotion neglect.
Democracy crumbles not when buildings fall in one big blow but when cracks are left unfixed.
And the tools to repair it aren’t glamorous. They’re tedious. Uncelebrated. Necessary.
Athens didn’t fail because it was flawed.
It dropped because too many trusted that it wouldn’t.
America has its warnings. They’re loud.
The resolution depends on whether we are listening to them or are the ones scrolling past.

Review of The Dave Red Athens — April 2025
Check-in was smooth, especially considering my name has a special character and often gets misspelled —I checked in online - No hassle this time, Plus points — which was a nice start. The hotel was clean and looked freshly presented, but there are some serious downsides you should know about before booking. Totally outside the control of the Dave hotel !
There is a hidden door in the ground floor library, You open it to a store room and a stain well come oncome on -dave red guys- like it a Bar.
The hotel is only a few hundred metres from Omonoia Metro Station, but walking those few hundred metres feels like crossing a dystopian wasteland. Junkies and people clearly struggling with addiction are everywhere — shooting up in doorways, passed out on the pavement, or stumbling around in a daze. One man ahead of me was swinging a syringe around like it was a cigarette, in broad daylight. I didn’t feel directly threatened, but the general atmosphere was intense and unpleasant.
You also see severely unwell women loitering — prostitutes— in what looks like a desperate state. Some stood motionless at corners like statues, others circled the same block over and over. It was deeply sad. The whole area feels forgotten and unsafe. If you’re not used to this kind of street scene, it’s genuinely shocking.
The room was fine in terms of cleanliness, but definitely unfinished. It had a clean, modern look — no carpets, just polished flooring — but the detailing wasn’t great. The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain.
The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain. I’ve worked in construction and can say with confidence — the floor of the shower area has no angle, no lip, and no waterproof tilting detail. It’s just a flat surface, of latex paint so the water spreads quickly across the bathroom floor. After five minutes of showering, you’ll find yourself standing in a puddle with water edging toward the bedroom. A proper fix would involve cutting a groove or sloping the floor slightly toward the drain — basic stuff that just wasn’t done.
Breakfast at The Dave red left a lot to be desired. Compared to nearby options — for example, The Stanley Hotel just around the corner — it was dismal. The Stanley offers a proper buffet with a rotating toaster, beautiful sour cherry syrup,for your Greek yoghurt, fried bacon, tiny sausages, scrambled eggs, and a few other hot items. The Dave, by contrast, felt like a bit of a cost-cutter.
They had boiled eggs, but no scrambled eggs — maybe because that would’ve required just a bit more effort. Overall, it gave the impression of trying to appear trendy while quietly cutting corners. if it cn be wheeled out of a room that what we got
The breakfast room is nicely styled, but it’s let down by the details. The felt on the pool table is shredded, the plumbing is noisy and should of only int the breakfast room be covered up (you can hear when someone above flushes), and coffee is served in paper cups — . On my first morning, I managed to get a proper mug, but by the second, it was back to takeaway cups. For a breakfast I had to pay extra for, it felt more like a quick hostel setup than a hotel experience.
The Dave red clearly leans into quirky style — and to be fair, it succeeds in that. The building used to be the Communist Party headquarters of Greece, and I really think they should lean into that history more. There’s a massive mural in the breakfast room, but no real explanation or story told about the building’s past. That would’ve been a cool addition — Athens has history at every corner, and this building has a unique one.
The Dave is trying to be hip and alternative — and inside, it mostly succeeds. But the location is grim and the construction quality isn’t there yet. If you’re familiar with Athens and know what to expect, you might manage. But for most travellers, especially first-timers, I’d strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Safer, better alternatives: try Psiri, Koukaki, or Plaka — all still central, with far more charm and far fewer needles.
Bottom line: cool hotel, bad street, broken shower. staying in the Plaka next time.

On the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, in Southeast Europe, is the nation of Greece. It is renowned for its illustrious past, vibrant present, and iconic locations including the Acropolis in Athens, the Palace of Knossos in Crete, and the historic settlement of Delphi. Greece is renowned for its mouthwatering cuisine, which includes meals like moussaka and souvlaki, as well as its stunning islands, like Santorini and Mykonos. Greece has Greek as its official language, and it is a parliamentary republic, and the currency used is the Euro.
In the Attica region of Greece, Athens, the country’s capital and largest city, is home to more than 3 million people. With a history that dates back more than 3,000 years, Athens is one of the oldest towns in all of Europe.
The Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Ancient Agora are just a few of the famous sites that can be seen there. It is noted for its rich cultural heritage. Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates are just a few of the philosophers and well-known thinkers from antiquity who were born and raised in Athens.
Numerous institutions, including the National Archaeological Museum and Acropolis Museum, are also located in the city. Athens is a contemporary city with a thriving arts and entertainment…

Fofi: I have been heavily involved in the music industry for the past 25+ years as a DJ, radio producer, consultant and music journalist in various media outlets, specializing in electronic music. I started DJing professionally when I was 16, so I experienced the difficulties that a girl had first hand, trying to make it in a (local) man-dominated industry, needless to say female DJs were a scarcity at the time — it was so difficult to find a role model to be inspired by, look up to, reassure in some way that there was a future, a possibility for a career out there for me. I had to work extremely hard, rely only on myself, constantly prove that I deserve to be there, belong there over and over (and maybe still do today), until I finally got to a point of being able to exclusively live by my profession.
Greece is quite behind in matters of equality, so at some point I decided that I had to give back, I did not want other people and especially girls having to go through what I went through to get somewhere. So, I created HER project. It was a very lonely ride at first, but luckily I met Virginia at a HER party. I detected her drive, our common values and ethos, which led me to decide to invite her on board. With HER project and our trajectory in music as starting points, we were more than excited to launch the Athenian chapter of shesaid.so in April 2020, elevating our initiatives and efforts on a wider and larger scale, belonging to a like-minded larger and international community.
Virginia: I started DJing and producing quite recently, my journey began in 2018 though I did listen to electronic music before that. One night I met Fofi at a HER party, where we discussed about the concept of HER as a female empowerment initiative in music. I immediately resonated with it, because I had experienced gender biased inequality and sexism from one of my mentors. HER felt like a safe outlet to me, and the fact that I am able to utilize my art to offer a safer space to minorities and do something good for our society is the utmost purpose. From then on I joined HER and along with Fofi we are trying to involve more and more women into it, and raise awareness locally. Until now there isn’t a similar initiative as HER in Greece, neither in electronic music nor in other genres. This is why we also initiated shesaid.so Athens, to reach out to the music industry cluster in general, including other genres and professionals beyond artists only.
We regularly collaborate with Athens Pride, both as representatives of gender minorities, but also as members of the LGBTQI+ community. We are always on the lookout for new, inclusive collaborations. World Pride House in Malmo had an open call for proposals, and we decided to sent in a triptych, which included a livestreamed HER DJ set along with drag performances, a live HER DJ set with VRGN, and a very interesting panel discussion on gender equality in the music industry. We were extremely happy that all of them passed. At the discussion, we are hosting 3 brilliant speakers, event planner and curator, Mirca Lotz, from Germany, psychologist and gender equality advisor, Maria Rodriguez, from Spain and Dina Liberg of shesaid.so Sweden, all of whom gave us their own valuable perspectives on current issues and future actions we could all take.
The Greek scene is buzzing — Athens is becoming a very interesting and intriguing art hub, which has been characterized as the “new Berlin”. However, the music ecosystem, as a whole, is light years away from the Berlin scene. Starting from the lack of basic state support and funds, legislations, unions, statistics, lack of professions such as artist managers, music marketers and communicators, label management, agencies, and more. Needless to say, the music industry is still not as equal and inclusive as it should be with minorities. It was only recently that the issue was even a matter of discussion — shesaid.so Athens organized the FIRST panel that addressed the subject in September 2020.
Representation of women is still not enough and the arguments range from “there aren’t enough women musicians to begin with”, “there is no equality problem, women are the ones who do not want a career in music”, to “currently the top DJs are women, so there is no need for gender equality initiatives” and more.
Greece lacks basic education on what gender stereotypes are, on what ways gender inequality appears, what actions, comments and behaviors spark inequality. It is really funny, until it was not anymore, there are many times that as HER project we have felt that we have to actually convince people here that there is a problem with equality in music.
At the same time, Greece is experiencing a huge societal crisis with a constant and very alarming rise in femicides and gender violence, especially during the pandemic, while the patriarchal system is still strong in our society. Therefore, gender initiatives are needed more than ever, and that does not apply only to music.
On a positive note, more and more people speak up, more women and minorities express their own experiences and there is less fear in sharing one’s own story. In In that sense and in order to shed light on the matter of equality in music, in early 2021 we started a video series called #HERwords, where we invite women DJs and producers to answer a few questions in a 5’ video, sharing their own experiences and advice.
Last but not least, in 2021 the #MeToo movement also made its “debut” in the country — it created a sense of shock in the general public, but at the same time it gave a tremendous feeling of strength, support and hope not only to the victims, who boldly went public with their stories, but also to women and gender minorities in general.
What we have noticed from our collaborations with international artists and professionals, as well as members of the shesaid.so community, is that even though the needs are the same, each country and region has a very different perspective in terms of equality in the music industry, and consequently the respective actions each one takes lead to different sets of milestones we need to reach, so as to achieve working in a safer scene.
Everything begins and ends with education in our opinion. Firstly, we need research and statistics — numbers to show what is really happening in each area and profession, to understand each society and then to set up a localized approach and a clear strategy based on local needs and current social situations.
Raising awareness is also a great starting point, by simply advocating for gender equality and sharing experiences. Digital outlets, like social media, have much power that we can all exploit in that sense. Storytelling has become so much easier now, and if one’s story can affect and change just one more person, then it can create a snowball effect. E.g. Rebekah’s #ForTheMusic campaign sparked discussions and gained followers ranging from artists, to promoters, to clubbers and more. This demonstrated a suppressed need, which surfaced and engaged several professionals in the industry, even though it was a bit strange that it took so long for it to happen — since it was a subject we were all discussing constantly behind the scenes -, but thank the Universe it finally did.
Taking this as a starting point and using the Morillo extremely sad incident as an example, we have to really think why it took so long for mouths to open, even though it was made clear that people knew, why we saw so many people standing by him and not the victims, in the first place, but also after his death. This has to change. We need to start talking more and on a wide scale about safe dancefloors and booths, we need more men allies. We know the problem, we need viable solutions.
Finally, actively supporting communities is also an action we can all take in our daily lives. It is not enough to remain impartial anymore. In order to improve the music industry we need to radically change our daily habits, behaviors, collaborations — we need to actively include minorities in shows, we need to actively protect them and support them, until there is no need to do so anymore.
Fofi: I am an introvert, but very skilled at socializing. Music has always been the means to express my feelings through sound, vibrations and words. I have been doing this since I can remember myself, so it was extremely difficult for me to accept that new “normality”. I hold the longest-living residency at a club in the country, being the resident of Sodade2 for the past 21 years, so I did not only lose my outlet for communication, but also my coexistence with my friends and chosen family. I cannot pick one set as my favourite, I am blessed to have had so many. My latest favourite ones are the b2b sets by me and Virginia at Sodade, when after 4 am we usually set the club on fire, but also our performance as HER project at the first Sonar Athens.
Virginia: What I love about performing live is this non-verbal vibe exchange with the crowd, a give and take, while they are trusting us and letting loose to our music. We have had some of our best nights at a local club where Fofi resides, called Sodade, where we play for hours and experiment with house, electro and techno tracks, mixing genres and classic tracks, too. Also, our set at Sonar Athens is one that I will never forget! The stage, the people, the music, the honor of being part of Sonar, it was truly a night I will never forget.
Virginia: I simply won’t do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable, disrespected, insulted, dehumanized. There is an inner voice, I believe we all have, that reminds us of who we are and warns us when we are about to compromise that. I lately listen to this voice more and more, and it tells me that I am enough for those who respect and enjoy what I have to give, and I would never compromise my values and dignity for anything further.
Fofi: Music is my life, so the way I approach music and my career is actually the way I carry myself in this world: with the utmost care and respect.
The fact that we belong to this amazing global network that consists of exceptional people changing the game in the music industry, coexisting with extraordinary, talented, vigorous, dynamic and driven people, sharing the same mindset and ethos is actually a pure privilege and gift. shesaid.so is shaping the future that transcends the music industry and we want to help in that with all our being.
Virginia: I would pick “Rub” by Peaches. Peaches has been one of my favorite artists since I was young. As a woman, listening to an artist like Peaches, her strength, her expression, her I-dont-give-a-f*ckness, has been truly inspirational. Rub specifically, was published in 2015. It has brilliant lyrics, which are an ode to what is (still) happening today. I would absolutely love to have contributed with techno versions, distortions and beats.
Fofi: “Lifeforms” by Future Sound Of London. I consider it a pure piece of art, a pivotal moment in the electronic music history that shaped the things to come. I think that listening to it, when it was released, I could actually feel my brain being reprogrammed to another dimension. The way they stretched genres and combined ambient with techno is phenomenal. Plus, if I was a part of it, I would actually be in the studio with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and then die of awe silently and peacefully at the corner.
Fofi aka Fo is a leading figure in the Greek dance music scene. She has played at all major clubs in the country, shared the decks with several international DJs and she holds the longest living residency at a club in the country, being a resident of Sodade2 BackStage for the past 20 years.
Brimming with curiosity and passion for electronic music, Virginia aka VRGN is an upcoming talent to watch. Within 2 years she has already played in some of the biggest venues in the Greek scene, sharing the decks with both Greek DJs and international ones such and also performed at the first edition of Sónar festival in Athens, in a B2B session with Fo.

There’s nothing like the open road. Possibilities unfold as the terrain whizzes by your window.
Hailing from the second largest country in the world means that road trips were a rite of passage. There’s a lot of ground to cover in Canada. Packing up and jumping in the car for a long drive to a different destination, through ever-changing seasons is a core memory for me. Driving several hours or even days means that I’ve logged a lot of kilometers on Canadian roads over the years — traversing those expansive landscapes with awe. These road trips stretched into married life for family gatherings, special events, school holidays, and glorious weekends at the cottage.
Our road trips took on a whole new dimension when we moved to Izmir, Türkiye in 2021. The roads no longer looked familiar. We drove with a sense of uncertainty and with, I must say, a slight feeling of trepidation.
Can traffic circle procedures really be that different here? Why is everyone speeding? Will small country lanes based on centuries old trails be wide enough to pass through? What if we get lost and we don’t speak Turkish?
Once we adjusted to the local norms of driving we revelled in the fact that our road…

Hello! I am Panagis Sarantos and this is the story of how the GDSC program and Harokopio University of Athens met each other for the first time — and it was quite a journey!
It all started in the summer of 2021 when I was chosen as Lead. It all happened thanks to Angelika Zaucha, community manager for the GDSC program in Europe.
Here’s an interesting story!
It was the summer of 2021. I was hanging out with my friends on a nice evening in the beautiful city of Athens in Neo Iraklio. While we were talking about our summer plans, I got a notification about a new email. I looked it up and saw the name “Angelika Zaucha” for the first time. She reached me via her personal email to ask me if I would accept the lead position because it was the last day to do that, and they did not get the response from my side.I was positively surprised. I rushed out and found all the other emails that had gone to the spam folder. I finalized the paperwork and became the GDSC Lead & Founder of Harokopio University of Athens (GDSC HUA).So… Thank you, Angelika!
First task, of course, was to form our Core Team. As a student of software engineering, I knew I could reach many developers and people in tech. But I also knew that our Club will need others to help with communications, planning and social media. After making my choice, I came up with these few useful tips on selecting core team members:
I have to say that I didn’t follow all the steps that I mentioned above, but now I know better and you should too.
It’s also important to establish a good relationship with your university and the faculty. Introduce yourself and the program to the authorities. We managed to do it, and our university fully supported all our plans and initiatives. At times it was difficult because of the pandemic, but we managed to overcome any obstacles. For example we managed to do a virtual event about AI & Blockchain for more than 260 unique viewers!
Yes, that’s right. Our first virtual event themed as “Applications of AI & Blockchain in Society & Industry” managed to hit more than 260 unique viewers. I have to tell you that I was really nervous at the beginning. We were live streaming on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms. We had guests from the industry and academia. It was quite a big hit and a pretty good experience for me personally as I got to work on my communication and public speaking skills. I’m always nervous making speeches, especially in front of a big audience. This time, I managed to overcome my fears and really learn a lot.
Solution Challenge, organized yearly by Google Developer Student Clubs, was something I knew I wanted to join right from the start, either by myself or with other members of our chapter.I felt that rush of excitement when I was watching the Top 10 chapters of 2021. I loved the idea of making a positive impact on the target group or the society in general.
We joined the competition as a team and worked hard on our solution. And we did it! Our team called “Bloodcall” got to the Top 10 Finalists of Solution Challenge 2022! It was amazing when we heard the news. Who would have thought, first year of GDSC HUA and we managed to have such a strong representation competing with so many other chapters across the world. Also for the record, we were the only Greek chapter to the Top 10, even the Top 50!
What a journey we had! GDSC was a fun and enriching experience from many different aspects:
I have to say that if you have the time during your time at the university, you should join the program, even if it seems hard at first glance — trust me, the experience is priceless. That was the journey of GDSC HUA on how it was founded and how we did in the first year of our existence. And the journey continues to the present — with new faces, fresh ideas and 2 co-leads. GDSC HUA is still active on campus and in the program. Pretty cool!
From my end, I want to thank all the members of the first core team for the amazing job we did for the chapter while also doing our best as students. Thanks: Manos, Mitsos, Thanos, Nikos, Thanasis, Alexandra, Petros and again Thanos!
I want to thank Harokopio University of Athens for a great cooperation and support. Special thank you goes to our Rector Mrs. Mara Nikolaidou and our Department Head Mr. Thomas Kamalakis.
Lastly I want to congratulate and thank again the Bloodcall team for the amazing job they did. Thank you: Thanasis, George, Stefanos and George.

The 2004 Olympic baseball stadium in Athens is currently not a baseball venue but a soccer venue. I went by in late 2012 and it looked ok. At least they are using it for a sport! See a lot of articles lately saying all the venues are falling apart or abandoned.
There is only one “main” olympic stadium still being used for baseball which is in barcelona host of the 1992 games. The 1996 olympic stadium was Fulton county stadium which was torn down,the 2000 olympic main stadium in Sydney was a showground for cattle and was only a temporary venue for the games. However west of Sydney is the 2nd olympic venue and it has been resurrected by mlb and is used in the abl league. The 2008 wukesong baseball olympic stadium in beijing and both Practice fields were reduced to rubble shortly after the games. So the Olympic baseball stadium in Athens below is still there. Maybe someday it will see a baseball game again.

For the next piece of my President’s Day getaway to Greece and Israel, I flew from Athens International Airport on Aegean to Tel Aviv, giving me a chance to check out the Aegean Business Class Lounge and the Aegean ground experience at its primary hub airport ahead of my flight to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my flight on Emirates from Newark to Athens, the Emirates ground experience at Newark, SAS Lounge at Newark, and stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked Welcome Pickups for my transfer from the InterCon to Athens International Airport (ATH). I scheduled a 2 pm pickup for my flight departing at 5:20 pm. The driver arrived promptly at around 1:45 pm. The ride to Athens airport was smooth and the traffic wasn’t too bad.
I booked the flight using American Express Membership Rewards earned on my American Express Platinum Card transferred to Aeroplan.
I found the check-in area quickly. Aegean had dedicated lines for its business-class customers as well as Star Alliance Gold customers. The line wasn’t too long when I arrived and I was served quickly.
I was not advised of any priority passport control or expedited security lanes for premium passengers. They also didn’t inform me of any lounge access despite its inclusion in my business class ticket.
There was no fast track for immigration, but I made it through pretty quickly. I didn’t initially see the signage for business class security so I got in the main line. When I did eventually notice signage for the business class line, I was already in the general line which was short so I stayed in it and did not move.
Once I cleared the formalities, I was inside the terminal. The Athens airport terminal was nicer and airier than I expected. I quickly found the entrance to the Aegean business lounge and made my way upstairs.
There were several lounges in the same area on a level above the terminal, and the Aegean lounge was clearly signed, but also recognizable from the strong Aegean blue. They are very consistent with their branding.
Curiously, the signs outside did not specifically note that Star Alliance Gold and premium passengers were welcome, as is common at Star Alliance lounges. This lounge, however, is indeed open to them and follows standard Star Alliance lounge access rules.
The lounge is accessed through automated electronic gates where your boarding pass is scanned, though staff was on hand.
Personally, I don’t mind the electronic gates as they allow quick entrance if your boarding pass is coded properly. But I do think being greeted by airline staff and thanked for your business is a nice touch that seems to be going away.
While Athens is Aegean’s primary hub, it’s primarily a medium and short-haul carrier and operates no widebody aircraft so my expectations for this lounge were measured. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the lounge, and the offerings. This is notable since I don’t think Athens sees much connecting traffic either, save for passengers traveling domestically within Greece.
The lounge was a very large space with several areas and buffet stations, with great views of the runway.
The restrooms were hidden in a corner. They were small considering the size of the lounge, though well appointed. Showers did not seem to be available.
Wifi was free and fast. Many seats were available with easy access to outlets which I always appreciate.
There was a large hot beverage area with a massive Nespresso machine and a very solid tea selection. For Americans, there was also drip coffee on hand.
I prefer cold coffee so I would have awarded bonus points if they had iced coffee or cold brew on hand, but that’s very rare in Europe, unfortunately.
A variety of mugs and glassware were available for the hot drinks. The hot beverages area also had various cookies and croissants.
Past the coffee station, there was another buffet area with a variety of pastries, yogurt, and prepared foods.
There were also salads, fresh chocolates, and finger foods. The hot food station had several items, though keeping kosher, I didn’t look too closely.
There was a great selection of beverages and a self-serve collection of wines and spirits. I appreciated that they had Greek beer and wine, and a lounge employee was happy to explain the different Greek beers to me and point me to his favorite.
There was also a selection of various newspapers and magazines, primarily in Greek. It would have been nice to see some English or international offerings though.
Keeping kosher, there was not much I can eat from the buffet, but reviews of the spread from my fellow passengers were pretty positive. I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate ahead of my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv.
Aegean does a reasonably good job with its business lounge, especially given its lack of widebody service. The space is large and comfortable space to relax before your flight. With plenty of seating, fast wifi, and ample food and beverage, it’s pretty solid for a long layover too. While the lack of showers was disappointing, there isn’t much long-haul traffic here so its less of an issue. I would not come early to experience this lounge, but I was very impressed by the offering given Aegean’s foot print.

As a lover of Percy Jackson, visiting Athens has been a dream of mine since I was basically old enough to read. I eventually decided to visit on my own as I had a writing deadline staring me in the face. On one hand, I needed to write thirty-thousand words in a week.
On the other, in that same week, I had found a studio apartment in Athens for £300. Oh! And I only had one week off my typical job. What should I do? I wondered.
Dreams were staring me down on both sides, until I realised, why not do both? So I did, I booked the flights, and off I went, laptop in tow!
I’ve travelled on my own since my first solo-inter-rail trip at seventeen, so this wasn’t new to me, but I was still nervous! As I can imagine you, reading this, would be nervous at the idea of visiting Athens as a solo traveller, especially if you’re an introvert girlie like me.
If you’re thinking about going, I bet the Parthenon is high on your list of attractions, so let’s break it down, because trust me, official guidance on this is confusing!
In this one article, we’ll be covering when you should visit the Parthenon, where to book tickets, as well as some incredible hidden gems at the Parthenon you should keep a look-out…

The Greek economy might be on life support, but at least one group in Athens is making the most of it and clearly thriving: graffiti artists. It has been suggested that Athens might be the best place in the world to be a graffiti artist right now. Or, as one of the practitioners puts it, “a little paradise for the graffiti artists.”
The city is in the middle of a graffiti epidemic. It’s a combination of high youth unemployment and underemployment, a general sense of unrest, and authorities being stretched too thin to do much about it. Frankly, the police have bigger problems. The result is an artistic free-for-all on the city’s streets.
Whether you want to call them vandals or street artists, they’ve been busy. Not all of it is new, of course, but there’s an awful lot of fresh paint adorning the walls downtown in the past five years or so. Shops, homes, bus stops, and pretty much any other wall — except, notably, places that have high security like banks and government buildings (mostly) — are covered in paint. Relatively few walls are spared.
There’s the usual scratchy hit-and-run tagging, but there’s also quite a lot that has taken real thought and effort to pull off. Some of it is youthful rebellion, some of it is political expression, and some of it is art in its purest form. And, of course, it’s constantly morphing, with new paint going over old.
And some of it is quite beautiful. Here’s a small sampling. Credit to the artists, whoever you are.
There’s a very interesting short documentary on graffiti in Athens that shows some of the painters in action. It’s called Alive in the Concrete, and you can watch it online here.

Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Peloponnesian War was the result of years of tension between two of the leading powers in the world of Ancient Greece, Athens, and Sparta. Athens was determined to build a widespread alliance that stretched all corners of the Mediterranean named the Delian League to provide protection against the Persians.
In doing so being the de facto leader they requested tribute to amass naval power and a crew to support it. Sparta was unsettled by this growing alliance and the power it wielded fearing that Athens’s intentions were more imperialistic and less a simple alliance.
By 431 B.C. the reserved feelings that Sparta held could no longer be contained resulting in a multi-decade-long war that ended with a shift of power and the downfall of Greek society. Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and the defeat of imperialistic Athens’s intentions had an ill effect on the Greek world.
The outcome of this war was more than just the decline of the once-great city-state of Athens, the rest of Greece crumbled around it. Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Greek city-states provide us with an interesting look at history, a civilization connected by language and religious belief but separated by geographical nature.
Although each of these city-states remained within close proximity of each other, and some of less geographical obstruction, little alliances were formed. For the majority of their existence, they remained and operated as individual city-states only joining in the defense of one another in times of war to protect the sanctity of their society.
Of the Greek city-states, two of them stood out from the rest and have survived the test of time by both providing their individual contributions to the ancient world which have left a lasting impact on society today. These Greek city-states were Athens and Sparta, two that could not have been more different, and two of whose internal strife would be the ruin of the Greek city-states.
The most distinguished difference between Athens and Sparta was their individual choice of government with each constructed to fit their societal ambitions. Athenians were notably democratic, which objectively defied the Spartan’s oligarchical form of government that supported its militaristic way of life.
Athens obtained this government identity following the Dark Age through the reforms of Solon who first rid the poor from debt slavery to the rich through an act of “disburdenment” a method he proudly boasts about in his poems when talking about mortgaged lands,
“He took away the record-stones that everywhere were planted, Before, Earth was in bondage, now she is free”
and when talking about citizens enslaved in foreign lands that he set free,
“uttering no longer Attic speech, So long and far their wretched wanderings And some who here at home in shameful servitude Were held.”[1]
Solon’s reforms would further establish a method of government that represented the people of Athens with his creation of a multi-tiered government to include a council (boule) of four hundred men who were chosen to hear public matters of the people before the matters were carried on to an elected assembly.[2]
Men like Cleisthenes and Pericles would help Athens to further develop its democratic progression by instilling further reforms that helped to better represent the Athenian citizens becoming an influence to later democratic styles of government to come.
The Spartan government was ruled by the few, a senate or Gerusia made of 30 members who were elected for good conduct and were “absolute masters of the mass of citizens.”[3] In an attempt to avoid corruption between the two kings and 28 council members of the Gerusia, five ephors were elected from the public to serve as moderators, and of whom did not rise within the presence of the kings as the members of the Gerusia did, for they served the people.[4]
This style of government was supportive of the Spartan way of life whose male population entered training for military service at the ripe age of 7 years old and whose service lasted a lifetime. The Spartans thought very highly of their way of life and questioned the rise of Athenian democracy regarding it as weak as evidenced by the words of Lycurgus. When Lycurgus was questioned about democracy in Sparta, he simply answered
“Do you first establish a democracy in your house,”
He further downplays the significance of democracy and further promotes the effectiveness of Sparta’s oligarchy through his analogy of two puppies, both of which were of the same kin but each had notably different upbringings, one was catered to, lived indoors, and was fed regularly, the other hunted and trained in the field.[5]
When Lycurgus later presented the dogs before an assembly of the public he did so by placing food the dogs were accustomed to before them, and as expected the house-trained dog opted for the cheap food while the hunter sought the wild hare in response to these actions Lycurgus said,
“You see, fellow-citizens, that these dogs belong to the same stock, but by virtue of the discipline to which they have been subjected they have turn out utterly different from each other, and you also see that training is more effective than nature for good.”[6]
These societal differences would end up with the two leading Greek city-states entering into an unlikely alliance when the Athenians sought protection against Spartan interference in their own government by promising King Darius of the Persian Empire “earth and water” which was a sign of submission required of all alliance seekers with the Persian Empire, and when Athens did not fulfill their promise King Darius sought retribution against all of Greece.[7]
The outcome of the Persian War was not enough to preserve the unlikely alliance between Athens and Sparta, and for the next several decades they would walk separate paths as equal to their societal differences until they met once again but this time as enemies on the battlefield.
Athenians learned from the Persian War that they were at a financial disadvantage in warfare when compared to the Spartans who were a militaristic state that had an ample supply of endless soldiers, and to the likes of the Persian Empire with a vast network of client states.
When Athens took the helm of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League that sought to protect all of Greece from future Persian invasions from the eastern Mediterranean and in doing so, they adopted the Persian method of funding war knowing that the funding that a single city-state could provide alone was not enough to yield the success they were trying to accomplish so the payment of a fixed tribute from each alliance member annually was necessary.[8]
This decision served to be favorable for the Delian League allowing them to make quick use of the funds in its continuous campaign to expel Persians from harbors across the Aegean Sea, to destroy Persia’s fleet, and to liberate Ionia’s poleis.[9]
This financial arrangement would prove to be even more favorable to the Athenians when they undermined other league members to create an Athenian Empire to which they were subject and their financial contributions allowed the funding of elite Athenian sailors and hoplites who could endure campaigns and sieges lasting from a few months to a few years.[10]
Sparta, who was the original intended leader of the alliance that became the Delian League slipped back into its isolationistic state shortly after its formation and after Sparta was replaced as its leader by Athens. Even from Sparta’s state of isolation, Sparta watched on as Athens gained momentum in its rise of becoming an empire and its ascendance into the Golden Age afforded by the funds of the Delian League’s tributes. As this unfolded Sparta’s fear of an Athenian shift into imperialism heightened, and with justification.
Athens’s transformation into an imperialistic empire is best described by a certain characteristic quality that further distinguished itself from its closest competition the Spartans. This quality is known as “daring” and encompasses Athens’s traits of restlessness and expansionism in its rise to power and is best described by Thucydides in his recording of Pericles’ Funeral Oration that occurred during the Peloponnesian War where he records Pericles’s attention to the sacrifices made by fallen Athenians whose courage, virtue, and “daring” should be a model for Athenians who have survived for it has allowed Athens to compel every sea and every land to yield to their “daring” enabling them to be immortalized through monuments everywhere of themselves.[11]
Furthermore, Athenian “daring” is a catalyst for a theory that was composed by Thucydides that he believes explains the inevitable war that happened between Athens and Sparta. This theory is the theory of Hegemonic War.
Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War is a concept that he believed to be as true as human nature and one that is to be repeated throughout all of human history with one civilization driven by three fundamental influences: interest, pride, and fear, to advance its position of wealth and power until another civilization of the same interests intervenes in an attempt to stop them.[12]
Athens’s use of its position within the Delian League as a vessel in its ascendance to power saw the city-state grow ruthless, and become an aggressive bully when its authoritative role was challenged by league members who no longer sought an alliance with them. This issue was not self-contained and true to Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War when Athens and Sparta butted heads when Athens failed to resolve conflicts of interest that created issues with members of Sparta’s own alliance, the Peloponnesian League, leading to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.
In short, the cause of the Peloponnesian War can be attributed to Athenian’s “daring,” its own justification for imperialism, and Athens’s interference in the Peloponnesian Leagues matters. Sparta tried to settle conflicts of interest between Athens and its own league the Peloponnesian League through questionable measures when it threatened the act of war against Athens and its allies if Athens did withdraw its siege of Potidaea, a rebelling member of the Delian League with connection to Corinth of the Peloponnesian League, and abstain from its imposed economic sanctions against the Megareans in all ports within the Athenian dominion, which Athens saw justification for doing because they had tilled holy grounds and received revolted Athenian slaves.[13]
Additionally, Sparta’s stern ultimatum to the Athenians was heavily influenced by one of its strongest allies in the Peloponnesian League, Corinth, who urged the Spartans to a speedy intervention to the injustices being carried out by Athens, or Corinth itself and other Peloponnesian League members would seek a new alliance to join.[14]
Moreover, Athens’s refusal to meet the terms of Sparta’s ultimatum resulted in a three-decade-long war that saw Sparta fight against the injustices of Athenian Imperialism which they successfully accomplished by standing as victors at the end of the war. However, the war had adverse actions on the Greek city-states as a whole, many fell into economic hardships as a result of the war, and some were influenced by the two prominent Greek city-states of opposing governments to carry out civil conflict against their own people.
The Golden Era of Athens and its influence on the ancient world ended, and the shift of power to Sparta as the leading Greek city-state proved to be an utter failure, as previous foreshadowed in its leading role as a member of the what became the Delian League, resulting in years of conflict to follow allowing the Greeks to become susceptible to its latter absorption into the Macedonian Empire.
Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and its overnight ascendance to hegemony over Greece proved to have detrimental consequences for all of the city-states.
Sparta, as Athens did before them, flexed its power throughout Greece proving to be just as bad or even worse for the Greek people than Athens was before them as evidenced by the choice of Sparta’s former allies aligning themselves with Athens in an attempt to hinder its control. Thriving in victory Sparta promoted Admiral Lysander to carry out an instilled aggressive policy that reformed city-state governments throughout Greece by placing harmosts (military governors) who forcibly established oligarchies as well as required tribute from all those they had conquered even though before feeling such power they had not even used coined money but now benefitted from the annual tribute of more than a thousand subjects.[15]
In response to these actions and backed by Persian money an alliance was formed between Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes who swore to defeat Sparta.[16] This conflict was the Corinthian War (395–387 B.C.).
The Corinthian War finished in a similar fashion to the Peloponnesian War with Sparta standing in victory benefiting from late financial support from Persia, when Persia switched sides leaving behind its original alliance with Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes. This would not be the final conflict between the Greek city-states in their pursuit of hegemony status, alliances would be reformed and reconstructed, and the title of hegemony would be passed amongst city-states until the mid-fourth century B.C. During this period of time, the Spartans suffered a dreadful defeat at the hands of the Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra (471 B.C.) that halted Sparta’s reign of power.[17]
This nearly century-long struggle to obtain the status of hegemony left adverse actions among the Greek city-states. The nearly century-long constant warring exhausted resources, depleted civilizations, and rendered each city-state barely capable of maintaining its own state, each becoming susceptible to rising power to the North.
The Macedonians under the leadership of King Philip II took advantage of the exhausted Greek city-states in pursuit of gaining hegemony status for his growing empire with little resistance to his efforts besides a single conflict against Athens and Thebes in 338 B.C. known as the Battle of Chaeronea. Athens and Thebes refused to yield to King Philip and the Macedonians like northern Greek city-states had done before them because as explained by the Athenian orator Demosthenes the Macedonians were not Greek or even related to the Greeks and not even a barbarian from an honorable place of mention so submitting to them was insulting to the sanctity of Greece.[18]
The defeat of Athens and Thebes by Macedonia proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Greek power. Even though they retained a sense of freedom, any influence the Greek people once held on the Ancient World through their acts of politics and foreign policy completely ceased to exist, now they were subjects to the Macedonian Empire.
The outcome of the Persian War set the scene for the inevitable war between two of the greatest Greek city-states of their time, Athens, and Sparta. Following the war, Athens accepted a position as leader of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League, with great ambitions to rid the Persian Empire from the east Mediterranean and the rest of Greece.
They were successful, to say the least, but with a stronghold on this great power, their ambitions turned personal. As the Spartans watched on from isolation following the Persian War, Athens used the Delian League for its own personal gain, in the hold of a massive and lethal navy, and with ample funds supplied by Greek city-state tributes they grew into a formidable empire.
Athens’s growth did not end there, soon they turned imperialistic, whether it was for Sparta’s own personal feelings of disdain for Athens, or its urge to protect Greece, the two city-states met with war in 431 B.C. The results of the Peloponnesian War would prove to yield irrevocable and unintentional consequences when the victor proved to be just as bad as the perceived threat they dethroned.
Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain
Centuries ago, a radiant jewel of civilization — Athens — crumbled. Not merely under the weight of Spartan swords, but under the erosion of reason, the rise of demagogues, and the silencing of truth.
The Peloponnesian War wasn’t just a historical battle. It was the death knell of a civilization that gave the world democracy, philosophy, and artistic brilliance — and then extinguished its light.
Today, as we scroll through headlines filled with disinformation, political chaos, and moral exhaustion, one can’t help but wonder:
Are we living through our own Peloponnesian moment?
The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) pitted the democratic city-state of Athens against the oligarchic city-state of Sparta in a 27-year conflict that decimated both.
Athens, confident in its intellect and naval prowess, made a series of hubristic miscalculations. It overreached, misled by populist leaders and reckless ambition, ultimately losing the war and itself.
The fall of Athens didn’t just shake the Greek world. It produced a spiritual and philosophical crisis that gave rise to one of history’s most powerful responses: the life and death of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato.
Socrates — a soldier-turned-philosopher — walked the streets of Athens, challenging assumptions, confronting power, and questioning the nature of justice, truth, and virtue.
He didn’t write. He asked.
And in a society growing fragile under the weight of war and rhetoric, questions became dangerous.
In 399 BCE, Athens condemned him to death. His student, Plato, watched his mentor die — and with that, watched the Athenian soul fracture.
Plato didn’t just mourn Socrates. He responded with a blueprint for a better world.
In The Republic, he paints a chilling portrait of democratic decay: how freedom becomes license, how public opinion overrides wisdom, and how a desire for equality can spiral into tyranny.
His solution? A society governed not by the loudest, but the wisest philosopher-kings trained in truth, detached from greed, and committed to justice.
Now, let’s fast forward 2,500 years.
Across nations, we see strongmen rising, liberties shrinking, and democracy faltering under the same forces that once undid Athens.
We call it progress. But in the quiet moments, history whispers a warning.
Plato foresaw the cycle of governance:
We are, arguably, at the fragile edge between stages four and five.
And the pattern? It’s not new. It’s timeless.
If Athens fell — and from its ashes, philosophy rose — what must we do to avoid repeating that collapse?
Here’s what the legacy of Socrates and Plato implores us to reclaim:
“The unexamined life is not worth living.” — Socrates But perhaps more urgently today: “The unexamined society is not worth sustaining.”
Athens gave us the tools to think. But when it stopped thinking, it destroyed itself.
Today, we possess far greater power — nuclear, digital, economic — but not necessarily greater wisdom.
If we let emotion eclipse reason, let division replace dialogue, and let power overpower truth, then we will fall, not because we were unaware, but because we were indifferent.
So ask yourself:
Are we the next Athens? Or will we, finally, choose a wiser path?

The sun, a dying ember in the twilight, cast long shadows across the Athenian marketplace. Among the stalls of olives and sandals, Socrates, his brow etched with the wrinkles of a thousand dialogues, sat hunched on a block of worn stone. His eyes, like pools of wisdom, watched the bustling throng, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames of oil lamps.
“Friend,” rasped a voice from behind, “the shadows grow long. What truths do you glean from this day?”
Socrates turned to see Aristotle, his beard a silver cascade down his chest, his gaze sharp as a polished stylus.
“The dance of life, dear friend,” Socrates replied, “a waltz of appetites and aspirations. We spin on a spectrum, woven of threads both base and divine — the hunger for sustenance, the yearning for knowledge, the sting of guilt, the glimmer of hope.”
He gestured to a young woman haggling over a basket of figs, her eyes bright with cunning, her smile tinged with shame. “In her, the primal barter, the dance of need and debt. Money, a cold coin, echoes the ancient whisper of sacrifice, the price we pay for survival, for power, for absolution.”
He pointed to a group of men debating philosophy under the olive trees, their voices rising in passionate waves. “And here, the fire of the mind, the struggle to transcend the limitations of flesh. They seek answers in the stars, meaning in the dust, a testament to our insatiable hunger for significance, our defiance against the indifferent abyss of oblivion.”
Aristotle nodded, his voice deep as the Aegean. “Yet, even in the shadows, there flickers a light. Ritual, the heartbeat of community, binds us together in the face of the unknown. In shared sacrifice, in the rhythm of chanted prayers, we find solace, strength, a sense of purpose that transcends the individual.”
He looked towards the temple on the hill, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. “But the shadows grow, Socrates. The marketplace, once vibrant with the hum of shared stories, now echoes with the click of screens, each a window to a solitary universe. The third space, the crucible of connection, fades, replaced by the atomization of the digital.”
Socrates sighed, a rumble in his chest. “A new dawn approaches, friend, a dawn where ghosts of information dance in the ether, and the stories we tell ourselves become the scaffolding of our reality. We must choose, then, with clear eyes and open hearts. Will we build walls of data, fortresses of self, or will we weave tapestries of shared experience, where the echoes of laughter mingle with the whispers of wisdom, and the spark of humanity burns bright in the face of the coming night?”
The two figures fell silent, their words hanging heavy in the twilight air. The marketplace hummed on, oblivious to their philosophical dance. But in the quiet space between their thoughts, a seed of possibility was sown, a glimmer of hope that perhaps, even in the face of shadows and screens, the story of humanity was far from over.
The stars began to prick the darkening canvas of the sky, each a tiny eye watching the ancient dance unfold. And in the murmur of the wind, a whisper echoed, a question not just for Socrates and Aristotle, but for all of us: what story will we write with our actions, thoughts and intentions when none concord?
In the poisoned vineyard of the web, nightshade and hemlock intertwine, their bitter fruit cultivated by a dark alliance: demagogues, serpents with forked tongues, weaving fear and falsehood, and aristocrats, spiders of silver and silk, manipulating the strings of information. These power figures, fueled by an insatiable hunger for control, are the origin of a festering inequality, where shadows of misinformation stretch long and menacing.
Children, once innocent buds sprouting in the communal garden, are twisted into warped reflections of the past. Demagogues, like cruel gardeners, graft onto them the bitter fruits of division and hate, while aristocrats, like watchful vultures, prey on their vulnerability. Escape from this suffocating garden becomes a desperate scramble for a centralized haven, a fortress of ritual and symbolic power, built not on shared values, but on the fear of the encroaching darkness.
The sun of communal ritual, once a beacon of unity, casts a dwindling light. Its dawn, a sinful song and story, faded with the rise of individualism, replaced by the harsh neon glare of screens, each a solitary window to a curated universe. Dusk descends, painted in the muted tones of isolation, where third spaces, once bustling havens of connection, lie fallow, echoing with the hollow hum of digital ghosts.
But even in the eclipse of community, there glimmers a stubborn hope. Seeds of resistance, dormant but waiting, stir beneath the poisoned soil. In the quiet defiance of shared laughter, in the whispered acts of kindness, in the flickering flames of shared stories, lies the potential for a new dawn. A dawn where technology, wielded not as a weapon of exclusion, but as a bridge of connection, allows for the reemergence of communal ritual, not as a rigid fortress, but as a vibrant tent, open to all, where diverse voices orchestrate a symphony of shared humanity abilities.
This is the challenge before us: to reclaim the web from the poisoners, to nurture the seeds of connection, and to rediscover the lost art of ritual, not as a tool of control, but as a celebration of our shared existence. This is the path to escape the garden of shadows, to break free from the digital atomization, and to step into the sunlit clearing of a future where community, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes of isolation, its wings strong and vibrant, casting a benevolent shade on the children of tomorrow.
The Athenian sun beat down on the bustling agora, its rays glinting off olives piled high on a stall. Socrates, sandals dusty and brow furrowed, leaned against the fragrant wood, a gadfly amidst the buzzing marketplace. Aristotle, eyes keen and gait confident, strode towards him, a predator seeking intellectual prey.
“Ah, Aristotle!” Socrates’ voice, sharp as Attic salt, sliced through the cacophony. “Come to barter insights, like merchants haggling over your precious olives?”
Aristotle chuckled, a deep rumble that resonated with the city’s heartbeat. “Indeed, Socrates. My thirst for knowledge burns as bright as this midday sun. Today, I seek your scalpel of logic to dissect the enigma of humanity. Tell me, is it true that death’s denial fuels our cultural ascent?”
Socrates’ beard twitched as he considered. “Hmm, a bold claim, my friend! Is it not fear, rather, that drives us to carve rituals from the raw stone of existence? These sacrifices, offerings to appease the unseen, are they not testaments to our primitive dread of oblivion?”
Aristotle’s eyes glinted like polished bronze. “But does not this very struggle against annihilation spark the flame of ingenuity? Look how technics, born from ritual, crafts tools not just for survival, but for creation! In this ‘Ritual World,’ as you call it, does not sacrifice, the conscious giving, pave the path to something grander?”
Socrates’ hand darted out, intercepting a passing fly. “I concede, dear Aristotle, ingenuity dances alongside fear. Yet, even your grand tapestry of cultural transcendence, is it not woven with threads of guilt and the sting of our limitations? Money, that cold symbol of debt and desire, does it not resonate with our primal shame, pushing us towards both heroism and the gnawing need for expiation?”
Aristotle nodded, a wry smile playing on his lips. “True, the clink of coins echoes with both ambition and regret. But is it not through this very tension, this economic pulse, that the Ritual World thrives? Power and expiation, like two sides of the same coin, fuel both the triumphs of heroes and the humbling rituals of forgiveness.”
“So, we paint different facets of the same diamond, Aristotle,” Socrates quipped, a playful glint in his eyes. “You, the grand architect of systems, see culture as a cosmic dance against extinction. I, the gadfly, poke at the underbelly, revealing the raw nerves of guilt and longing that drive us.”
Aristotle’s hand traced the lines on a nearby olive. “Yet, in our contrasting melodies, is there not a harmony? Your dissection lays bare the human condition, while my synthesis offers a broader canvas. Together, do we not illuminate the full spectrum of this curious journey, from dust to aspirations?”
Socrates’ voice, gravelly yet warm, filled the air. “Indeed, friend. In this marketplace of ideas, our voices intertwine, a chorus echoing across the ages. For the struggle for meaning, for transcendence, is woven into the very fabric of our being. And in this shared pursuit, the sting of doubt and the glimmer of hope become the rhythm of our existence.”
The sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched across the marketplace. Socrates and Aristotle, their voices blending, continued their philosophical duet, a dance of logic and wonder marveling at the mystery in the vibrant heart of Athens.
This is the story we must write, not with nightshade and hemlock, but with courage, compassion, and the enduring human spirit. For in the end, it is not walls that define us, but the echoes of shared laughter, the warmth of a helping hand, and the stories that bind us together under the vast, starlit sky.

The heart of Athens’ historic center is experiencing a revival. The 27-acre district is bounded by three of Athens’ most historic squares: Syntagma, Ommonia, and Monistraki. The Commercial Triangle, locally referred to as “Trigono,” is a working district, with commercial activity dating back to the 19th century.
Despite its historic and geographic significance, the neighborhood fell into disrepair in the 1980s. As a result, many buildings were vacated. By 2016, 17% of ground floor and 45% of upper floor spaces were vacant, while a survey of shopkeepers in the area found that 50–70% believed graffiti, lack of cleanliness, and illegal parking were serious issues. While there were pockets of economic activity, the neighborhood was not pedestrian-friendly and it was struggling to attract new investment.
As a city emerging from an eight-year crisis, Athens is making real progress in charting a new future. Under the leadership of Mayor Giorgos Kaminis, the city is employing creative solutions to improve quality of life, and his focus on cultivating community pride and optimism is making a real impact. One of his cornerstone projects has been the revitalization of the Trigono neighborhood.
Since 2015, Bloomberg Associates has worked with Mayor Kaminis to advance his priority projects by sharing expertise from the global network of client cities. Bloomberg Associates is the international, philanthropic consulting arm of Bloomberg Philanthropies, providing select mayors and city governments with custom consultation and mentorship.
This episode features conversations with Alexandros Kambouroglou, the Executive Director of the Athens Partnership, and Elina Dallas, the Project Manager for the Trigono program. Jake Elder of Bloomberg Associates Sustainability Team joined them in Athens.

Athens is often hailed as the birthplace of democracy. But Athens was also the birthplace of gay culture. Openly practiced and celebrated, homosexuality was part of the social fabric of ancient Athens. Today, the Greek capital remains a very gay-friendly city, with countless gay and lesbian bars, many openly gay celebrities, and a vibrant LGBTQI+ community. Athens Pride, the country’s biggest festival of diversity, is held every June.
Just like in every vibrant European city, Athens can be a handful for a first-time visitor. Here’s all the LGBTQI+ legalities you’ll need to know and all the organizations you’ll may have to contact, while in Athens.
Legal Status on discrimination
In Greece there are laws prohibiting discrimination based on sex, race, age, or sexual orientation; civil unions are legal, but not full-fledged same-sex marriages; a status many government officials say will soon change. The Mayor of Athens has openly supported same-sex marriages and many couples wait for it.
Homophobia
There has been a growing concern over homophobia, due to the rise of the far right in Greece because of the crisis. Although that was true, homophobic incidents are rare. The biggest opposition to lgbtqi+ issues is held by a few priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, who are by and large regarded as “relics” by most Greeks, who see the world change for the better. There have been fewer attacks on gay couples in the last 5 years, than there are fingers in one’s hand. Athenians don’t tolerate intolerance.
LGBTQI+ Organizations
There are many organizations for the LGBTQI+s of Greece and the vast majority of them is headquartered in Athens. OLKE is the most prominent one, pushing out the non-discriminatory agenda. For the young crowd, Colour Youth is a fresh and very active organization (famous for its parties) that acts more as a community of young lgbtqi+ people who want to have fun and claim their rights, than an old school non-profit organization. Positive Voice welcomes HIV positive people, and friends, who wish to stand for their community and help in any way they can towards a zero infections day. Athens CheckPoint is an NGO that offers quick and reliable HIV blood checks for free. It’s located near Monastiraki Square (Metro Line 1&3) and have very discreet staff.
Gay Publications
The oldest and most read LGBTQI+ publication in Athens is Antivirus Magazine, a Greek speaking, bi-monthly free press, that for over a decade chronicles the news and events of the gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer and intersex community of Athens and Greece. You’ll find it at bars, universities, hot-dog joints and many other places that support the equal-rights movement. One step further, Colourful Planet is a bookshop-cafe that has also turned into a publishing house. Young (or just new) LGBTQI+ writers are welcome here, to find a publishing outlet for their voice to be heard.
The Greek Capital is always ready for big colourful parades and out festivals! For over a decade Athens hosts one of the most dynamically growing Prides in Europe every June and the last couple of years, the Outview Festival of Athens draws international attention with its screenings and guests!
Athens Pride
The City of Athens wears its rainbow colours with pride every year, on the second Saturday of June, at Syntagma (it used to be held in Klafthmonos Square, but now it moved to the city’s main square). With countless events and parties leading up to the big parade, Athens Pride has developed to one of the most formidable in Europe. It’s sponsored by the City of Athens and it’s a custom for the parade to start on the Athens Mayor’s mark! It was in 2004 that the first Gay Pride was held and since then, more and more people and corporations support it and attend to its events. Nowadays it’s lauded as one of the most dynamically growing prides in the western world.
Outview Festival
Athens annual Queer Film Festival, although relatively new, has gained extreme momentum and is already included in the most important LGBTQI+ events and Cinema Festivals of the Country. Every year, for a week in May, a downtown cinema theatre (usually the state-owned Greek Film Archive’s cinema) hosts an international festival celebrating movies from all over the world, made by LGBTQI+ creators or with a strong LGBTQI+ theme. Directors, actors, screenwriters and more attend the festival, that also organizes forums and workshops for those who wish to learn more about queer cinema.
Athens is notorious for its nightlife! Expect even more eleganza extravaganza at the city’s many LGBTQI+ clubs and pubs! And not just for the Dancing Queens! LGBTQI+ travellers will feel welcome to any cafe and bar of Athens, as the young and hip crowd is always friendly and up for a talk. For those who love to show their dancing skills, the Athenian soundtrack is a loud playlist for every taste! Disco divas, pop guilty pleasures, progressive electronica, Greek popular music? You name it! There is more than meets the eye in those small gay and lesbian bars.
Keramikos
Usually referred to as “Gazi”, the Keramikos area, at the Keramikos Metro Line 3 station, plays host to the most famous gay clubs in Greece. Some have over a decade of constant operation and are still as popular as ever! Open seven nights a week, the party never stops here, for every lgbtqi+ night owl. Bears, next door guys and gals, fashion forward people, trendy celebrities are among the ones joining in the fun at Gazi. Out for a cocktail, a beer or just a glass of wine, whatever someone looks for, will find it here, including many hot Greeks! The square at the centre of Gazi area also has many cafes, burger joints, vromiko sandwich places and even a pasta to go, cause gay or straight, at the end of a long night out, you’ll want something to sink your teeth into.
Historical Centre
If you wish to start the night earlier, you could visit the Agias Eirinis square; it’s full of the hip “in crowd” having coffee, a snack or their first drinks, at the many beautiful cafe/bars around. A relatively recent Athenian highlight, the square is now considered the downtown meeting point and place to be for all aspiring fashionistas. One can sit at its numerous gay-friendly places and read a book, consult a map, or simply watch the passerby's. In the paved streets from Monastiraki to Syntagma, you’ll find the rainbow heart of Athens beating, until the sun comes up in the morning.
Victoria Square
Not hip, nor cool, the area around Victoria station (Metro Line 1) was once the go-to-place for gays, when there was no concept of equal rights movement, and many people were still in the closet. The many hidden bars gained fame back then, but also a devoted following, so it’s no surprise that some have remained, although they’re now more of “boy bars”. Many immigrants flock to these places, since most live in the area of Victoria, giving these gay bars a quite different and unique oriental attitude.
Koukles
Koukles deserves a chapter on its own. Founded in 1994, the club originally aimed at helping Drag Queens find a place to express themselves. But as we all know if you put many Drag Queens together the results are either Disastrous or Fabulous! At Koukles, fabulousness is mandatory! While many clubs offer Drag Shows (like BeQueer ), in Koukles they're on every night! Fierce and Fun take central stage as International Divas fight for the spotlight and our applause. Word of wisdom: Make reservations if you want to get a table!
How can one not fall in love with Athens? The Acropolis, the Nightlife, the Food, the Sun, the Sea. Would you think that only in Mykonos you’d find gay beaches in Greece? Think again! Athens will make you want to “Shante -Stay!” all year round! Pack your sexiest swimwear, cause in Athens, you’re going to need it! Being a stone-throw away from the sea, the city serves as the perfect place to combine sightseeing and summer fun!
Limanakia
Just like there is no such thing as a gay island, but then, there’s Mykonos, there is no such thing as a gay beach, but then there’s Limanakia. Easily accessible by bus or car, right before the coastal suburb of Varkiza, Limanakia is a rocky beach that started off as a nudist beach but evolved into a semi-nude gay beach. Take a dive at the cool deep blue waters and be careful when you walk of the rock, as it gets slippery. Here you’ll find many singles trying to hook-up and couples wanting to get intimate, or simply looking for a tan without swimsuit markings. The atmosphere gets very flirty during sunset when the sun dives in the Saronic waters.
Mavro Lithari
Following the road to Sounio, a few kilometers before the Temple of Poseidon, you’ll find not one, but three small gulfs that welcome gays! Right at the 48 km of the road you’ll come across three small gulfs that are the hotspot of hip people! A lovely mix of Athenians wishing to relax and enjoy a beer under the sun, without over-thinking or feeling ashamed to go skinny dipping, usually sunbathes here; there’s also a canteen to one of the rocky gulfs, which serves coffees and snacks to-go, an always important aspect to anything Greek.
Kakia Skala
Before millions of people lived in Athens, when its suburbs were nothing more than small villages, western Attika used to go to Kineta for a quick swim. White pebbled beaches and calm waters made a perfect getaway during a sweltering day. But then the sudden overpopulation of Athens altered everything, industrializing a big part of Attika, with a huge effect on sea pollution. Since then, many years have passed and the beaches from Kakia Skala all the way to Kineta welcome again Athenians during sizzling summer days. Somewhere well hidden, under the National Highway that passes through, lies a small rocky beach with pebbles that is for nudists and gays.
Today the Greek capital is a very gay-friendly destination, hosting the biggest Pride Parade in the country and offering numerous queer activities! However, the Athenian history offers an abundance of queer cultural moments. Homosexuality was openly practiced, often with official sanction, until Christianity took over. Plus: Plato’s famous Symposium takes place in the house of Agathon, a gay Athenian tragic poet who was the lifelong companion of Pausanias, when he receives a prize for his first tragedy.

At the entrance to the Acropolis, there is a plaque that commemorates Athens’ contributions to Western civilisation. The city has had an outsized impact in shaping the trajectory of modern democracy, philosophy, architecture, and drama, and I was excited to explore the place at the centre of it all: the Acropolis.
My day started at 9am after a quick breakfast of cold cuts and fresh fruit at the hostel. I had opted for a guided tour of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Acropolis Museum, and I met my guide and our small group at the Acropolis metro station. Though I did spot a number of Indians on my flight to Athens yesterday, my group were all Americans and Canadians, with I being the sole representative from the eastern hemisphere.
Our guide had warned us that its best that we stay together and start the tour early, as three cruise ships had docked at Piraeus the previous day, and they would all descend on the Acropolis today, leading it to be an extremely crowded day to explore. By the time we reached the Acropolis, the crowds had started to thicken, with it being almost impossible to not be accosted by the sea of humanity at every turn.
The term Acropolis is from the Greek words akron, meaning highest point, and polis, meaning city. Though the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, it was Pericles who coordinated the construction of the buildings that the area is famous for today: the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Over the years, countless wars and unthinkable acts of destruction, coupled with quests for religious and political hegemony have seriously damaged these magnificent structures, yet they still stand majestically over the city of Athens to tell their tale.
The Acropolis, though in reality (that honour goes to Lycabettus Hill, which I visited later) not the highest point of the city, rises 150m above the sea level, offering its occupants a commanding view of the city and its surroundings. On a clear day, one can see all the way to the port of Piraeus, enabling the rulers to have enough time to scramble resources in the case of an invasion. The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta was primarily a battle for maritime control, as the victor of the war was guaranteed control over crucial maritime routes across the Mediterranean Sea. As my flight was descending onto the tarmac of Athens’ airport yesterday, I did notice the lack of vegetation across the terrain — the hills are pockmarked with shrub vegetation and the occasional olive tree, a contrast from the lush green vegetation that I’m used to back home in Kerala. Athens’ maritime prowess was thus a result of sheer necessity — the poor soil of the Attica region meant that the city’s only route to power and wealth was overseas trade, making a significant maritime presence key to their domination.
Our first stop on the tour was the Theatre of Dionysus, built between the fourth and the fifth century BC. Walking amidst its ruins, I was reminded of the contribution of the Greek tragedians: Sophocles, Euripedes, and Aesychlus, all of whom staged plays at this very theatre. There is also significant evidence to show that Aristophanes, the Father of Comedy, staged his play The Clouds at the very same venue, which eventually led to the trial and the subsequent condemning to death of Socrates. Artistic expression has always played an important role in maintaining the balance of power in society, and we will always have the great Greek playwrights to thank for their contributions.
A narrow path carved onto the slopes of the hill is the only way up and down the Acropolis, and as time passed by, the entire route became crowded with tourists. In most cities in Europe, over-tourism has become an increasing concern, with Athens being no exception. Our group slowly made way to the top, with the magnificent edifice of the Parthenon slowly coming into view. A former temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is the definitive epitome of Greek architecture, an enduring symbol of democracy and Western civilisation.
Tired from climbing the modest hill in the Athenian summer, we gathered under the shade of an olive tree for some respite, when my eye caught sight of a plaque detailing the foundation myth of the city of Athens. According to Greek mythology, both Poseidon and Athena wanted to be the patron deity of the city, and with Zeus being unable to resolve the conflict, the competing Gods decided to have a contest and leave it to the citizens of the city to decide which gift was better than the other. Poseidon struck his spear to the ground and a spring sprang up, and Athena gave birth from the ground to a magnificent olive tree. The water from the spring was salty and not very useful, on the other hand, the olive tree provided the citizens with food, shade, oil, and wood, and the city was named after Athena, who then became the protector of this city, which would grow to become the most powerful city in all of Greece.
The Parthenon is a stunning example of Greek architecture, with architectural flourishes adorning all of its surfaces. Only a few of the frieze, mentopes, and pediments, which topped its magnificent Doric columns, now stand, with a few of them now in the Acropolis Museum, and the remaining, unsurprisingly, now housed in the British Museum in London, carefully smuggled out of then Ottoman Greece, by British nobleman and diplomat Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin. The Elgin Marbles, as they are now called, are the Greek kohinoor, and the Greek have also been lobbying the hallways of Whitehall for its repatriation.
We then made our way back down to head to the last stop for the day: the Acropolis Museum. A magnificent structure of glass and steel, the museum houses remnants excavated from the neighbourhood surrounding the Acropolis. Consisting of three levels, the museum is a captivating blend of ancient and modern. The ground level showcases an impressive collection of ancient statues, excavated from the numerous sanctuaries that dotted the area. However, the star of the museum is undoubtedly the Parthenon Gallery, a breathtaking glass atrium constructed in the same dimensions as the Parthenon itself. The gallery holds the famous Parthenon frieze, the metopes, and the pediments, all arranged to mirror their original positions on the Parthenon. During earlier requests to the British for the return of the Elgin Marbles, the British Government made the claim that the Greeks had “no suitable location where they could be displayed”, and the creation of the Acropolis Museum aims to remedy this shortcoming in the Greek request for reattribution.
Our tour ended at 2pm and I felt drawn to explore more of the city’s historic charm. I began by strolling through Makrigianni’s streets and towards Plaka. As I walked the quiet streets of Plaka, the calmness of Athens became evident as birdsong filled the air, a rare sound in a bustling city. After a quick lunch of a gyro, I headed to the Athens National Garden, a green space in the heart of the city. Nestled between the park and the magnificent Hadrian’s Temple of Olympian Zeus is the Zappeion, a palatial building built for the Olympic Games. Named after Evangelos Zappas, one of the pioneers of the modern Olympic Games, it is now used for meetings and ceremonies and holds a place in history as the site where Greece’s ascension to the Eurozone was signed in May 1979.
As I wrapped up my explorations for the day, I found myself ruminating over the city’s striking blend of the old and the new, a harmonious co-existence of historical legacy and contemporary vibrance. Athens is a city that has continued to evolve without losing sight of its illustrious past, and as I continue my journey deeper into this gorgeous city, I’m reminded that every step taken in Athens is a step through time, an experience that only few other cities in the world can provide.

“If Athens shall appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.” — Pericles
During our recent family holiday in Greece in May 2023, we had the incredible opportunity to explore the ancient sites of Athens.
While the Acropolis and the iconic Parthenon were undoubtedly awe-inspiring, it was our visit to the Ancient Agora that truly transported us back in time. It provided us with a genuine glimpse into ancient Athenian life.
“The Ancient Agora of Athens is an archaeological site located beneath the northwest slope of the Acropolis. The word “agora” applies to an assembly of people and by extend marks the gathering place. In modern Greek the term means “marketplace”.”
The Ancient Agora of Athens is situated between Monastiraki and the Acropolis. The Agora is a captivating site that captures the essence of ancient Athens. As we strolled through the…

What if Socrates’ death sentence was justified? I’m sure you’re rolling your eyes. After all, he’s likely the greatest philosopher that ever lived and a method of teaching —named the Socratic Method out of reverence—bears his name.
Reverence is a good word to describe the current treatment for the man who possibly lived in 400 BC. Author Donald Robertson points out the presently popular Stoics used Socrates’ ideas as a building block. In fact, words written about him started Zeno of Citium down his path. Plus, Epictetus spoke admiringly about him as well.
The Oracle of Delphi even confirmed no one was wiser than Socrates. So, what could justify his punishment?
The philosopher’s curated story states he annoyed the Athenian establishment with his Socratic Method. In other words, he asked too many questions. Just think about your five-year-old nephew continuously asking “why” as you try to answer. Now, manifest that into a grown man’s frame.
Speaking of children, Socrates’ accusers also charged him with corrupting the youth of Athens. By “corrupting” most proclaim this means questioning their elders.

"The Riddle of C.L.R. James, Classical Athens, and American Civilization",https://medium.com/@questphd/the-riddle-of-c-l-r-james-classical-athens-and-american-civilization-619e439f5cce,"Sign up

Many are troubled or have difficulty understanding the meanings of CLR James’s meditations on Classical Athens and his study of American civilization. Far more important than whether antiquity and modern societies consistently embody profound philosophical values is what are our own democratic aspirations. This is the riddle at the intersection of James Athenian meditation within his book American Civilization.
Can Classical Athens be a measure for appraising America? Can the world of Aristotle, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Cleon, and Pericles illuminate the ethnically and culturally plural United States? How does nuclear power compare with a few thousand Greeks battling in the Peloponnesian Wars, or at Marathon, Platea, and Salamis in the Greco-Persian Wars? As the 1950s began, C.L.R. James, a Caribbean radical scholar, thought this comparative thinking central for clarifying freedom and popular self-government. Perhaps sublimated within the American constitutional struggle for happiness was the class struggle.
Between the Struggle for Happiness and the Class Struggle
CLR James (1901-1989) wrote on diverse topics: Haiti, Russia, France, Ghana, and Hungary. He also purposefully considered Shakespeare, Herman Melville, the Hegelian dialectic, Caribbean women of the barrack yard, and the sport of cricket. Placing Classical Athens in conversation with mid-twentieth century America, this experimental meditation challenges us. Can we think beyond boundaries? This is what James’s book American Civilization (1950) poses to the reader.
James was detained as an undesirable immigrant and a political prisoner at Ellis Island in 1952. His defense strategy, though he never found a fit public platform for it like Paul Robeson, was to explain the dilemmas of American democracy and civilization to the public and overcome official authorities.
Why Compare Athens and America?
James compared tropes of ancient Athens and modern America. He discussed questions of popular self-emancipation that are subordinated by rigid historical materialist views. Whether poor, powerless, alienated, or aware of a conquering force, most observers have a false idea of toiling people's creative potential. This is a result that dialogues about culture, civilization, and democracy generally, assume commoners have no part. Perhaps, their lives are permitted as cultural decoration for society.
A Trinidadian activist and illegal immigrant to the U.S., James believed these ancient and modern societies were valuable comparative referents to unpack this dilemma of freedom. This was so, even though the classical Athenian city-state was probably no larger than the size of the population of 1950s Vermont, one of America's smallest states. And the ancients' economy was probably no bigger than one modern department store.
Who compares a continent-wide modern country to an archipelago of islands in antiquity? Of course, a Caribbean man who admires Ancient Greece. But he was not juxtaposing a small place with an imperial center. James was evaluating world civilizations and clarifying the search for popular struggles within them.
Every Cook Can Govern and the Meaning of American Civilization
We must remember that James’s Every Cook Can Govern (1956) argued that the classical Athenian city-state was a direct democracy. That this could inform rebellious modern politics against elite representative governments, whether maintained by capitalists, communists, or trade union hierarchy. However, in American Civilization, the Athenian meaning was more obscure.
A hint is James’s Greece tells us something about the relations between working people, intellectuals, and artists. Further, it placed the ancient theatrical dramas of Aeschylus and Aristophanes in conversation with the modern popular culture of American films, comic strips, sports, and television. More than what academic literary critics thought, James’s mind was on what the audience or spectators did in response to popular cultural productions in antiquity. Further, what could they accomplish in the present and future?
First, we must understand that at least since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. has been in a permanent culture war around social identities. The perennial dispute is Anglo-America, that some wish to “make great again,” versus ethnically plural multi-cultural America. American conservatives claim that Greco-Roman heritage is foundational to Western civilization. On this basis, some say America is a civilization. They wish to place the U.S., after World War II, as taking over leadership of the world from Europe. This cultural approach arguably last had free reign in the early 1950s as James was writing shortly before the emergence of the Third World national liberation epoch.
Cultural Wars Around Social Identities
Today the U.S. is seen by most progressive scholars of American Studies as not a civilization but as a harvest of empire. A plurality of many ethnicities and cultures have gathered; American Exceptionalism is not the best means to account for this. Though the idea that progressives are against the empire of capital is most often a cruel joke. This is not irrelevant to understanding James’s American Civilization. For he points out correctly that modern business management theorists during World War II understood, far better than the Moscow-oriented communists, that workers wished to directly govern their industrial workplaces. And the historical evidence of the practices of both, two different hostile visions to popular self-government, prove James’s view accurate. This explains much about contemporary not merely early 1950s America. Still, this issue is what the link to the Ancient Greeks is all about; discovering the sublimation of everyday people’s potential.
James’s Athenian thought experiments for America go beyond the culture wars which is really a misnomer. The question is how will humans live on this planet; this is what the low-intensity, sometimes open conflicts have been about. What values will humans live by? It does not require ancient Greece or modern America to historically maintain a consistent set of values for this meditation to be useful. In fact, creative conflicts in societies can reveal not just chaos through possessive individualism but common futures. Observation of Hegelian contradictions is not about permanent sins or hypocrisy. Rather, the nuclei of the new society and their struggle to be born.
Beyond Culture Wars: American Civilization and Ancient Greeks
James’s American Civilization (1950), posthumously published in 1993, embodied this transition between the old world of looking at things and the new. But not fully as we might expect a famous Pan-African anti-colonial and independent socialist to do so.
James carried on the tradition of the French intellectual Tocqueville, and many other European thinkers who visited the U.S. from abroad. He was perhaps among the last to do his own comparative reflection on how America sustained, or not, the older foundations of Europe, which many assumed were philosophically Greek.
Placing the Athenian Legacy in Support of Popular Struggles
Most Americans, even university professors, cannot process intellectual thought that doesn't adhere to the patterns of the two main American electoral parties that overlord society together. James, counter-intuitively for many, was placing the Athenian legacy on the side of the workers, women, and Black freedom movements. After all, he was writing about civilization.
American civilization needed a coherent political and cultural philosophy. He was aware classical Athens subordinated women, slaves, and immigrants. James was trying to improve on the direct democratic sensibility for modern politics.
Civilization and National Cultures?
Contrary to Andrew Ross’s view, James was not writing about civilization or the prospects of socialism in one country. Instead, he was asking what was behind the cultural front built around Franklin Roosevelt produced by state planners, progressive intellectuals, and trade union hierarchy.
James was writing about a perceived civilization or national culture and incorporating dynamic tensions. It doesn’t matter whether we or James see America as a unified national culture or not. American concerns with disunity reveal this is how the vast majority see things, even where they dispute the American character and purpose.
The struggles for an ambiguous workers' democracy, and Black and women's liberation, he reconciled with the ideals of Greek antiquity that normally was wielded by modern Western elites. James did not strongly emphasize, in this publication, America as foundationally an empire based on African slavery and conquering the Indigenous, and for good reason.
Discarding Historical Trauma for a Renewal of Political Philosophy
The reception of James’s American Civilization is fumbled where it does not center James as an aspiring cultivator of the popular will. Moreover, where it does not illustrate that he is trying to clarify the political philosophy of ordinary Americans.
James was writing for a popular audience, who in the aftermath of World War II, did not easily grasp anti-imperialism. We must remember in real life he agitated against World War II as a clash of racists, imperialists, and authoritarians on both sides. This was something the Moscow-oriented communists did not do. For, like Stalinist Russia, they became allies of Franklin Roosevelt.
Before the Montgomery Bus Boycott: Thinking Beyond Equal Opportunity
This manuscript was an exercise in creative self-expression and not merely disciplined to a radical political movement. More significantly, those who pursue the death of the American nation culturally and intellectually (but not really, it's just an academic trope) fail to posit what should be America's political philosophical basis.
While in the early 1950s, the modern civil rights movement as embodied by the Montgomery Bus Boycott had not yet begun, we must remember something crucial. Equal opportunity to enter the rules of hierarchy has no democratic basis (direct majority rule) and has only renewed the American empire. It can only have a democratic basis for those who wish to diversify the hierarchies of a republic, which by definition doesn’t believe everyday people can govern.
This perennial failure, but intentional act for those who sell past traumas for present decadent collaborations, was far from what James was pursuing. The colonized man from the British empire sojourning within the American empire was trying something different. American Civilization was trying to discover popular self-management beyond voters for electoral politics, aware the vote had not yet been guaranteed to all.
Gathering Fragments Like an Archaeologist
James’s American Civilization is like many ancient Greek texts. Their discovery and publication, as archaeologists and historians comprehend, is a retrieval project of incomplete fragments that only partially indicate the world of their authors. James’s final draft may have clarified and foreshadowed the nature of the American empire. Similar to his Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways (1952), he might have shown the solution was the motley crew, the global toilers of Herman Melville’s whaling vessel, cooperating and aspiring to save the social ecology under arduous circumstances. The preface to James’s Melville book reminded this was one part of a larger study of the U.S.
However, American Civilization articulates a scenario, seemingly outdated from the moment it was written. What if John L. Lewis, the famous trade union leader of the mineworkers, became the next president after Harry Truman? This was an irritating projection for those who knew James was an advocate of workers' self-management, and Lewis was part of repressing such social instincts during the Age of the CIO labor movement (1933-1955). Still, many miss the ancient Greek content of James’s thought experiment.
Learning from Aristophanes's Sausage-Seller
James argued that if American intellectuals in the early 1950s could understand artistic creation, like Aristophanes in his play The Knights, ordinary people could be encouraged to subvert populist authoritarian leaders, such as Cleon in the era of the Peloponnesian War. The ""sausage-seller"" appears to do this in The Knights; James’s American Civilization uncharacteristically refers not simply to workers, farmers, and cooks but to sausage-sellers, a plebian identity from ancient Greece. Though many Americans eat hot dogs and sausages, ordinary toilers have a difficult time revolting against bureaucracy within their own freedom movements.
James proposed, not an affirmation of the authoritarian trade union leader or progressive politician; rather, an impending confrontation with them by the ""sausage-sellers."" That Lewis was a Republican, who both sided and clashed with Franklin Roosevelt, and who was a major trade union leader, complicates things nicely. If James’s readers were actually going to think for themselves. Many formally educated have had difficulty since the book was published posthumously. Why write about Greek antiquity or workers at all?
James explained that observers of American civilization, unlike European history (ancient and modern), do not understand that behind great personalities above society (in politics, sports, and entertainment) are the aspirations, the repressed strivings of social classes and groups. While James believed every ordinary toiler could govern society, there was a counter-vailing idea. Those individual personalities who express heroism and creative genius do not mirror the abilities of commoners. But this is a result that society is not arranged properly for everyday people to arrive on their own authority. Many like to live vicariously through great personalities above society. James, the cultivator of the popular will, was trying to draw them out of their shell below society.
The Social Motion Below the Great Personalities Above Society
James felt the classical city-state was approximating or approaching this possibility in a more primitive way before the emergence of modern politics. We must remember the totality of ancient Greece is invented by archaeologists. Classical Athens functioned substantially toward a future without a past.
Behind the statesmen (Cleisthenes, Solon, Cleon, and Pericles) were the emerging “proletarians of Piraeus.” Observing and judging the artistic productions of Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, was an audience of rank-and-file citizens. Importantly, not professional experts.
James underscored it was the popular audiences of theatrical productions that thousands of years later were manufactured as “high culture” by American and Western elites that decided what plays were the greatest. And so, the ordinary people of Athens had the capacity for independent judgment. And given the content of the award-winning plays, they clearly had the ability to make political judgments. Therefore, James is saying to his American audience that popular culture is high culture. And the latter is a fabrication unless it centers the judgment and capacities of everyday people. Western and American elites would be surprised to hear this.
Aeschylus’s Oresteia, Dick Tracy, and the Mafia in 1950s America
In the early 1950s U.S., people delighted in Dick Tracy comic strips and films depicting the Mafia. For James, these had something in common. Ordinary Americans were not satisfied with hierarchical government; they wished to live outside the state and its law. Though, of course, these were impositions. Tracy, a private detective, surprisingly had something in common with gangsters. They had guns, took matters into their own hands, and were not police.
American toilers wanted to be their own law-givers. While Plato searched for personalities to discipline the grassroots of the city-state, he felt it was a must, where Athenian commoners, even slaves, walked the streets like they were audacious peers of elitist citizens. It is debatable whether this is structurally true of ancient Athens. Rather, this was James’s Plato observing and fearing, through the trope of Socrates, the popular self-emancipating potential. This is our audacious Caribbean radical scholar's concern.
Vendettas, Patriarchy and Popular Courts
James loved Aeschylus’s Oresteia Trilogy. The meaning of its series of vendettas is disputed. Does it justify patriarchy or suggest a rebellion against it? Does it point to popular courts as the meaning of justice or the state as an argument for containing the Furies? Nevertheless, the audience decided these plays were award-winning. More crucially, as citizens, the audience had to decide, after the play the meaning of popular justice and their role in carrying it out.
James explained you can only relate to this if you have the sensibility of the ancient Greeks. Ordinary people’s actual social status in ancient Athens, or in modern America, was not decisive. Paramount was, how in culture and politics, commoners found means to think beyond their leaders and act on their own authority. What was revealed in Greek culture, sublimated in plays by Aeschylus or Aristophanes and their audiences, could also be seen in American popular culture. This told James something about mass audiences. Despite their surface psychology, they possess explosive potential.
The Odes of Pindar, Bureaucratic Politicians, and Business
James points to the poetry of Pindar implying it tells us about the commoners of ancient Greece and the U.S. What could he mean? He means a society that celebrates sports and competition, whether in the Olympic games or in modern baseball and football stadiums, where writing odes to the winners, confesses the true character of their nations. This cannot be embodied by politicians and businessmen. The barefoot and poor, with state sponsorship, little league uniforms, or playing in the street, express creative capacities in games that society is not organized for them to do so in politics. This can suggest a decline and fall for America or an emerging new beginning.
The comparative conversation about Athens and America does not move in straight and predictable patterns, especially for those who think like a voter for elite representative government. But even if the reader is starting to enjoy this meditation, how do we account for James’s celebration of Phidias and Praxiteles? What do ancient sculptors and architects say about the American proletariat? Further, James often did not make clear what the Peloponnesian War and Greco-Persian wars said about the potential of commoners in Greece and America.
What Can Be Accomplished in a Time of War?
Many scholars recognize that the Peloponnesian War (the battle between Athens and Sparta, which Sparta won) revealed an imperial tendency in Athens just as much as it embodies the search for federation. It is debatable what the meaning of the earlier Greco-Persian wars should mean for America. However, America, following World War II, was coming out of the experience of both foreign wars, and race, gender, and class struggles within.  James is saying great art and great heroism cannot fulfill themselves during war; society can only support them when it has put war behind them. Still, ordinary people’s instincts toward popular democracy, initially suppressed, can emerge in times of war as well. Even, if the rulers above society don’t wish this to happen. For James, the Athenian direct democracy presided over by Pericles between these ancient wars, was a new beginning where all citizens took part in popular councils and assemblies. There were no specialists and experts that dominated James’s Athens. Contrarily, this had been the vision of Franklin Roosevelt's planners and cultural apparatus.   The average Athenian citizen made decisions on economic planning, judicial affairs, and foreign relations, all matters the community faced. The Athenians knew everything was political, and art, science, and philosophy were integrated with politics and government, not in a dogmatic ideological way. But in the sense that, Greek citizens made the decisions directly that governed their lives. James was searching for a future America with these ideals and principles; certainly, the American conservative only pretended to do this for white men alone.
James did not believe Aristotle's politics should guide 1950s America. Though one should read him to understand politics and philosophy. Aristotle's Poetics interested James where the latter clarified what Athenian drama had been about when society was not menaced by war. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes were about purging their audiences of pity and terror. Where the masses had pity for heroes, and felt society was stalked by doom, they might emerge to take matters into their own hands after witnessing such theatre.  However, to relate to this proposition, we must reject tragedy as fate or some catastrophe beyond our control. When an actual play comes to an end, what is at issue for James’s Aristotle, is what will the audience do afterward. James’s American Civilization felt progressive cultural critics in the U.S. instead attached themselves to hierarchical regimes instead of the unfolding impulses to popular self-management.
American Labor: Wartime Strikes, Wildcat Strikes
We must remember that during World War II, most trade union leaders signed contracts with the bosses for a no-strike pledge for patriotic sustaining of war production. As Martin Glaberman has documented, then the rank-and-file, through their wildcat strikes, took greater initiatives than they had, even during the early CIO labor movement. We must remember that the first March on Washington Movement that strived to forge African American civil rights, despite its zig-zags, was a wartime strike.
Ordinary Americans’ apparent consciousness and psychology yesterday were no indication of their independent insurgent action tomorrow. James made clear in American Civilization that if workers followed John L. Lewis or Walter Reuther, the auto workers’ leader today, this was not an indication of what may happen tomorrow. Where leaders follow the instincts of everyday people below society (or not), it does not mean commoners cannot rupture with them.
What Do America’s Wartime Strikes Have to Do With Ancient Greece?
What do American wartime strikes have to do with Ancient Greece? The Greeks who took part in the Peloponnesian War and the Persian Wars had their own racial, imperial, and patriarchal impulses. They lived through times of crisis where they did not know exactly what they wanted. It is these same people, who forged the first aspiring direct democracy. Separate from ideals associated with ancient Athens is a reality: imperfect people with blind spots were the foundation of an impressive civilization. This is so cross-culturally, when considering any world civilization, the search for profound autonomy must be drawn out of barbaric circumstances.  James’s American Civilization aspired to show that the purported genius of American organization was not a penchant for national production or industriousness. Rather, the main currents of American character are the capacities for popular self-government among ordinary people. Intellectuals who cannot see this, James says, commit treason. Our capacity to grasp this has something to do with how we understand Classical Athens.
Re-Reading Classical Athens Beyond the Affirmative Action Empire
A proper understanding of James’s Greek antiquity studies is still emerging. And aspects of how he grasped the United States are still obscure. Can ancient Athens, or its spirit and ideals, be a model for America as a civilization, or a comparative reference for our understanding of American freedom and popular self-government? Do we inherently clash with contemporary dispositions in such pursuit? Where it forces us to move beyond making America “great again,” but also the affirmative action empire and the ethnically plural police state, James’s legacies deserve reconsideration.

The history of Athens is closely tied to the history of Greek democracy. It was in Athens that this form of political regime, which contributed to the city’s greatness and spread throughout the Greek world, developed. However, the early history of Athens remains obscure. It is known that there was a palace at the future city’s location during the Mycenaean period, surviving the destruction at the end of the second millennium. This allowed Athens to be a refuge for Greeks who settled in Ionia in the early 11th century. Little is known about the city’s history before the late 7th century. Aristotle, in the first part of the Constitution of Athens, reports that the original royal power was divided among three archons, later joined by six thesmothetes. Initially appointed for life, then elected for ten years, and finally annually, these archons governed with the assistance of a council of elders on the hill of Ares, known as the Areopagus. Two events marked the late 7th century: Cylon’s attempt to establish tyranny, thwarted by archon Megacles of the Alcmaeonid family, and Draco’s creation of a legal code regulating punishment for crimes of bloodshed. Aristotle also attributes a constitution to Draco, which modern critics consider a forgery from the late 5th century by those opposed to democracy.
With the beginning of the 6th century, and despite the numerous obscurities that remain, the…

I just arrived in Athens. My cab driver’s name was Christos.
His father was from Greek Macedonia, his mother from Crete. Men in Crete wear all black as a symbol of respect, he told me, “for the men who fought and lost their lives in the many wars, ‘fighting for our freedoms.’”
“Greece has so much history for such a little country.” “Look at you, you have such a big country and so little history.” (Ahem… I had been reading Thomas Jefferson’s biography on the plane.)
Christos had a construction company with over 25 employees before the Economic Crisis. As work started to dry up, he continued to pay his workers and had to lay them off gradually as the money ran out. He still has a company “on paper” but there has been no work for years. The company was started by his father who, he said, cries because he thought he had given his son a livelihood and now there is nothing.
I asked if he was against Greece being in the European Union. “No, I am not against Europe, I just want Europe to care about Greeks. Not Greece. Greeks.”
Cristos has three children so, he said, what was he to do? He spent money buying a taxi license. Two years ago, it cost him 100,000 euros (from 250,000 before the crisis.) Now the price has dropped again to 50,000 but Christos can’t recover the money he has already paid. He says that there is no work and even if there were, no one would hire him because he has several diplomas — he is too qualified.
He was rushing to finish up and get home before tonight’s World Cup soccer match started. Brazil-Colombia. I asked who he was for. “Brazil, of course.”
“You know they have the most expensive player in the world: Neymar?” (I did know.) “One hundred million euros. That is what they paid for a futbol player,” Christos said. “We — this humanity — we have to change. We have to change because we have children.”
As he pulled into the hotel, he apologized, “So much history. Such a much bigger conversation.”
But, sometimes the only way to start big conversations is with small ones — like a short chat with a stranger.

“The Parthenon Marbles are part of the Parthenon Temple, the most important work of ancient Greek architecture, considered the highest sculpture and artwork of its time. Of course, its importance doesn’t end there; what happened afterwards contributes to its story” said Zeynep Boz from the eastern side, bringing joy to the western coast of the Aegean.
Boz, a prehistoric archaeology graduate with art, law, and ethics degrees, represents Turkey as the Head of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. She previously served as a contact person for UNESCO with the UN Security Council. When she declared that there was no evidence supporting the claim that the Parthenon Marbles were taken to England legitimately during the Ottoman Empire, she became the person of the week in Greece, making Athens happy. But what is the story of the Parthenon Sculptures, which pit Greece against England? What does Turkey’s cultural support for Athens mean?
The bust of Nefertiti, extracted by German archaeologists from Egypt and brought to the Neues Museum in Berlin; the Rosetta Stone, discovered by a French soldier during a fortification excavation in Egypt and sent to the British Museum; the statue of Emperor Lucius Verus, returned to Turkey after being smuggled abroad in 1972… History, discovery, and plunder… All have been intertwined for centuries. The fate of the marble sculptures friezes, and architectural pieces taken from the Parthenon Temple in the Athenian Acropolis was no different.
Dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, these sculptures went from Athens, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to England in the early 19th century. It was claimed that the artefacts were taken with permission, thanks to a decree obtained by British diplomat Lord Elgin from the Ottomans. Support for returning this significant historical treasure, which has often caused diplomatic tension between Athens and London, came from Turkey on the other side of the Aegean. Zeynep Boz, the Turk who made Athens happy, answered questions.
Your speech about the Parthenon Sculptures at last month’s UNESCO meeting attracted attention. Is Turkey’s support for Greece’s efforts to retrieve the Parthenon Sculptures from England unexpected?
Frankly, Turkey’s support is not unexpected. The Parthenon Marbles is already a matter on which Greece is never alone. Turkey’s support is both sincere and deep-rooted and not new. It has continued uninterruptedly with a non-political approach. Likewise, Greece’s support for Turkey in combating cultural heritage smuggling is equally vital.
I think the reason behind making Athens so happy is your statement about a controversial document. For years, the United Kingdom has claimed an Ottoman decree granted permission for the artefacts to be taken to England.
Absolutely. The difference in this year’s session was Turkey coming forward and saying, “There is no such document.” England claimed that these artefacts were purchased legally from the Ottomans, according to Ottoman laws. As in Turkey, we had to respond. I needed to correct this. Otherwise, as a member of a country holding the Ottoman State archives, I would have accepted this claim.
We need a document showing that the Parthenon was legally acquired during the Ottoman period. There is only one translation mentioned in England. I need to see the original alongside it to call something a translation. So that there is a reference point. There is only something written in Italian on paper… No Ottoman seal, no sultan’s monogram…
So, it’s like a piece of note?
I wouldn’t want to say it like that, but in a way, yes. At least I can tell, “It has no official status.” I know Turkey’s stance had a significant impact.
It is perceived as if it changed something. However, over the years, I have seen the great sacrifices and efforts the Greek delegation has made.
What if England says, “Then let’s look at your archives”?
Many British researchers have already come to Turkey. Not just at the government level. Many academics have come to Turkey and conducted research in the state archives. The Ottoman State Archives are already open to the public. This is not something we are hiding. So, I say to England in response to this claim, “If we don’t have documentation, wouldn’t it be better not to make such a claim?”
You represent Turkey at the ministerial level. However, you are primarily a cultural person. You say, “You don’t discriminate based on religion, language, or race; we unite in the effort to reclaim our cultural heritage; friendship transcends borders.” Are the recent developments a concrete result of the détente policy in Turkey-Greece relations that began towards the end of last year? Or is it an ongoing cultural collaboration that is independent of this?
I support the second option. The first option also influenced the growth of the second. When relations between the two countries are better, when the winds of friendship blow, the manoeuvring areas of every nation naturally expand; this is a fact. But believe me, it would have been said earlier if this had happened. It was a very natural comment made by Turkey. It was related to the moment; it was not planned. As you know, Turkey’s Minister of Culture Mehmet Nuri Ersoy recently visited Greece and met with his counterpart there. Following these meetings, his Greek counterpart briefed him on the matter.
When the Minister returned to Turkey, he requested information from us. He said, “Let’s always continue this support; I want to be informed of all developments. This is a global issue where Turkey needs to show its stance.” These are not insignificant developments. However, on an expert level, Turkey and Greece have always supported each other in a non-political, technical manner.
Is the British Museum now obliged to return the Parthenon Sculptures?
We know how much the habits of collecting and collection practices have harmed cultural assets and how much they have fragmented and destroyed them. I wish the British Museum would return them… We are used to seeing moves related to England that will be turning points in human rights and many other areas, milestones in world history.
Of course, we would like to see one of these regarding the Parthenon. We would also like to see this with artefacts belonging to Turkey. So, is the British Museum obliged to return them? The obligation can be debated. But at least in an era where apologies are being made, I would very much like to see the British Museum return these artefacts to Greece.

Thousands of pieces of ostracon have been uncovered in Athens.
These ostraka are pieces of pottery that acted as voting tokens during an ostracism. In an ostracism vote, people (free men) would scratch the name of someone who they believed threatened democracy onto ostraka and if 6000 or more votes were cast, the person with the most votes was banished from Athens for a period of 10 years.
The men who voted in this decision were part of the Athenian Assembly (Ekklesia), which was made up of adult citizen men. These men made up a fairly small percentage of the 30,000–60,000 large population which was also made up of women, enslaved people and foreign-born residents.
Ostracism did not happen automatically, the assembly had to vote each year in favour of holding one and often they were not called. In the 71-year period that ostracisms took place (487 BCE — 416 BCE), only 13 individuals were ostracised.
If the vote was to be held, the actual ostracism poll would happen two months later. The voting process was called the ostracophoria, meaning ‘election to ostracise’.
The unlucky individual who ‘won’ the vote had 10 days to put their affairs in order before they had to leave with no* possibility of return before a decade was up. If one did try to reenter Athens during this time, they faced the possibility of the death penalty.
Despite these harsh terms, an ostracised individual was still allowed to keep any property they owned and could still be considered a citizen of Athens, which, as stated earlier, was a privilege which was not extended to everyone. Further, on return to Athens, it seemed that little changed for the outcast and they could return to politics with significant social status.
No politician was safe from ostracism and it was extremely common for a senior member of the state to have to take a 10-year ‘break’ from Athens due to the vote. One such example was Themistocles, a non-aristocratic politician and general of the 5th-6th centuries BCE who had succeeded in leading Greece to triumph over their enemy, Persia. At one point, Themistocles was one of the most famous and important politicians in Athens, meaning that he was a threat to democracy.
The pieces of ostracon above hold the names, top to bottom, of Pericles (politician and general), Cimon (politician and general), and Aristides (politician). Pericles is the man who put into motion the building program that created the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis. Aristides is one of the lucky banished men who actually got to return to Athens before his ten years were up. Aristides was ostracised in 482 BCE but was recalled to the city-state in 479 BCE to help Athens get ready for the upcoming war against Persia.
Although the purpose of the ostracism was to vote out somebody who became too powerful, it’s likely many people just voted for the person they liked the least. Some of the votes found in ancient rubbish dumps seem to have had a message of personal grievance. Some names had the added epithets of “traitor”, “slanderer” or “adulterer”. The politician Cimon, whose name can be seen on a piece of ostracon in the above picture, had his personal scandal alluded to by at least one angry voter. Smithsonian Magazine writes that one ostracon had the words “Kimon Miltiadou, take Elpinike and go!” etched onto it, Elpinike being the half-sister he was rumoured to have had an affair with.
For better or for worse, the last ostracism took place in Athens in 416 BCE.
Should we bring ostracism back? It seems like a much faster and more efficient way of non-violently removing people from authority, than the bureaucracy that keeps politicians in check today. I, for one, am a fan.

Imagine walking in the footsteps of the greatest thinkers of all time, witnessing their lively debates, learning from their wisdom, and participating in their democracy. This is what it was like to visit the Agora of Athens, the heart and soul of ancient Greece.
The Agora was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
In this article, we will take you on a virtual tour of the Agora of Athens, and show you how you can think like a Greek. We will explore the fascinating world of the philosophers, who challenged the status quo, questioned everything, and sought the truth. We will also discover the secrets of the citizens, who practiced direct democracy, exercised their rights and duties, and defended their freedom. And we will admire the beauty of the gods, who inspired awe, devotion, and art.
Are you ready to embark on this journey? Then let’s go to the Agora of Athens, and learn how to think like a Greek.
The Agora was the birthplace of Western philosophy, where Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle taught and debated. These three philosophers are known as the founders of the classical tradition of philosophy, and their ideas have influenced countless thinkers and fields of study throughout history. But who were they, and what did they teach?
Socrates was the oldest and most controversial of the three philosophers. He was born around 470 BC, and he spent most of his life in the Agora, engaging in conversations with anyone who would listen. He did not write anything himself, but his words and deeds were recorded by his followers, especially Plato.
Socrates was famous for his method of questioning everything and everyone, often annoying the authorities and the public. He believed that the only way to find the truth was to examine one’s own beliefs and assumptions, and to expose the contradictions and ignorance that lay beneath them. He once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
Socrates was interested in ethical and political questions, such as what is justice, what is virtue, and how should one live. He claimed that he did not know the answers, but that he was seeking them with the help of his interlocutors. He also claimed that he was guided by a divine voice, or a daimon, that warned him of what not to do.
Socrates’ relentless questioning and criticism of the established norms and values of his society earned him many enemies, especially among the powerful and the wealthy. He was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety, and he was brought to trial in 399 BC. He defended himself with eloquence and wit, but he refused to compromise his principles or to escape from prison. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
Socrates’ death was a tragic and heroic event that marked the end of an era, but also the beginning of a legacy. His followers, especially Plato, continued his mission of seeking the truth and questioning the conventional wisdom. Socrates became a symbol of courage, wisdom, and integrity, and his example inspired generations of philosophers and thinkers.
Plato was the most devoted and influential student of Socrates. He was born around 428 BC, and he came from a wealthy and noble family. He was interested in poetry and politics, but he abandoned these pursuits after meeting Socrates and becoming his disciple. He followed Socrates everywhere, and he recorded his dialogues and teachings in his writings.
Plato was the founder of the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He established the Academy in 387 BC, near the sacred grove of Academus, outside the walls of Athens. The Academy was a place where students and scholars could study and discuss various subjects, such as mathematics, astronomy, music, and philosophy. The Academy attracted many brilliant minds, such as Aristotle, Euclid, and Archimedes.
Plato was the author of many dialogues, which are considered the most important and influential works of philosophy. In his dialogues, he used the form of a conversation between Socrates and other characters, such as his friends, enemies, or famous figures. He used this form to explore various topics, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, morality, beauty, and justice. He also used this form to present his own views and arguments, often through the mouth of Socrates.
Plato was an idealist, who believed that there was a higher and perfect realm of ideas, or forms, that existed beyond the physical and changing world. He believed that the forms were the true essence and models of everything that exists, and that they could only be known by reason and intuition. He also believed that the forms were the source of goodness, beauty, and justice, and that the goal of human life was to achieve harmony and alignment with them. He once said, “Philosophy begins in wonder.”
Plato was also a visionary, who imagined the ideal state and the ideal ruler in his most famous dialogue, the Republic. In the Republic, he argued that the state should be governed by the philosopher-king, who had the knowledge and the virtue to rule wisely and justly. He also argued that the state should be divided into three classes, according to their natural abilities and roles: the guardians, who were the rulers and protectors; the auxiliaries, who were the soldiers and helpers; and the producers, who were the farmers and craftsmen. He also argued that the state should provide education, censorship, and eugenics, to ensure the harmony and stability of the society.
Plato’s ideas and writings have had a profound and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most original thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
Aristotle was the most brilliant and prolific student of Plato. He was born in 384 BC, in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He was the son of a physician, and he had a natural curiosity and interest in the natural world. He joined the Academy when he was 17 years old, and he stayed there for 20 years, until the death of Plato. He then left Athens and traveled to various places, such as Asia Minor, Lesbos, and Macedonia. He became the tutor of Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, who conquered most of the known world. He returned to Athens in 335 BC, and he founded his own school, the Lyceum, where he taught and wrote until his death in 322 BC.
Aristotle was the author of many works, which cover almost every field of knowledge, such as logic, ethics, politics, biology, physics, and metaphysics. He wrote in a systematic and analytical style, using observation, classification, and deduction. He was the first to develop a comprehensive and coherent system of philosophy, which aimed to explain the nature and causes of everything that exists.
Aristotle was an empiricist, who believed that knowledge was derived from experience and observation of the physical world. He rejected Plato’s theory of forms, and he argued that the essence and form of a thing were inseparable from its matter and substance. He also argued that the world was composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire, and that each element had a natural place and motion. He also argued that the world was governed by four causes: the material cause, which was the matter of a thing; the formal cause, which was the shape and structure of a thing; the efficient cause, which was the agent or force that produced a thing; and the final cause, which was the purpose or goal of a thing. He once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
Aristotle was also a practical and ethical thinker, who was interested in the best way of living and the best form of government. He wrote the Nicomachean Ethics, which is considered one of the most influential works of moral philosophy. In the Nicomachean Ethics, he argued that the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life was happiness, which he defined as the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. He also argued that there were two types of virtue: intellectual virtue, which was acquired by learning and reasoning; and moral virtue, which was acquired by habit and practice. He also argued that virtue was a mean between two extremes, or vices, and that it required practical wisdom and moral judgment.
Aristotle also wrote the Politics, which is considered one of the most influential works of political philosophy. In the Politics, he argued that the state was a natural and necessary institution, which arose from the human need for social and political association. He also argued that there were different types of states, according to their constitution and their aim. He classified the states into six categories, based on the number and the quality of the rulers: monarchy, aristocracy, and polity, which were the good forms; and tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy, which were the bad forms. He also argued that the best form of state was the polity, which was a mixed and balanced constitution, where the middle class had the power and the common good was the aim.
Aristotle’s ideas and writings have had a tremendous and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
The Agora was also the center of Athenian democracy, where citizens voted and served as jurors. Athens was the first city-state to adopt a system of direct democracy, where every male citizen had the right and the duty to participate in the government. The Agora was where they gathered to elect magistrates, pass laws, and decide on war and peace. The Agora was also where they held trials, where citizens acted as both judges and jurors. One of the most famous trials was that of Socrates, who was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
But what exactly was democracy? And how did it work in Athens?
The word democracy means “rule by the people” in ancient Greek. It was a radical and revolutionary idea, that challenged the traditional forms of government, such as monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. It was based on the principle of equality, that all citizens had the same rights and responsibilities, regardless of their wealth, status, or birth. It was also based on the principle of freedom, that all citizens had the liberty to express their opinions, to choose their leaders, and to hold them accountable.
Democracy in Athens was not the same as democracy today. It was a direct and participatory democracy, where citizens made decisions by themselves, without representatives or intermediaries. It was also an exclusive and limited democracy, where only adult male citizens had the right to vote, while women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. It was also a fragile and unstable democracy, where factions, conflicts, and coups threatened its survival.
Democracy in Athens was practiced mainly in two institutions: the Assembly and the Courts. The Assembly was the main legislative and executive body, where citizens met at least once a month, and sometimes more often, to discuss and vote on various issues, such as laws, decrees, taxes, treaties, and wars. The Assembly was open to all citizens, who could attend, speak, and vote. The Assembly was also the supreme authority, that could elect, appoint, or dismiss magistrates, such as generals, treasurers, or archons. The Assembly was also the sovereign body, that could revise, amend, or abolish the constitution, or the fundamental laws of the state.
The Courts were the main judicial body, where citizens served as judges and jurors. The Courts were divided into several types, according to the nature and the amount of the cases, such as civil, criminal, public, or private. The Courts were composed of a large number of citizens, who were selected by lot, or randomly, from a pool of volunteers. The Courts were independent and autonomous, that could not be influenced or controlled by the Assembly or the magistrates. The Courts were also powerful and decisive, that could impose penalties, such as fines, exile, or death.
Democracy in Athens was a remarkable and unprecedented experiment, that inspired and influenced many other states and civilizations. It was also a challenging and demanding system, that required the active and informed participation of the citizens. It was also a noble and admirable ideal, that sought to achieve the common good and the public interest.
The Agora was also the place where temples and altars were dedicated to various gods and goddesses. The ancient Greeks were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods, each with their own personality and domain. The Agora had shrines for Zeus, the king of the gods; Athena, the patron goddess of Athens; Apollo, the god of the sun and music; Ares, the god of war; and many others. The Agora was also where religious festivals and ceremonies were held, such as the Panathenaia, the most important festival in honor of Athena. The festival included athletic contests, musical competitions, sacrifices, and a procession that carried a new robe for the statue of Athena.
But who were these gods and goddesses? And how did they influence the life and culture of the ancient Greeks?
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the personifications of the natural forces and phenomena, such as the sky, the sea, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the fire, the thunder, the rain, and the seasons. They were also the patrons and protectors of various aspects of human life, such as love, war, wisdom, justice, beauty, agriculture, commerce, and art. They were also the ancestors and relatives of the heroes and the legends, such as Hercules, Perseus, and Jason.
The ancient Greeks had a complex and rich mythology, that explained the origin and the history of the world, the gods, and the humans. They believed that the world was created by Chaos, the primordial void, from which emerged the first gods, such as Gaia, the earth; Uranus, the sky; and Tartarus, the underworld. They also believed that the gods were involved in a series of conflicts and wars, such as the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians; and the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the Olympians. They also believed that the gods interacted and intervened in the affairs of the humans, sometimes helping, sometimes harming, and sometimes falling in love with them.
The ancient Greeks worshipped and honored the gods in various ways, such as building temples and altars, making sacrifices and offerings, performing rituals and ceremonies, and holding festivals and games. They also sought the favor and the guidance of the gods, by consulting oracles and diviners, by making vows and prayers, and by following omens and signs. They also feared and respected the gods, by obeying their laws and commands, by avoiding their wrath and punishment, and by accepting their fate and will.
The ancient Greeks also expressed their admiration and devotion to the gods through art and literature, such as sculpture, painting, pottery, poetry, and drama. They created magnificent and realistic statues of the gods, such as the statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They also depicted the gods and their stories on various objects, such as vases, coins, and jewelry. They also composed epic and lyrical poems about the gods and their deeds, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer, and the Theogony and the Works and Days by Hesiod. They also wrote and performed tragic and comic plays about the gods and their relations with the humans, such as the Oresteia by Aeschylus, the Oedipus Rex by Sophocles, and the Bacchae by Euripides.
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the sources of awe and art, that inspired and influenced the life and culture of the ancient Greeks. They were also the symbols and the expressions of the values and the ideals of the ancient Greeks, such as courage, wisdom, beauty, and justice. They were also the reflections and the projections of the hopes and the fears of the ancient Greeks, such as love, war, fate, and death.
The Agora of Athens was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens witnessed the rise and fall of the Athenian democracy, the glory and tragedy of the Greek civilization, and the birth and development of the Western thought. It was the place where Socrates questioned and challenged, where Plato dreamed and idealized, where Aristotle observed and analyzed, where citizens voted and debated, where gods were worshipped and honored, and where art and literature were created and celebrated.
The Agora of Athens is a place that still inspires us today, and that we can learn from and admire. It is a place that reminds us of the achievements and the challenges of the human spirit, of the values and the ideals of the human society, and of the hopes and the fears of the human condition.
If you ever have the chance to visit Athens, don’t miss the opportunity to see the Agora for yourself. You will feel like you are traveling back in time, and you will discover the roots of Western civilization. You will also feel like you are connecting with the ancient Greeks, and you will understand their worldview and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens is not just a historical site. It is a living and breathing museum, where you can see, touch, and feel the history, the culture, and the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. It is also a vibrant and lively square, where you can meet, talk, and interact with the modern Greeks, who are the descendants and the inheritors of the ancient Greeks.
The Agora of Athens is a place where you can think like a Greek, act like a Greek, and be like a Greek. It is a place where you can experience the past, the present, and the future of the Greek civilization. It is a place where you can find yourself, lose yourself, and rediscover yourself.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you will never forget, and that you will always remember. It is a place that will change you, and that you will change. It is a place that will challenge you, and that you will challenge. It is a place that will inspire you, and that you will inspire.
The Agora of Athens is a place that awaits you, and that you await. It is a place that welcomes you, and that you welcome. It is a place that invites you, and that you invite.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should visit, and that you will visit. It is a place that you should see, and that you will see. It is a place that you should know, and that you will know.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should love, and that you will love.

This artwork contains the presence of humans. There are many people gathering up against each other while doing what seems to be studying. Proven by the books they carried and read, these figures represent all of the greatest mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists that lived in that specific decade. Dozens of these geniuses all gathered around to discuss, sharing their ideas, expressing their opinions, and learning from each other. The architectural yet enormous building is mostly painted white. Some figures lay on the ground, reading and conversing. Some are upstairs gathering together, making a little crowd. The color palette was mostly vibrant, but washed out. Yet you can still see the soft contrast between the people’s clothes and backgrounds.
The artist used shapes such as cubes, rounded, and curved to create perspectives on the architectural building. At the front, we can see the building’s perspective from the curved line on the roof. But the overall structure of the building was probably cubed or a block. These different and neatly spread types of shapes made the artwork look more composed. The whole composition looked like it was moving. Because the artist made designs of people interacting with one another, they also made the color palette soft, so it radiates peacefulness. The central interest of this artwork is the two main characters that were painted in the middle of the commotion. It was obvious to spot them since the other individuals were all gathering around them. The artist succeeded in gaining my attention to the two by highlighting the middle of the painting. As you can see, the area where they stand is a bit lighter than the rest. Such little details make the biggest difference when it comes to painting.
The painting took place during the historical era of Plato. Let’s analyze the most distinctive element, which is the two people that were standing in the middle. Research claims that the two characters happen to be Plato and Aristotle. Plato was wearing red and purple. This color symbolizes the color of spirituality. A color that inspires reflection and self-awareness. While Aristotle was wearing blue with brown, which symbolizes the sky, sea, and earth, it also represents reliability and wisdom. These are the two main elements that the artist wanted to show through the main characters. The overall mood of the painting has a sign of coolness and warmth at the same time. The cool color tones that were used actually made the mood warm because the amount of commotion made the painting somewhat peaceful and relaxing to see. The landscape came off as natural, as the painting used a little bit of green for the building, so the piece itself was naturalistic. The object of the monument was already perfect because it holds and completes the inside of the painting, which is the people.
Paragraph one explains what is happening in the painting. We already knew they were discussing and trying to express their thoughts. This represents all of the different opinions and answers between people. The painting shows us geniuses. Mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. Yet they are gathering together, trying to find and gain answers. This shows that everyone can disagree with one another. They can have different thoughts and philosophies about one case. The artist is trying to say that even if we are concerned and confused about a single matter, humans will try to find a way to solve it. The main theme behind this piece is the high Renaissance. If I were inside The School of Athens, I would probably try to catch up on the topic that was being discussed, so I wouldn’t feel left out. The story behind this art is that it’s positioned facing Disputa and symbolizes philosophy, setting up a contrast between religious and lay beliefs. The painting is abstract because it looks at other non-objective artistic elements of shape, form, and color. The artist explored his ideas beyond the canvas and physical reality. I would explain this artwork as a painting where people gathered up all their ideas. As proven by the painting itself and the dozen people there.
Raphael had created a masterpiece and expressive drawing. The soft and cool tones he used added to the overall feeling of composure, calm, and relaxation. The unseen movement between the people makes me feel at ease just by looking at it. The faint green tones developed a sign of liveliness and nature. For me personally, this artwork does not need any improvements, as it is already perfect and has met the criteria for being the aesthetic theory of Renaissance art.

Initially, I was skeptical. In the age of Covid, do people even attend conferences anymore? With free educational content on YouTube and virtual conferences on Zoom, what’s the point? Despite my doubts, I found myself driving to Athens to participate in Devoxx 2023. Devoxx Greece is a three-day event where developer communities gather to discover the latest technological advancements, presented by some of the most inspiring speakers in the industry. The Devoxx family, which includes Belgium, France, UK, Poland, Marocco, and Ukraine, welcomes over 15,000 Devoxxians annually!
To my surprise, the conference was exceptionally well-organized, and the turnout was impressive. Four large rooms were filled with enthusiastic attendees, eager to absorb the knowledge shared in each session. The talks were organized into the following tracks: Architecture, Containers & Infrastructure, Data & AI, Development Practices, Java, UI & UX, Programming Languages, and Security. In this post, I will share my impressions and key takeaways from the talks I attended.
But first some pictures from the venue and the event.
Let’s see some of the main points for the talks that I had attended and enjoyed :-)
Ted aimed to bridge the gap between developers and managers in his well-prepared talk, which was filled with numerous real-life examples from his own experiences. The presentation focused on the key responsibilities of managers, such as assembling strong teams rather than just hiring star programmers, fostering an environment that helps developers achieve a state of flow, minimizing disruptions by reducing unnecessary meetings, and even making tough decisions like relocating or dismissing individuals who negatively impact team dynamics.
Natalie, a Community Ambassador for OpenAI, showcased the latest advancements in AI, specifically focusing on transformers. One notable takeaway from her presentation was the introduction of Phind, an impressive AI-powered search engine designed for developers. This innovative tool not only cites sources but also automatically generates follow-up questions, among other features.
Apache Kafka has become the go-to standard for high-performance data streaming applications. Such applications are rarely focused solely on message processing; they often need to integrate Kafka messages with remote endpoints, store messages in a datastore, or relay them to third-party services.
Ozan from Red Hat showcased how Quarkus, combined with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, can be used to build Kafka-based event-driven architectures. Quarkus is a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework designed for creating Java applications. Using a sample application, Ozan demonstrated the key concepts and common patterns, illustrating how Quarkus simplifies the development of event-driven microservices and integrates seamlessly with Quarkus’ reactive core.
What an incredible talk! Dan delved into a fascinating concept: leveraging the untapped potential of a company’s computers by running tasks in Chrome tabs. Each tab functions as an isolated environment and boasts a robust API. So, why not utilize the browsers within an organization to act as containers for running workloads, ultimately saving money on servers? I’m eager to get my hands on the source code he demonstrated!
Eliza from Amity showed how she can effectively create with the help of Generative models technical (code) and nontechnical presentations with a clear structure, slides with bullet points, images, and or even videos.
Jane introduced us to Qwik, a novel JavaScript framework that employs a unique rendering paradigm called “resumability.” This approach allows a JavaScript app to be serialized into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique commonly used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. Qwik enables the creation of “resumable apps” that require minimal JavaScript for interactivity and employ fine-grained lazy loading to load only the necessary components. Jane’s talk provided guidance on getting started with Qwik.
The key points covered in her presentation included: understanding the Qwik framework, comparing Qwik to React and Angular, strategies for reducing the size of JS bundles, and a tutorial on building with Qwik. The presentation piqued my interest, and I’m eager to give Qwik a try.
Dionysis, the Director of DevOps at GWI, showed us OPA: Open Policy Agent, which makes it possible to write policies that test the changes Terraform is about to make before it makes them. Also, he combined OPA with another open-source tool called infracost that calculates the cost of a terraform plan. This way he can also test and limit the cost of a terraform plan before actually applying it. Nice ideas for our DevOps!
Frank, a principal at Databricks, delivered a lively and engaging presentation on Data Lakehouse, a new platform from Databricks that blends the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. This innovative approach provides the reliability, robust governance, and performance associated with data warehouses, while also offering the openness, flexibility, and machine learning support characteristic of data lakes. Essentially, data is stored at the S3 level, but ACID transactions can be performed on top of it. An important takeaway from the presentation was that the term “real-time pipelines” may be somewhat misleading, as there is always a slight latency. Additionally, Frank introduced the appealing concept of continuously ingesting all data and replacing traditional ELT pipelines with streaming pipelines — truly cutting-edge ideas!
Emilia, a software engineer specializing in mobile gaming technologies, shared insights from psychology and cognitive sciences to illustrate how their application can lead to more effective user experiences, both positively and negatively.
Key topics covered in her presentation included dual process theory, heuristics, the illusory truth effect, the paradox of choice, priming, and inadvertent priming, among others.
(Note to myself from the talk: The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over other from William James)
In his presentation, Mohammed, an avid Formula 1 enthusiast, explored how we can make our code deployments as secure as Formula 1 races. Drawing from various principles employed in F1, he demonstrated how we can learn from and adopt these concepts in the way we design, structure, deliver, and safeguard our systems.
The talk covered:
+ Importance of having a trusted and adversarial CI/CD pipeline
+ Security patterns: Least privileged principal, defence in depth, Zero trust
+ Resiliency patterns: Micro-segmentation, Anti-overload patterns
+ Monitoring and alerting
In Cassandra’s presentation, she offered a wealth of both theoretical and practical guidance on leveraging social media, podcasting, and YouTube to establish a meaningful personal brand that not only benefits one’s career but also contributes to the community. These platforms have evolved from simply being enjoyable ways to share our lives and connect with others to becoming essential tools for networking and career advancement. During the talk, attendees heard about individuals whose personal brands played a key role in their success as esteemed developers, managers, and community leaders. Participants learned how to utilize their online presence for career growth and received valuable insights on best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for striking a balance between professional and personal content.
In this presentation, Chris discusses the approach they devised for executing chaos engineering scenarios. The aim was to conduct exercises for new team members, acquainting them with alarms and the complete incident response procedure to ensure their preparedness for real situations. He demonstrated the rationale behind conducting such experiments, the design process, implementation, and ultimately, the evaluation and application of the solution.
This is a brief summary of some of the talks I attended. I’d like to thank the Devoxx team for organizing such a professionally-run conference. The audience was genuinely enthusiastic, and many valuable and meaningful conversations and connections took place. Be sure to visit Devoxx’s official website or Facebook page. I’ll attempt to share my impressions of the remaining talks in a future post.

What is Western Civilization and where did it come from?
This is the question I have been seeking answers to which has guided much of my reading. Today, those answers are coming from Jacob Howland’s book, Plato and the Talmud.
I first heard of the idea that Western Civilization is a combination of Athens and Jerusalem from Ben Shapiro in his book The Right Side of History. It made some sense to me then but the more I dig, the more sense it makes. There is a resistance for some people to understand and even admit that much of our culture is Biblically derived, but I don’t see any way around it.
At this point, I don’t think anyone can understand Western Civilization without an understanding of the Bible in the same way that we would expect them to understand Greek philosophy. And when someone tries to convince me otherwise, I take it as evidence that they don’t understand our civilization and will not until they get over that hump.
What Howland is doing in this book is comparing those two distinct lines of thought and describing their similarities and their differences.
One major difference which I have suspected is a key ingredient in the Bible missing from…

Before you start reading, I bet you’re wondering what exactly is a Perrucha: it is not any type of dog, or parrot (as in French), it is simply a term of endearment for those who feel independent, like to explore, to discover (and discover themselves), or what Charli XCX called a Brat. It means someone who is open minded and likes to have fun, and to mix with real people. If you’d like to visit only fancy places, there are other guides for you. When I visit a city, in Perrucha mode, I like to let the city tell a story, of the good and the bad sides, everything that makes it what it is.
As for Athens, you will se it has graffiti, the Acropolis, beautiful museums, sandy beaches, a vibrant music scene, an anarchist neighborhood, and one of the most welcoming people I have ever met. And just wait till you taste the food!
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home. Coming from a Latin American city, I believe it was the mix of beauty and chaos which won me over. Ever since, I’ve felt the need to return and keep exploring. I hope this guide will give you some tips that go beyond the main touristic areas and things to do, the same way I like to share my recommendations with my friends (this way I can also get them to read what I write).
If you are an international traveler, you will probably get to Athens by air -to the international airport Eleftherios Venizelos, commonly initialised as AIA-, or by sea -to Piraeus Port. If you get to the Port, you can easily take Line 3 to the city center, to the airport, or just get a taxi.
Going to the city center from the airport has quickly improved in the past 10 years, now you can just take the line 3 of the metro directly — approximated cost is 9€ per person. A trip to the city center (Syntagma Square), will take approximately 40 minutes. Uber is connected to the Taxi services, which you can also take to and from the airport.
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home…
You can order taxis via Uber and Freenow (only official taxis exist and use the meter), or take the metro/buses (as the metro won’t take you everywhere). The metro is quite clean and useful to get to and from the international airport.
In the Greek capital, I would say most of the people speak English, and all over Greece the road signs are in both Greek and English, I imagine because Greek is not so popular outside Greece. However, once you move to more retired places, having Google translate (or other apps) comes in handy, even if the younger generations speak English, you may find yourself ordering random items on the menu. In any case, people will most of the times be ready to help you, even if they don’t speak your language.
In short, with a metro card, basic English, and a positive attitude, you can easily move around.
You have two main areas you can choose from: enjoy the historical city center, or stay somewhere closer to the beach.
If you prefer the historical city center, you can try areas such as Plaka and Koukaki, which are walking distance to the Acropolis and full of restaurants and bars. You also have easy access to the metro. This areas are mainly touristic, especially Plaka; I personally prefer Koukaki for its chill vibes and it still walking distance to famous monuments like the Acropolis.
I would avoid areas such as Omonia and Monistiraki, even though they might offer cheaper options, they’re very busy and not as charming as other areas. The same goes for Pireas Port area, it’s not a place to hang out, unless you want to photograph ferries.
On a whole other vibe there is Exarcheia, the anarchist neighborhood. The neighborhood features a maze of architectural styles, bohemian shops, second-hand stores, record shops, and bookstores. Also amazing bars and restaurants for really good prices.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area. Since there is no metro to go there (there might be in the future), the closer you stay to the beach, the cheaper the taxi (duh). If you go further South, you can even visit Vouliagmeni Lake, also worth seeing.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area.
There is also an option in between the historical city center and the beaches: Paleo Firios, which is walking distance from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, an iconic building housing a library, an opera, a rooftop, and it’s a more residential neighborhood.
First and foremost, in Plaka neighborhood, go all the way up to the Acropolis. In front, instead of paying to enter the museum, which is empty (you can see the pieces in the British or Louvre Museums), just go to the museum restaurant and take pictures from there.
On Sundays see the change of guard in Syntagma Square.
Walk around Monastiraki square. See Filopapo’s hill (Socrates Prison) for the view (Colina Filopappou). If you have extra time you can go up the Mount Likavittos up the hill’s transport.
Walk around Exarcheia (the anarchist neighborhood) and discover the restaurants and cafés in a unique setting.
See Renzo Piano’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation if you can (on your way to Pireas port). The sunset from the rooftop bar is breathtaking. From June to August, you can also enjoy a free Open Air Cinema at night.
I insist for the beach lovers: make sure to check out the Vouliagmeni area, there’s even a Lake with a fancy spa. Most people skip the beaches in Athens, but to me they’re worth the visit, plus, the prices are quite affordable, even for the beach clubs.
There’s the small area of Mikrolimano next to the port with nice restaurants and a gorgeous view.
You can take a day trip to see the Delphos Oracle.
You can buy cosmetic products made with olive oil and honey. Just for the fun, go check out Greek pharmacies, they have the best natural cosmetics, a perfect souvenir.
For sports fans: you can visit the city’s multiple stadiums, be that the Olympic Complex built by renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Olympiacos F.C. Stadium near Pireaus, or the AEK Athens F.C. Agia Sophia Stadium in Nea Filadelfia. The locals I talked to are fervent fans of the AEK Athens F.C. and love the atmosphere.
A plus: a 40-minute drive from Athens, you can visit the APIVITA Cosmetics factory. If you’re my friend, you know I wish they would sponsor me since I use all of their products: they’re made of honey or olive oil. The factory visit is free of charge and you can buy their products at factory prices (located at Markopoulo Mesogaias).
Greece has rich culinary traditions and excellent quality ingredients, so it is not too hard to find good food, coffee and wine wherever you go. In my experience, Athens is one of the best cities in the world for cocktails, the attention to detail and creativity is impressive (also for the prices).
My personal favorites are the following:
· Fried cheese in all forms (cheese beignets, cheese pie)- the cheese can be Feta or Saganaki.
· Eel, squid and fish.
· Eggplant salad (spread).
· Greek salad Saganaki gambas (or anything in Saganaki -red- sauce).
· Mezze: small plates to share.
· Souvlaki (meat on a stick).
· Greek Yogurt with fruits, nuts and honey.
· Iced coffee: Greeks take iced coffee very seriously (as anyone should), hence you will have some of the best iced coffee, no matter the way you order it.
· Alcohol: most beers are pils, for darker beers try micro breweries (mostly in Athens).
· Grape liquors: Ouzo, Raki/Tsipouro — with or without Anis, Masticha, Wines.
Greece is a great place to be a vegetarian or vegan, as they have the well-known Mediterranean diet with fresh cheese, tomatoes, olives, cucumber and olive oil.
· Mpakaliarákia (Greek food) — Kidathineon 41
· Lolos — Geor. Olimpiou 5
· Mikrolimano area (Greek food) — 16, Akti Koumoundourou 24
· Try fried feta cheese with honey, moussaka (like lasagna), souvlaki (meat on a stick). Honestly everything is delicious.
· Drink Raki, Ouzo, Tsipouro (with or without anis), Rakómelo and Mastiha.
· six d.o.g.s — Avramiotou 6–8
· Neratzia Café Bistró (great wine bar) — Zan Moreas 6
· Tranzistor — Protogenous 10
· Baba au rum — Klitiou 6
· Rosalia — Valtetsiou 59
· Bolivar Beach Club — Leof. Poseidonos, Alimos 174 55
· Attic Urban Rooftop — Ermou 86
· Migniardise — Veikou 30
· Plaka is great for shopping for souvenirs such as clothes, magnets, food and cosmetics.
· Syd Records — Protogenous 13
· Athens Tattoo Studio — my favorite artist there is @boss_667ttt
· The prices are competitive, so look for the one closest to you and try it out.
Disclosure: make sure to check the listed places on Google Maps to see if they’re still running.
If you have anything you think I missed, feel free to share in the comments.
Having seen Athens, you can take a ferry and continue your trip to the islands, or take a train or car and see the inner part of the country.

Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP) is the largest water utility in Greece providing services to 4.3 million customers. Read how EYDAP is reducing water-energy nexus pressures.
By Robert C. Brears*
EYDAP has launched an ambitious program of renewable energy utilization with the objective of contributing to the optimization of the energy balance across the country and society and exploring the possibility of expanding to new profitable business. The water utility’s involvement in energy can be grouped into the areas of hydropower, cogeneration of heat and power, solar energy, and energy reduction initiatives.
Hydropower
Along the aqueduct system that brings raw water into the Athens area for treatment there are existing energy dissipation works (small waterfalls along the aqueduct). EYDAP is in process of converting these energy dissipation works into energy production plants, therefore taking advantage of the aqueducts’ hydropower potential. These energy production plants consist of temporarily redirected water flowing through a turbine that converts the hydraulic energy potential into electricity by use of a generator. The water then rejoins the aqueduct at a lower elevation and continues its flow to the water treatment plant. To date, EYDAP has constructed six small hydropower plants along its aqueducts located in Kirfi (760 kW), Elikona (650 kW), Kartala Kihairona (1,200 kW), Mandra (630 kW), Evinos Dam (820 kW), and Klidi (590 kW).
Cogeneration
At Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant, which receives 730,000 m³ of wastewater per day, biogas is captured to produce electricity and thermal energy at the Psyttalia heat and power cogeneration plants, with total wattage being 11.4 MWe and a thermal force of 17.3 MWth.
Solar energy
EYDAP has already licensed production for a photovoltaic power station that generates 1,971 MW on its premises of Aharnes. The contract will enable the selling of electricity to the Hellenic Electricity Officer. In addition, EYDAP is exploring the possibility of constructing smaller photovoltaic plants at other company locations.
Energy conservation
EYDAP has designed an intensive program of energy saving in buildings and facilities including energy inspections and energy saving advice. The utility is also undertaking preventative maintenance to achieve the best possible maintenance and extension of lifetime energy-intensive plant equipment to save energy. The overall aim of EYDAP is to save energy by maximizing the management of existing building equipment without making additional investments with excessive costs.
Multiple benefits
By developing renewable energy systems and undertaking energy conservation measures EYDAP is realizing multiple benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, additional income from trading carbon rights or green certificates, and new employment opportunities.
The take-out
By embracing renewable energy and energy conservation, water utilities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills, all the while offering employment opportunities.

The Greeks planted colonies widely, from Istanbul to Marseilles to Alexandria. And scattered all over the Mediterranean you will find remains of Greek temples (Wikipedia’s (incomplete) list notes 43 of them; it would be a good project for people to add to that list). But which — whether due to their preservation, or their setting, or their architectural value — are the best to visit? We’ve criss-crossed the Mediterranean in pursuit of the best, and we’re happy to share our list with you.
Overshadowed by the more spectacular Acropolis in Athens, the Hephaestion is under-appreciated. One of the very best preserved of all Greek temples (look at that ceiling!), it’s a must-see for any visitor to Athens. Set in a pleasant if slightly bland park — it’s easy to feel disconnected from the urban fabric of Athens here — it’s not difficult to find a shady place to watch the play of light on the temple’s myriad carved surfaces. Long known as the Theseum and a favorite of 19th century artists, it’s a must-see for lovers of ancient architecture.
In school you hear about Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns, but almost all the best-preserved Greek temples are Doric. At Didyma (Didim, in southwest Turkey) you’ll get your best opportunity to appreciate the Ionic: the Temple of Apollo Didymaios. Be prepared to be impressed: the temple’s platform is almost 400 feet long, and supported an incredible forest of 116 columns each more than six feet in diameter and 60 feet high. Admiring what is left, you begin to grasp the first reason why we have so little of the Ionic: these temples were lofty, ambitious structures. Sixty-foot columns don’t typically stand earthquakes, and when they fall, they shatter. But the Ionic style isn’t only to be admired for its size. These are some of the most elegant, beautiful ruins you will ever see: giant Medusa-heads watch over the ruins, exquisite reliefs ring the column bases, and everything is made of a gleaming marble whose beauty you have to see to believe. The vast temple enclosed an open-air court, where were kept a spring and laurel sacred to Apollo. Bring your Herodotus with you: the sanctuary — generally referred to as “Branchidae” by Herodotus, for the family that maintained the temple — was a key player in the Ionian Revolt, and Father of History recounts all the steps that led to its destruction in 494 B.C.
Delphi, easily reached from Athens, is one of the most touristed places in Greece. But it’ll take a lot more visitors to ruin this incredible mountain sanctuary. Tucked away in a valley the Greeks thought resembled a uterus (delphus), it’s still one of the most spectacular religious sites in the world. The views alone are worth the trip. And while the actual structure of the temple probably won’t overwhelm you, the significance of the place, and the weight of so much emotional human history — for centuries, people came here in the thousands literally looking for answers — still can be felt today. The famed objects are almost all gone — the wooden staff offered by Brutus, Rome’s first consul, or the rich gifts left by Croesus — but reading Pausanias’s account of them all will serve to remind you that this little mountain village was in many ways the spiritual center of the ancient world.
If you think Delphi’s mountain scenery is spectacular, wait til you try a visit to Bassae, a truly remote Greek temple atop a mountain literally in the middle of Arcadia. Most of the year you’ll probably have the place pretty much to yourself, too — if you can get there (it’s accessible only by car or by an expensive taxi). It may be the best-preserved Greek temple in the world, and as such has been the subject of much academic study (and the first to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Supposedly designed by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon, this temple’s beauty and harmony were singled out for praise by Pausanias almost two thousand years ago. And just to see those columns, still standing on that summit after all these centuries, is enough to give the pious traveller chills. The interior frieze was carted off to the British Museum in 1814, where you can still admire it (Mary Beard and John Henderson made the frieze the starting-point for their 2000 volume, Classics: A Very Short Introduction, a suitable companion for your journey in Arcadia).
This site might well have taken the top spot on our list were it not for the fact that in 1987 an enterprising preservationist decided the temple needed to be protected, and that the right way to protect it was to put it beneath a gargantuan latex tent. As you drive up the winding road it appears that the mountain is now crowned not by an extraordinary ancient temple but something rather like a Cyclops’ discarded condom. The temporary structure — which is remarkable-looking on the inside, I will confess — has now been there for almost thirty years. To make matters worse, at times the “preservation works” inside take up all the area inside the tent, and visitors are allowed to visit only the front face of the temple. What was once perhaps the most spectacular place in all Greece is now at times almost completely off limits. Not only that, but the tent has spawned a whole brood of conspiracy theories (“what exactly are they hiding up there? ALIENS?”). But a trip up to this three-thousand-foot-high ridge is to see just how spectacular the Greek architectural imagination could be.
The mountains of Greece are remarkable, but when you think of Greece, you think first and foremost of the sea. The most glorious religious manifestation of this is the temple of Poseidon at Sounion. On a sea-girt promontory jutting into the Aegean, almost every ship bound for Athens came within sight of this clifftop shrine. The structure is decidedly ruinous, but the spectacular setting is forever memorable (as is the signature from Byron carved into one of the pillars). The site history is not complex here — there has been the temple and the sea and the rock and not much else. On summer evenings a crowd gathers at the temple to watch the sunset, with a pleasant holiday vibe. It’s touristy, but the spot is still appreciably wild: I’ve hiked all over the promontory and even camped out there to get a little time alone with the beach.
Cumae is the place where Daedalus landed (without Icarus) after flying away from the Labyrinth, and his wings were supposedly kept in the temple of Apollo there. There’s not much left of the temple today — just the foundations — but the location on an abandoned hillside in Italy overlooking the Mediterranean is second to none. It’s the setting of Book Six of the Aeneid too, and reading Vergil’s lines on-location at the temple will give you shivers. Factor in the remarkable cave structure there, the Roman roads climbing the acropolis, and the temples of Zeus and Artemis nearby, and this is one of the best archaeological sites in the whole Mediterranean. It’s undiscovered too — the crowds all head to Pompeii and Naples just to the south.
Selinunte is one of a trio of top-notch Greek temple sites in Sicily (the other two are Segesta and Agrigento), all of which make our list. On a high plain overlooking the sea and flanked by golden beaches, it’s pretty easy to have a good time at Selinunte: mornings with the temples, afternoons at the beach, and evenings at the clubs. Not only that, but Selinunte boasts five major temple structures and several minor ones sprawling over the largest archaeological park in Italy. “Temple E” (generally presumed to be a temple of Hera) makes for the best pictures — it was re-erected using the original stones — but the whole site is interesting, especially if you can get there before temperatures start to soar.
Once the home of the great warrior Ajax, Aegina, just across the Saronic Gulf from Athens, doesn’t get the love that the more distant Greek islands get, but this temple of the mysterious “disappeared” Earth goddess Aphaia (aphaia means “not appearing”) is something special. It sits atop a hill overlooking the sea, on a quiet part of the island far away from the crowds. The temples of the Acropolis and Sounion are actually visible from here, and there may have been some kind of communication in antiquity from temple to temple with watchfires. The panorama is all big sky, old stone, and blue sea, an essence of Greece refined up through twenty-five hundred years. The temple itself is Doric, from around 500 B.C., and the sculptures from its pediment — now in Munich — stand, like the temple itself, right in that happy borderland between the Archaic Greek period and the full Classical style.
Strolling through the flowery hillsides, you might find it hard to imagine that Segesta once was a city. Almost nothing of the place remains, a fact which makes its two principal ruins all the more striking: an impressively preserved stone theater and an even more perfectly preserved Doric temple. You start by the temple, its unfluted columns aging to the color of sand and ochre; the Sicilian sun marks time’s every stroke upon the stone with a casting of shadow; landscaped grounds display the sun-loving Sicilian vegetation. A half-mile walk up the hill brings you to the theater, cunningly built as most of them are, splendidly preserved and following the line of the hill. Turning back to see the temple set among fields, with the waters of the Mediterranean in the distance and even further beyond, the endless hills of Sicily, you get one of the world’s most picturesque views. Thomas Cole selected precisely this view to produce one of his best Grand Tour keepsake paintings. Past and present seem to join hands here. Even today the temple looks almost brand-new, as if a team of builders threw it up in the past month and have just gone home for the day before coming back tomorrow to put on the roof and give it a final paintjob.
We know, we know, we know: the crowds can be awful, the sun is so glaring your eyes start watering without sunglasses, it’s beastly hot in summer, and parts of the place get roped off for no apparent reason. But it’s the Parthenon, and there’s a reason the crowds keep showing up. The most iconic image of Ancient Greece, the temple of Athena Parthenos is still a standout among Greek temples, for its incredible position at the center of Greece’s greatest city, for the Doric proportions perfectly poised between airy elegance and stony heft, for the gorgeous Pentelic marble that seems to mirror the color of the sun in the sky — pink at sunrise, blinding white at midday, honey-colored in the afternoon — and because it’s the Parthenon. This is the chief monument of “the school of Hellas,” the tangible remainder of Periclean Athens. It’s hard not to be impressed when you’re there. And there’s the rest of the Acropolis to see too — from the Erechtheum on top to the theater of Dionysus below (yes, that theater). There’s a reason why this is all a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’re better off going off-season, but no one who loves Greek temples is going to want to miss this one.
The Italians have chutzpah, and at times it pays off. The temples at Paestum, just south of the Amalfi Coast, face onto a road. There are businesses along the road: a few hotels, a few restaurants, a few bars. This could be a disaster. But it’s not: it’s delightful, and it makes visiting Paestum a real pleasure. The last time I was there I visited a bar where couples and friends were lined up at tables just staring at the sun setting over the Temple of Athena. It seemed like some kind of perfect dream of Mediterranean life. And it’s Italy: the restaurants are fabulous (they’re famous for their mozzarella di bufala), the bars are fabulous. There’s even a hair salon with a temple view. And the temples themselves? They are perfect. Their names have changed over generations, but the one now known as the Temple of Poseidon is one of the standout works of antiquity. The etching Piranesi completed of it — perfectly capturing the mystery of all things old — is perhaps the master’s greatest work. That Paestum comprises multiple temples, that they are so accessible, that there are perfect vantage points from which to draw or contemplate them, that the beach is so close, that the walls of the city form another remarkable attraction reachable by short walks through the fields, that they are visited but not overcrowded, that the place is easily accessed from the train — all these things make a visit to Paestum one of the very best ways to experience Greek temple architecture.
Grand as all the temple sites of Magna Grecia are — Paestum, Segesta, and Selinunte are all on this list — the grandest of them all is Agrigento, the ancient Akragas, where a walk through a grove of almond and olive leads you from magnificent Greek temple to magnificent Greek temple, all of them perched on an impossibly photogenic ridge. The site is hot in summer but truly beautiful all throughout the year, thanks to the warm climate, sea views, and some gorgeous Mediterranean landscaping. The bloom of the almond trees in February is particularly stunning, and the wonderful spread of the site makes it a perfect botanical garden — it’s almost as if the ancients spaced out their temples to cater to the tourist experience.
The so-called Temple of Concordia is the star attraction, a splendidly preserved Doric temple in a warm buff stone, but the site boasts seven temples, all of which are worth visiting, and much besides: the remains of an “Atlas,” part of the temple of Zeus, shows its utterly unique temple design. Alone of all the Greek sites in Italy, the Valley of the Temples has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status. The adjacent town of Agrigento is a kind of miniature Sicily in itself, with ancient, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and modern buildings in a kind of glorious jumble. Olives, sunshine, sculpture, blossom, wine-dark sea, history laid upon history: if you want to get the experience of an ancient Greek temple, it’s pretty hard to beat Agrigento.
You don’t have to choose just one, of course. The best is to find a way to see them all. Have a favorite we left off our list? Feel free to add it in the comments.

(TW: Sexual Assault. Please read with care. Thank you.)
There were none wiser, stronger, or better than her, Athena, the Goddess of wisdom and strength, knew. Victory flowed fresh in her blood of gold — ichor. She had just won the battle of being the patron God of Athens and won from whom but her uncle, the God of the Waters himself! However, she knew Poseidon’s propensity to hold grudges. An attack could be on the way anytime soon. The caution did not stop her from savoring her spoils as her hungry eyes wandered over the capital, looking for a new conquest to engage her. Mortals could be the most entertaining species. Amidst the cacophony of the cosmopolitan city — hawkers crying, officials announcing, and buyers haggling, a mellifluous voice struck her ears.
“Goddess Athena!”
Few things managed to take Athena aback. The woman’s beauty happened to be one of them. Long, golden hair tumbled on her dusky face, which was adorned with a dainty nose and full, red lips. Her white robe contrasted against her skin. The woman was kneeling in the exquisitely built temple of marble, which had been devoted to the Goddess. The mortal continued to heap praises. Well aware of the protocol, the golden-haired maiden stood and draped an embroidered silver robe on Athena’s statue. Divine rays emanated from the statue as Athena deigned to appear in the temple.
“Goddess!” the woman gasped, falling on her knees.
“Rise, maiden.” Athena’s rich, deep voice reverberated in the temple. “What is your name, and whence do you come from?”
“Medusa is my name,” the mortal’s silky voice said. “I am the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto, minor lords of the sea.”
Athena’s eyes hardened. “Lords of the sea, you say?”
“The sea, Goddess. But I am here to devote my heart and soul to your service. I want to be the first priestess of this temple.”
Medusa looked into Athena’s eyes. A sudden current passed in the space between them. The mortal must have felt the exchange of sparks too, for she looked away, red rushing to her cheeks. Athena noticed the blueness of those frail mortal eyes — eyes that were bluer than the sky and deeper than the ocean. Yet, another factor attracted her. Those eyes seemed to contain intelligence and consideration more than most men.
“Answer me, then. What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?”
Medusa did not take time to think. “The answer should be a human. In the morning of life — our childhood — we crawl on all fours. At noon, which is adulthood, we walk upright on two legs. In the evening of our lives, we use a cane as a third leg.”
“Born of the earth, yet a gift divine,I thrive where the sun and soil align.A token of peace, a feast I provide,In oil or fruit, I’m prized worldwide.What am I?”
Medusa smiled in recognition. “Your gift to us, Goddess, what else? The people of Athens chose this over Poseidon’s salt water. They are your divinely provided olives.”
Athena continued to grill the woman — on policy, on Gods, on anthropology. Each answer seemed better than the previous and drew Athena closer, till she could hear the mortal’s breaths. Athena knew her presence overwhelmed mortals, yet the maiden held her ground.
“Last question for today,” Athena said.
“I cannot be seen, yet I color your view,I cannot be touched, yet I’m felt through and through.I can bind the mighty, or make the meek bold,A treasure eternal, yet never bought or sold.What am I?”
Athena watched Medusa’s lips as she spoke. “The answer is love, Goddess. The best and the worst feeling in the world.”
A rush of power hit Athena; a unique exhilaration and euphoria made their way to her heart. She could appreciate beauty with brains; she could appreciate a challenge. Medusa remained on her knees, awaiting the judgment.
“Call an official,” said Athena. “I have an important announcement to make.”
And so, one of Athena’s first and grandest temples in Athens got the perfect priestess. The duties, the offerings, and the devotion were at a level unseen by Athena before. At the dawn of every week’s first day, Athena used to appear in the temple to meet the priestess. The Goddess posed riddles, discussed the recent developments in Olympus, or simply shared silence with the mortal. Those times energized the Goddess more than ambrosia could. During those conversations, butterflies flew in Athena’s stomach, and she could see the yearning in the mortal’s eyes. For the time being, she decided to keep her distance and tease the mortal some more. The bountiful sparks added a new flavor to her life.
She looked forward to them eagerly.
Medusa swayed her way to the temple from her home. The sun was rising, the sea reflecting the sky’s oranges and pinks beautifully. A smile touched her lips. Maybe, today would be the day that Athena would close the distance between them. Perhaps Athena was waiting for her to make the move. After all, who would appreciate bravado more than her?
Today, Medusa decided. Today I would say it all.
Just then, drizzle began. Medusa increased her pace, knowing the temple was still a stretch away. Her gut was pounding. A shadow fell on her shoulder. The scent of salt water hit her nose.
“Young lady,” said a hoarse voice. “I have seen none finer than you.”
Medusa turned and gasped. A muscular man with blue robes and dark, long hair towered over her. Yet, he looked more ugly than desirable to her. She clutched her white robe, which told the world that she was devoted to Athena.
“God Poseidon,” Medusa managed to say. “T-thank you for your compliments. I was headed to Goddess Athena’s temple.”
Medusa immediately knew that was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone in Poseidon’s eyes. As he took a step forward, she took a step back, her hands quivering.
Athena, she prayed, over and over. Athena.
Clouds grew darker over her. Huge waves began forming in the sea and crashing over the coast. It seemed that the God grew in size. Medusa fell backwards. Her heart pounded loudly.
“Are you denying the chance to be with me, young lady? Isn’t your name Medusa? Aren’t you the daughter of minor lords under ME?”
“Have mercy,” Medusa said, slithering backwards. “Mercy, Lord, I apologize, I am already devoted to Goddess Athena. ATHENA.”
Thunder crackled. Poseidon fell on her, twisting her arm, making her turn over. Medusa went numb. A golden light flashed somewhere. Poseidon cursed. Momentarily, the weight was removed from her. Through her tears and blood, Medusa saw two great lights clashing. A shrill shriek dominated the air. In horror, she realized Poseidon was coming towards her again as a wounded beast. She tried to stand. A force other than Poseidon hit her then, throwing her back. Poseidon cursed again, his shout shaking the ground. A cold, brutal wave crashed on her. The last thing Medusa was aware of was Athena’s tear-stricken face.
It seemed that she had been unconscious for ages. The ground was hard below, and there was a constant hissing around. When the memories set in, Medusa sat up straight and horrified.
Was it a dream?
She found herself in a cave overlooking the sea. Looking around, she was shocked to see her cousins — the Gorgons — sleeping in the corner. Perhaps Athena had made them guard her. They had their hair as hundreds of tiny snakes, their faces grey and what was generally considered monstrous. The hissing of their snakes filled her head. There was a small pool of water on the other end of the cave. Feeling the thirst, Medusa wandered towards it. Her reflection was not something she was prepared for. That was why the hissing sounded too loud. Her scream was loud enough to disturb the sea.When her throat could scream no more, her ears caught the sound of sobbing. Even without turning, Medusa knew who the person was. Pain like no other twisted in her heart.
“Medusa,” said Athena, her voice cracking. Medusa turned. When once those blue eyes glittered at the sight of the Goddess, now there was only blankness.
Medusa opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. She closed her eyes, hot tears splashing on her cheeks. Whatever had happened had to be a dream. Soon, her body was rocked by hefty sobs. Athena kept apologizing in the background, her eyes as red and swollen.
“If only I had claimed you sooner,” said Athena. “Would that have made a difference?” The Goddess crawled closer to Medusa, whom she had transformed into another Gorgon. “I am sorry, Medusa. I am sorry. I love you. This seemed the only viable solution to drive Poseidon away.” The Goddess gulped. “I could not defeat him.”
Looking at Medusa’s defeated face, Athena grabbed her shoulders, her voice betraying the pain she felt. “Tell me.
“I linger unseen, a shadow in light,I burden the heart, both day and night.I grow with your secrets, thrive on your pain,I bind you in chains, yet leave no stain.What am I?”
Medusa finally stared in the grey eyes. “Guilt.”
Slowly, legends about Medusa spread.
Some of them claimed that she could turn people into stone just by looking at them. Heroes began to seek her out, to win the confidence and support of people around. Medusa’s peaceful life began to be poked at again, by men. Athena knew she had to do something. Every time she thought of the incident, a knife twisted in her chest. Soon, a quiet trip to Hades was made. As depressing and spooky as the underworld was, Athena knew it was the path to Medusa’s salvation. Hades was hard to bargain with, but the presence of Persephone helped. Promptly, two gilded swords that held the power to never miss a strike were transported to Hades. His part of the bargain would come later.
In the meanwhile, a young and promising hero named Perseus, the son of Zeus, was rising in popularity.
One night, Athena paid a visit to him and whispered his task. He had to behead Medusa as painlessly as possible and bring the head to the Goddess. Perseus did not question the specifics and accepted a shield for the task, a shield that shone brighter than gold, that reflected better than a mirror. The hero set off. Athena helped him whenever she could without making it obvious, until he reached the infamous Rock Island.
Athena watched with bated breath.
The day of the final encounter arrived. Perseus entered the cave in the middle of the day. That was usually the time when the Gorgons slept. The statues of people around did not help his nerves. He gripped the shield tightly, a royal sword hanging by his waist, and tiptoed where Medusa slept. The unevenness of the ground made him fumble. He tripped, making the other statues around him crash to the ground. Then, it was deathly silent. His heart stopped as he heard the snarl of Medusa, the hissing of her snakes.
The moment she turned to him, he lifted the shield.
Medusa faltered. Perseus, his eyes closed, swung his sword, praying his strike was right. He heard a thing plop to the ground. Daring to look up, he saw the headless body of Medusa collapsing. The other Gorgons came for him, but Perseus made a dash, dodging over the fallen statues, managing to take the head of Medusa with him.
When the hero was back in his kingdom, Athena paid a visit to him. Perseus handed over the head and the shield back as promised.
After blessing him, she returned to her abode. In the space of her own, she fused the head of her lover with the shield. As she did the task, she knew it would be one of the deadliest weapons. Any ill-intentioned onlooker would be turned to stone through its use. A maiden in trouble could lift the weapon and fight off the attacker easily. Athena went on to keep it safely in the temple where Medusa had reigned for months.
Guilt still weighed heavy in Athena’s chest — no longer did she feel as mighty or as wise.
Yet, Medusa’s hearty afterlife in Elysium — courtesy of Hades — managed to ease some of it. After three attempts of visiting her, Medusa had finally made conversation with her. It had been short, but it was the only thing that had healed some part of Athena.
“Athena,” Medusa had said.
“I am a bridge that mends the torn,A balm where wounds and pain are born.I free the heart, untie the chain,And bring the sun through clouds of rain.
What am I?”
Athena had bowed her head to the spirit, experiencing the bittersweetness of the moment. “Medusa, the woman who opened my eyes and my heart, the answer is forgiveness.”

No other ancient city is as alive for us as Athens at the time of Socrates. Written sources are plentiful, and we do have a lot of Archaeological evidence — especially remarkable are the painted ceramics, showing the inhabitants of Athens in their houses, at the gymnasium, at war and all their other activities. All this allows us to use Plato’s Dialogues as a guide: skipping over the philosophical discussions, together with Socrates, we stroll through the city and enter the houses of its inhabitants.
Socrates reports: ‘At the earliest stages of dawn, Hippocrates came and started beating at my door with his stick; a slave opened the door for him, and he came rushing in and yelled out: Socrates, are you awake or asleep? [Hippocrates brings the news that Protagoras is in town and wants to visit him right away.] ‘Let’s not go there now, my good friend, it’s too early. But let’s go out into the courtyard here and spend the time until sunrise strolling around out…

A walk through history as you tour mill ruins, historic homes, and a battleground at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site.
The site is located about three hours north of St. Louis near the Iowa border.
We first stopped at the former Athens, Mo., General Store. The building is open to the outdoors and now serves as a picnic shelter. Inside you can read signs that describe the history of the store. It was once at the corner of Spring and Thome Street along a path that went down to the ferry that once crossed the Des Moines River.
A nearby sign shows the town at its height from 1853–1860 when it was an important port along the river pre-Civil War.
Next, we saw a monument explaining that the Battle of Athens on Aug. 5, 1861, was the northernmost Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River.
First, a short history lesson to better understand what happened here. Athens prospered until the outbreak of the Civil War. Settled by people from the upper South. Considered by Unionists to be a hotbed of pro-South sentiment. As the spring of 1861 moved into summer, northeast Missourians began choosing sides in the ever-widening national conflict.
Pro-Unionists rallied around David Moore, who had raised a force of about 500 men. Moore entered and occupied Athens on July 24, seizing homes and businesses from pro-South supporters to quarter and provision his troops. Pro-South supporters rallied around Col. Martin Green. Green raised a force of about 3,000 men, including two of Moore’s sons.
The confrontation between Moore’s and Green’s forces took place in Athens on Aug. 5, 1861. The battle began around 5 a.m. Moore and his Unionists were surrounded on three sides by Green’s troops, with the Des Moines River to their rear.
Despite being outnumbered at least five to one, Moore’s men were better trained and equipped.
After about two hours of fighting, at least 50 soldiers had been wounded or killed and the pro-South side was demoralized and in full retreat.
The big loser in the battle was the town of Athens. Bitter feelings between neighbors continued for decades following the Civil War. Athens was also hurt by the shift from the river to railroad transportation in the post-war era. By 1900, the once-thriving town was nearly gone.
(From the Battle of Athens State Historic Site website)
Along a former road, we went by a white picket fence surrounding a foundation. In front, a sign explains what happened after the battle.
A sign in front of the Benning House talks about the forming of Union troops in Northeast Missouri.
We happened to be up at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site when they were conducting tours so the historic homes were open to the public. I would call first to see if they are doing tours before you drive to the site if you want to see the inside of them.
Bedrooms are set up to that period including chamber pots, beds, a chest of drawers, and cabinets along with stoves.
My son pointed out the large piano and a nearby violin.
Fascinating were the intricate details of the patchwork quilt with ducks and even an 1800s girl with schoolbooks.
We then saw the large apple peeler at the end of a cabinet in the kitchen.
The most intriguing aspect of the house is the hole a cannonball left through the kitchen door, through the kitchen, and out the other wall. Although the cannonball harmed no one.
The cannonball fired from the artillery of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard hit the house during the Aug. 5, 1861 battle.
Next, we walked up the road to the Smith Hotel.
Here we found a weaver machine from the 1800s.
A corkboard had photos from the 1800s giving you a sense of the people and houses that were in the town back then.
Andrew checked out the rifles and guns on display.
Next, we walked out to the back where a large cannon is set up on the former battleground. Andrew stood in the back like he was about to fire it.
Then we walked over by the brick Moreland House and Wm. S. French House, abandoned homes in the town.
Next, we went down to the sign for the Mill Trail, which says it is a .3-mile one-way walk. Although, you can do it as a loop since the trail curves back up the hill a short way after passing the mill. This is also shown on the printout of the Mill Trail from the historic site’s website. The total walk is a .4-mile natural surface loop.
Heading down the wide mowed path we pass a ravine that goes into trees.
I spy a white mushroom growing on part of a log.
Below the hill, the trail goes to the left and we saw the brown rock mill remains. These remnants were from a mill constructed by Edward Colton. Built to withstand ice and flooding and stood on a 30-foot stone foundation with an additional four stores and had a water wheel. It was a grist and textile mill until the 1890s.
After checking out the mill we walked a short way along the river before coming to a trail that headed back up the hillside. You could continue along the river, but this is an unlisted trail.
At the top, you can take the White Connector trail to the 2.8-mile natural surface Snow Trillium Trail that goes along the river hills.
We headed back up into the former town to check out the Athens Mill Overlook boardwalk.
This is a good way to see the mill site without having to go down and up the river hill.
Along the boardwalk, you can also see remains of brown rock structures in the woods.
If you like history and ghost towns then this is a worthy trip to make if you are in northeast Missouri. A lot of history in a small area.
A fishing lake, picnic areas, and a playground.
Call 660–877–3871 for more information or to schedule a tour.
Drive: A little over three hour’s drive from the St. Louis Metro. Take Interstate 64 or Interstate 70 to U.S. 61 and go north. North of Wayland, Mo., make a left onto Missouri Highway C then a right onto Missouri Highway 81, and then a right onto Missouri Highway CC that leads to the historic site.
Hours: 7 a.m. — sunset, daily, year-round
Address: State Hwy CC, Revere, MO 63465
A national Civil War battlefield, a frog-shaped rock, and a devil’s elbow are some of what can be seen on the way from St. Louis to Branson!
Dennis Schick Trail includes historic sites and war machinery such as a World War II Sherman Tank in Jefferson Barracks Park in St. Louis County.
If you are heading up to Iowa City from St. Louis another stop is the Swinging Bridge in Columbus Junction, Iowa.
In Columbus Junction, Iowa, you can walk along a swinging bridge that is 262 feet above a dark ravine shrouded in a jungle-like forest.

Athens
Athens, Greece; June 13, 2019
Where to start. It’s so vulnerable to put writing– my ideas materialized for literally anyone to read– out on the internet. Yet, I feel like I need to start blogging. I mean, one day, this will be amazing to read and remember all the details of my life that are so present now. But not only that. I hope you guys (even if the only person reading is my mom) enjoy what you read and take something away from this.
OK. Time to get into what you’re here to read. Greece. Honestly, Greece is a logistical nightmare. Now, don’t get me wrong. Actually being in Greece is incredible. But, the getting there… now that’s a headache. Flying anywhere in Europe is an 8 hour flight or more– that’s a given. But to get to Santorini, it takes a flight from Nashville to New York and then another flight to Athens and then a ferry to the island. That adds up to be almost 24 hours of travel straight. A logistical nightmare. Planning the flights and ferries, doing time change and travel time math… needless to say we were exhausted when we arrived in Athens that first day. We had our ferry to Mykonos booked for the next morning, planning to spend one night in Athens to split up the day of travel. But, when in Athens, you have to visit the Parthenon. So what did we do that day? We visited the Parthenon.
Nashville’s Parthenon had not prepared me for the hike up to and the heat that encompassed the Grecian Parthenon. It was in the upper 90s when we went to the Parthenon, and I was sweating buckets. The Parthenon is on top of this huge peak in Athens, which is amazing in the sense that at the top, you can see a 360* view of the city. But on the other hand, the peak is that much closer to the sun, making walking around on the pavement surrounding the Parthenon feel like you are cooking on a hot grill. The view at the top was insane. Humbling. We could see the entire city below us, seeing the true insignificance of ourselves in the grand scheme of life. Yet, I also felt so important in that moment. The fact that I had traveled so many miles and was lucky enough to experience such an out-of-body moment in the most beautiful country I’d ever been, with the people I loved the most- it was a feeling I can’t find the words to describe.
We made our way down the mountainside (is it a mountain? I don’t really know… maybe a really big hill?) to find ourselves famished. In Europe, the restaurants operate way different from American ones. For one, there are rows and rows of restaurants directly next to each other, all with menus out front and all outdoor seating. Imagine Downtown Franklin, but no indoor seating and all the tables extended into the sidewalk. Also, you have to sit suuuuuper close to the people next to you in Europe when you eat. These are both due to the lack of space and expensive real estate in European cities. See, there are no skyscrapers in Europe; the restaurants are in original buildings. So, when searching for a restaurant, you can see the entire thing from the street and you kind of know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.
We walked down street upon street of crowded restaurants, searching for one that could accommodate the 5 of us and seemed to serve ~gluten free and vegan~ food. We finally found this one, which was literally the first one we saw and somehow skipped. This restaurant was at the foot of the Parthenon, with an incredible view of the Acropolis from below. (It’s called Athina Bistrot, if any of you are ever in Athens and need an amazing restaurant!) We were seated among locals, all of whom were enjoying casual coffee and business meetings amidst our day of tourism.
Another thing about Europe: they don’t serve you water. Ok, that’s dramatic. They do serve you water. But not in the way American restaurants do. Let’s take dinner at Cheesecake Factory for example. You sit and the waiter brings you a glass of water initially, refills when they bring you bread, refills when getting your food order, and again fills your glass when the food comes. And that’s not even including dessert. But in Europe, you have to ask for water and for refills. And the water comes from a glass bottle they leave at your table to refill. And here’s the catch: they charge you for each bottle. So, it is likely that one is dehydrated the majority of the time they are abroad. That being said, my family finished six. Let me repeat. Six bottles of water. Before we had even been served. We were parched–to say the least. Our waiter and the others dining in the restaurant found us comical- the group of 5 American tourists guzzling down upwards of $30 in water.
Our waiter. The reason I am writing this today. Actually, he and I are friends on Facebook so he may see this. So, if you’re reading this, Nikitas– hey! Nikitas was quite the conversationalist. His English was really good, so we were able to chat with him whilst inhaling our Greek salads. Every so often, I would look over into the kitchen to see Nikitas looking fondly at my family.
Every few minutes, Nikitas would come over to our table to check on us and start up a conversation about everything– to life in America and what we had planned for our trip. Here’s another thing about Europe that’s important to know here: they don’t give you the check. Again, I’m being dramatic. They do give you the check. But, in America, the minute you finish eating your food, they give you the check. This table turnover is the way American restaurants operate. The sooner they get you in and out, the more tables they can seat and the more tips they can make. But in Europe, they don’t give you the check immediately, you have to ask for it. European culture centers around eating and community, so the waitstaff don’t rush you out. Secondly, the restaurants in Europe stay open until the early morning hours, so there is not really a rush from the waiters to kick each table out. That being said, we sat at that table for hours sipping on our bottled waters and chatting with Nikitas.
Towards the end of our meal, Nikitas came by again. This time, he told us about his life. He was a single father raising his son, a son he saw as his world. He told us about the countless hours he worked just to make sure his son was well cared for. When Nikitas talked about his son, his eyes sparkled and he beamed. He opened up about how he envied the closeness of our family and how he loved seeing us together, happy.
That one hit home. I realized the true value of the moment I was living. I had all of my family together, at one table, in the most beautiful country, and here’s the kicker. We were happy. I began to think about how this moment was fleeting. Some day I would look back on this moment with such nostalgia, such joy. I felt a twinge of sadness, I knew I would miss this moment and I was currently living in it. Nostalgia for the present is such a powerful thing. I missed this moment before it was even over.
This idea taught me to hold on much tighter to what I experience that is good. I now feel as though I collect moments and memories, rather than let them pass idly by. I have grown to miss moments whilst living them, knowing the exact laughs and conversations are irreplaceable. And after my whole life, not stopping to realize the impermanence memories, it took Nikitas, a waiter in Athens to teach me. I took that lesson and ran. I lived that trip with the intention to remember and cherish every moment.
We left Athens the next morning and embarked on two weeks of Grecian life in Mykonos and Santorini. And trust me, the stories I have about the rest of the trip will be told in their entirety on future blog posts… Get excited ;)
Back to logistics. A ferry back to Athens was the first leg of the trip back home to Nashville. Again, we stayed in Athens for a night before we took a flight to New York and then another one to Nashville. When we arrived in Athens, I knew there was one thing I wanted to do. Eat at that restaurant.
My family and I made our way back to the restaurant he worked at– hoping he would be our waiter again. He was there. A reminder of the fleeting nature of the present and the necessity of cherishing every moment.

Athens, the capital of Greece, is a dynamic metropolis in southeastern Europe. With an area of around 39 km², it is relatively small compared to other European capitals, but its cultural and historical wealth makes it a place of exceptional importance.
In 2021, Athens had a population of around 664,046, making it Greece’s most populous city. It is the country’s political, economic and cultural center. The city is famous for its emblematic ancient monuments, including the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the ancient Agora, which bear witness to its rich historical heritage.
Athens is divided into several districts, but has no official arrondissements like some other metropolises. The city has a complex administrative organization, with subdivisions such as districts, municipalities and suburbs.
Geopolitically, Athens is of strategic importance due to its geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea. It plays a central role in Greece’s politics and economy, as well as in the region’s international relations. The city is home to numerous government institutions, embassies and international organizations.
In addition to its historical heritage, Athens is also renowned for its Mediterranean cuisine, lively neighborhoods, colorful markets and vibrant nightlife. Visitors can explore its museums, theaters and art galleries, as well as enjoy the breathtaking views from the Acropolis hill.
Athens, with its fascinating blend of past and present, is a must for travelers seeking history, culture and the excitement of a major European city.
Athens has a rich history stretching back thousands of years, with roots deeply rooted in Greek mythology. Here’s a summary of key moments in the city’s history from its legendary beginnings.
Athens takes its name from the Greek goddess Athena, who is said to have won a contest with Poseidon to become the city’s protector. According to legend, she gave the city an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity, and thus Athens was born.
The first traces of human occupation in Athens date back to the Bronze Age, around 3000 BC. At that time, it was a small farming community.
Athens developed during the Archaic period (800–500 BC), becoming a powerful city-state with a system of government based on nascent democracy.
The 5th century BC is often referred to as Athens’ Golden Age. Under the leadership of Pericles, the city flourished culturally, politically and economically. It was during this period that monuments such as the Parthenon were built.
Athens played a crucial role in the Median Wars (490–479 BC), repelling the Persian invasion and consolidating its position in Greece.
Athens was embroiled in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), a devastating conflict with its rival Sparta. This war weakened Athenian power.
In 338 BC, Athens fell under the domination of Philip II of Macedon, then his son, Alexander the Great.
After the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens lost some of its political importance, but became a cultural center of the Roman Empire.
Under the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, Athens continued to be a prosperous city, although it suffered barbarian invasions and unrest over the centuries.
From the 15th century onwards, Athens fell under Ottoman domination, a period that lasted until the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century.
The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) led to the liberation of Athens and the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830.
Contemporary times: Since independence, Athens has become the capital of Greece, playing a key role in the country’s political, cultural and economic development. It hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has continued to thrive as a cultural and intellectual center.
Today, Athens remains a crossroads of history and culture, bearing witness to its long and fascinating history from its modest mythological beginnings to its status as a dynamic, modern metropolis.
Athens is packed with historic, cultural and picturesque sites to discover as a tourist. Here are ten must-see places to visit when you’re in Athens:
This is Athens’ most emblematic site, home to the majestic Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Theater of Dionysus. The Acropolis offers a panoramic view of the city.
This historic site is home to ancient temples, stelae and monuments. It was the heart of public life in Athens in ancient times.
This world-renowned museum displays an impressive collection of artifacts and sculptures from the Acropolis, providing a valuable backdrop to a visit to the site itself.
Watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony in front of the Parliament building on Syntagma Square. The building itself is a magnificent example of neoclassical architecture.
Explore the winding, picturesque streets of Plaka, one of Athens’ most charming districts, with its boutiques, tavernas and colorful houses.
This museum houses a vast collection of ancient artifacts, including sculptures, jewelry and archaeological treasures, offering a comprehensive overview of Greek history.
Climb to the top of this hill for breathtaking panoramic views of Athens, especially at sunset.
Visit this lively district for its flea market, cafés, vintage stores and the famous Monastiraki square.
Discover this ancient marble stadium, which was restored to host the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
If you have time, take a trip outside Athens to admire the temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, located on the seafront and offering spectacular views of the Aegean Sea.
These sites offer a comprehensive overview of the history, culture and beauty of Athens, giving you an unforgettable experience in this fascinating city.
A world-renowned Greek philosopher, Plato was the founder of the Academy of Athens, one of the world’s first institutions of higher learning. His philosophical dialogues, notably “The Republic”, have influenced Western thought for centuries.
A pupil of Plato, Aristotle was another renowned philosopher from Athens. His contributions to philosophy, biology, politics and metaphysics had a lasting impact on many disciplines.
Athenian historian, Thucydides is the author of “The Peloponnesian War”, a detailed account of the war between Athens and Sparta. His work is considered a masterpiece of history and politics.
An influential Greek politician, Venizelos was Prime Minister of Greece four times in the early 20th century. He played a major role in the reforms and political events of his era, including the Balkan Wars and the First World War.
Actress and politician, Melina Mercouri was a passionate cultural ambassador for Greece. She won the Prix d’interprétation féminine at the Cannes Film Festival in 1960 for her role in “Jamais le dimanche” and served as Greece’s Minister of Culture, fighting for the restitution of the Parthenon marbles.
These Athens personalities have left a lasting imprint in fields ranging from philosophy to politics to cinema, helping to shape the history and culture of Greece and the world.
In order to conclude, if you have any ideas for improving this type of article (adding a section, for example), please let me know in the comments.

A literary translation of my thoughts on cities, public spaces, urbanism etcetera.

This one came to me as a volunteer assignment from Laneway Project, a nonprofit organisation in Toronto that works to convert laneways to vibrant public spaces. As researcher and writer, I was asked to study best practices in laneway projects across the world and write about any one of them. Since another volunteer had already researched examples from the US & Australia, I was left to get more creative and research about lesser known examples from the non-English-speaking world.
There were four projects that were interesting to study — the Dashilar project in Beijing that revived a traditional urban hutong in the city; the revival of Gaengeviertel in Hamburg by artists and citizens to prevent its demolition; a project called BioUrban in Sao Paulo led by a sociologist who lived and worked in a favela to develop a sense of stewardship among the favela dwellers and lastly, Atenistas — a citizen group in Athens that is run exclusively by volunteers to regenerate dead spaces in Athens and make people fall in love (again) with Athens.
Tough as it may be, I had to choose one of these projects to write on. I think what really pulled me towards Atenistas was the community spirit and love for the city they seemed to be injecting into Athens and its people. And so, I began to write about them. To read the article, click here.

A week ago, we drove 30 kilometers to Athens. We had to do a hospital check-up, which turned out to finish quickly.
It was broad daylight in Athens at that time, and we didn’t feel like driving back 30 kilometers to home immediately. So, we decided to do something in the city. We had plenty of time until dusk.
There were several Asian restaurants in Athens with cuisine that I wanted to taste. Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, and Indonesian foods were among the options I was curious about. To kill time, we therefore opted to have lunch at an Asian restaurant.
After comparing the opening hours of several restaurants, we finally picked an Indonesian restaurant. It was the only one ready to accept hungry visitors. Other restaurants would open later, in the afternoon or evening.
Without further ado, we drove off to Agios Nikolaos.
The Indonesian restaurant that we were about to visit was Lombok Red Chili—lombok means ‘chili’ in Indonesian.

After my emotional post talking about seeing the Acropolis and Parthenon from afar I thought I would now share our experience of seeing it all up close and personal.
We decided to go and visit the site on our third day in Athens and set off nice and early to make sure we had a full day to take it all in.
We walked through the city feeling excited and with the boys chatting a lot about what they were expecting to see. I understand why people use taxis and other public transport to get around cities but if you are physically able I really recommend walking. As you approach the main entrance to the hill you come through a village within the city called Plaka. It’s one of the oldest parts of the city and is full of quaint winding roads filled with cafés, restaurants, tourist shops and jewellery stores. You’ll pay more for food and goods here as they are hoping to entice the excited overseas visitors but if you go just for the atmosphere and hold back from getting the credit card out it’s really charming.
We made our way through the maze of small streets and approached the top of the hill. Before you get to the main entrance, over to your right you will see a rocky outpost jutting up in front of you. This is called Areopagus Hill (or Mars Hill) and if you like your Christian history this is the hill where the Apostle Paul delivered his famous “sermon in the mount”.
There are some steps up to the top and it’s really worth taking 5 minutes to head up and take in the views. You can see Plaka beneath you stretching out to the city beyond and behind you is the Parthenon, sitting grandly at the top of the hill. This is where you get your first full view of the size and magnificence of the place.
After we’d had our fill of this view we made our way over to the ticket office. We’d read that in the summer it can get really busy but on this warm December day just before Christmas it was fairly quiet and we didn’t have to queue at all. There were quite a few tour guides eager for us to use their services but we’d decided to go at our own pace and so politely, but increasingly firmly, said no thank you.
In the winter season you pay €10 for adult tickets with children getting in for free (the adult price is doubled through the summer). Your ticket gives you access to the whole site which is massive so well worth the money we thought.
We entered through the ticket barriers and tried to get our bearings a little. There’s a hill straight in front of you that takes you up to the Parthenon itself and then pathways leading away to your left and right, we took the right hand path and started to wander along.
One of the first things we saw was The Odeon of Herodes Atticus. This is a fairly “modern” part of the site because although the original theatre was built in 161 CE, over the years it was left to ruin before being rebuilt in the 1950’s and it is still used for drama and musical productions throughout the year. The seating area is solid marble and really impressive. You can also see this structure from the road behind the Parthenon site and it’s worth taking a wander at some point while in Athens to see both angles.
Carrying on past the Odeon there are collections of pillars, engraved stones and other treasures that have been excavated from the site over time. A very serious security guard is on hand to be sure no one is touching but you can go right up the stones, getting really close and trying to make out the faded drawings and writing which we thought was great.
A little further along is the Theatre of Dionysus. Much older than it’s Odeon counterpart and would have been used to showcase the first Greek tragedies in the 6th Century BCE. Dionysus was god of many things including wine making, festivity and theatre and we thought he sounded a fun god to have around.
We then wandered around the rest of the gardens on that side of the hill, you can see more artifacts dotted about and there are plenty of information signs in both Greek and English that fill in any of the gaps in knowledge that you might have. On the south side of the hill, high up from ground level is the entrance to The Forgotten Monument of Thrysallus. An ancient entrance to a temple that is now sadly too damaged to enter safely. The doorway, with it’s white columns, stark against the surrounding rock looks really enticing and I hope that they are able to restore and reopen this impressive monument one day.
Having seen all there was to see at ground level we now began to make our way up the uneven paths towards the Parthenon itself.
If you are ever here you must make sure you enter through the Propylaea, this is the original entrance where Athenians through the ages would have entered to seek knowledge or help or to pray and it’s really a grand sight. We took some time to sit on the steps, drinking in the atmosphere. It was a little busy but not overwhelming and everyone was mindful and respected other’s personal space. Other than signs asking you to please not touch the marble, it’s all open and again you can get really close to the pillars and stonework that make up the walk way to the top of the Acropolis.
Once at the top of the stairs the floor levels off, there is always work being done on the site and they have apparently spent a long time in recent years improving access. So although the pathways around the temples are rocky and uneven there is a smooth path right through the middle making it much more accessible to those with mobility issues.
There is so much to see once at the top, the highlight of course being the Parthenon itself, the largest structure and centrepiece of the site (this is the one you see on posters, postcards and websites — the one you can see from all around the city). Plenty of scaffolding around the temple does not detract from it’s size and grandeur. Take some time to study the pillars, looking at the hand carved detail is astonishing. We did at least two laps of the building before moving on.
My favourite thing to see was the temple of Athena — with it’s reproduction statues of the goddess around the front (you can see the originals in the Acropolis museum), it’s really a site worth seeing. If you can manage some steps and uneven ground go around the back to see the enormous entrance door to get a perspective of what it would have been like for members of the public coming to pray and offer gifts to the goddess.
The last thing I’ll point out as a “must do” up here is to go to the far end of the site and up a few steps to the Acropolis View point. This looks back over the Parthenon and other temples giving you a wonderful vantage point (and if you are feeling brave you can also peer over the top at the sheer drop down the side of the Acropolis back to street level! Warning this is not an activity for those, like my dear husband, who are worried about heights).
There are of course many other sites to see, smaller temples like Athena Nike (which was painstakingly taken apart, renovated and then put back together again in the late 1990's), as well as other areas of restoration. If you go with children see if they can spot the metal tracks that circle the site which are used to move the huge stones and marble structures as work is carried out.
After we had had our fill of Greek history we slowly made our way back down through the grand entrance and back down the hill. It takes some time, partly because it’s all quite uneven and a little slippery but partly because you just can’t stop looking at the architecture and small treasures to be found around each new corner.
We left the site through the smaller entrance on the South side, along the pedestrianised walkway of Dionysiou Areopagitou. I understand that this entrance is mostly used for tour groups and school visits but in the summer can be less busy than the main entrance for individuals needing to buy tickets.
The entrance to the Acropolis Museum is also along this walkway, we did the museum visit on a different day but if you are only in Athens for a short time it would definitely make sense to do both in the same day as they are so close. I would really recommend seeing the Acropolis first as it was fabulous to see the friezes, statues and pillars in the museum and be able to picture where you would have seen them up on the hill.
Like so many people seeing the Parthenon and spending time on the Acropolis was one of the big reasons for our visit to this city and it did not disappoint. Here are some final tips that I think would make your visit go smoothly:
* Wear good comfy, study shoes. They are making big improvements to accessibility on the site but there are lots of uneven pathways, steps and slippery surfaces so open toed sandals would not be a great choice of footwear.
* Bring plenty of water. It was a warm day when we went and with the amount of walking we did we needed plenty of hydration, I imagine it can get quite uncomfortable in the summer months.
* Read up about some the Greek gods before you go, in particular Athena, Psoiedon, Zeus and Dionysus. It was really great to bring those names to life as we saw the temples and read the information signs.
* If you are going to visit more than one or two archaeological sites you can buy combination tickets which can end up saving you money.
*Decide beforehand if you would like to use a guide while you are there so you can be confident in saying yes or no to the people who approach you at the ticket entrances.
Comment below if you’ve found this useful or if you’ve been yourself and would add any other tips :-)

It’s currently day 5, and I should say first off that it’s pretty hard to get started on writing right now. That’s not because I’m exhausted from all the cycling and heat and general intensity (although I very much am). Rather, it’s the opposite. It’s because I’m laid back in the perfect deckchair, reclined at the perfect angle, looking out at the perfect view from my perfect rest-day holiday home which I snagged for the perfect — and perfectly ridiculous — price of £33 a night.
But it hasn’t all been this sweet. Far from it.
Let’s rewind a bit.
Athens was good to me, all things considered. This is a blog about bike touring so I won’t go into too much detail regarding my holiday affairs, but a few choice notes before we continue:
Verdict: I thoroughly recommend Athens as a city to visit. Don’t hesitate if you get the chance.
Anyway, let’s get this bike tour started!
I’d been waiting for the bike tour anxiety to arrive for months, and it was only on the morning of leaving that it hit me. But I don’t think it was the tour as a whole I was afraid of; it was simply getting out of Athens. I’ve been to cities with worse traffic, but I’ve also been to cities with much better.
I tried to make the most of the €4 all-you-can-eat breakfast, shovelling spoonfuls of oats into my mouth, but the nerves weren’t allowing my stomach to settle. I did my best to force it all down, figuring that I’d just throw some of it up if need be. My body would work it out.
I’d reassembled my bike the previous day and had all my bags packed, so I’m not quite sure how it took me a further hour to get going, but that’s what happened. Eventually I was ready, and, after some rejigging of the panniers (does one ever just jig?), I was on my wobbly wobbly way out of the hostel and into the streets of Athens. I had begun!
And then, not 10 seconds later, I stopped. Brake calibration issues would in fact plague me for the next hour or so, but eventually I got those suckers under control and started to build some momentum. As for the streets of Athens, they were remarkably easy to navigate (Komoot certainly helped). There were plenty of bike lanes, pink and quiet and well-paved, and within just a few minutes of finding them all my fears of getting squashed by a passing fruit cart were put to rest.
The bike lanes eventually ended and I had no choice but to take to the roads, but these weren’t too much trouble. There was one hill which to this day remains the steepest hill I’ve climbed — we’re talking cheese-rolling levels here — but after I’d tidied my lungs back into my chest, the rest of Athens was plain sailing.
Talking of sailing, next up was the Port of Piraeus, where I’d been told I could board a ferry to Salamina, a necessary stepping stone on the way out of Greece. I asked around and was told a boat would come ‘soon’. Four people gave me the same answer. I waited for the boat. And waited. And waited. Was ‘soon’ actually the Greek word for ‘you’re in the wrong place, my friend’?
It might well have been. Eventually, the fifth person I asked told me that I was indeed at the wrong port and that I’d need to get to Perama. Alrighty then. Another 10km of riding, this stretch significantly less enjoyable as I shared main roads with speeding cars, and I was finally at the right port just as the ferry was about to leave. I rolled the bike onto the ferry and gave myself a pat on the back for making it through the streets of Athens.
Riding in Salamina was great, my first experience of the treats to come. An appetiser, if you will. Lightly undulating hills carried me past glittering waters under a clear blue sky, and there was a pretty horse somewhere too. It wasn’t long before I had to stop for my first photoshoot — the first of many, I’m not ashamed to say.
After an hour or so, I reached the next ferry that would take me back to the mainland. Rolling my bike onto the ferry, a man in overalls began yelling at me:
‘Look at the cones, look at the cones, what do they mean!?’
Smiling dumbly, I told him I didn’t know what the cones meant, but, goodness me, there’s a strong smell of paint in here, isn’t there?
It turned out I had rolled my bike straight over his freshly painted deck. Whoopsie. The paint wasn’t wet enough to cling to my tyres — a shame, cornflower blue wheels would have been quite fetching — but he gave me an earful nonetheless. I made my silly-tourist apologies and parked up my bike, breathing in the good if slightly painty sea air as we made the crossing.
Back on the mainland, I experienced some hillier sections for the next hour or so. My legs hadn’t yet adjusted to the work required and I found this pretty tough going. However, it was made much easier by the scenery I was passing through: looming dusty-orange cliff faces to the right, sparkling ocean to the left. And also by the driver who gave me the rocker sign as he passed me in his van. Thank you, stranger.
Away from the coast, I had my first encounter with aggressive dogs. This was to become a frequent occurrence. You hear the barks first of all, not quite sure which direction they’re coming from, and then suddenly there’s a four-legged creature all slobber and fury rushing towards you. I’ve become a little more used to it by now, but it still jars, and the first time was a pretty hairy experience.
At one point, the dogs wouldn’t stop chasing me and I was worried about them getting caught in the wheels, so I stopped, put the bike between myself and the dogs, and in my best angry-dad voice, commanded ‘STOP, BAD DOG, GO HOME’. And did they listen? Reader, they did not. They just snarled and barked and bared their impressive canines.
But, next time, I’d be ready for them. Oh, I’d be ready for them. I’d slipped my ultrasonic dog repeller into my pocket for easy access and, at the first sound of barking, I wielded my wand like Ron Weasley at a pack of fluffy dementors.
Be gone, vile beasts! I might or might not have yelled.
And, astonishingly, it worked! At least kind of. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting anything at all from this unassuming bit of plastic, and it’s true that the device didn’t stop them from chasing me all together. But once I clicked that magic button, they seemed to fall back to a safer distance. And oh, the power I felt… This Ron might just become his own Voldemort.
As the day was drawing to a close and my energy reserves were being depleted, I stopped off for the perfect refuel: a pita filled with chips and gyros. This I shared with a much nicer chap than the ones who had come before. Maybe it was the food, but this dog was just an absolute pal. Perhaps I should be wielding chicken gyros at my attackers rather than a plastic stick in future.
I finally reached my campsite in Ancient Corinth at around 7.30pm. I didn’t want to wild camp, deciding that it would be best for the first night to be somewhere I felt safe and could get a decent night’s rest.
The former worked out well; the latter, not so much. Dogs barked from all sides deep into the night and, as I had left my earplugs in my panniers and was tucked up (un)comfortably in my tent, I couldn’t bring myself to go outside and get them. Eventually, at around 1.30am and with the chorus of howls still in full swing, I succumbed and dragged myself out of the tent.
It was a smart move. There is a singular pleasure to wandering out of your tent in the dead of night — the stars, the moon, the exquisite isolation. As I stood there craning my neck up at the sky, feeling impossibly small and yet entirely undiminished, I felt a deep sense of good will from the universe. The trip had begun, and everything was going to be okay.
Distance covered: 94km / Elevation gained: 740m

Welcome to Athens, Mississippi. Athens is an unincorporated community just a few minutes outside of the small town that I reside in. But, somehow, I had never explored it.
I assembled a dream team of myself, Davis Helton, and Luke Johnson (Davis would kill me if he didn’t have a shout-out), and we decided to delve deep into this lost community to visit the long-fabled Athens Jail.
Built in 1830, the jail is somewhat mysterious, with stories of ghosts running abound in my community. According to the fine folks at the Monroe County Historical Society (this society is truly top notch, keeping records and finding stories of a small community with little publicity), Joshua Toomer created the current structure of the jail in 1845. Later that night, Toomer drunkenly hopped on the wrong horse and was accused of being a horse thief. This accusation landed him the luxury of being the first person to stay a night in this newly founded jail.
It is no surprise that ghostly rumors would be abundant for a building of this nature. This is where things get a little murky, as the jail kept no records as to who exactly died there and how.

Kelly May Sheehan — UX Researcher, Designer, and Developer
Zoë Phalen — UX Researcher, Designer, and Developer
During my Emerging Media Master’s program, I developed a capstone project in place of a thesis. I partnered with my peer, Zoë Phalen, to create Athens Era.
The final task on the capstone journey requires individuals and teams to present their project at the event, Emerge. This event invites students, faculty, alumni, and guests to celebrate the completion of the degree and each capstone project. Each team takes the spotlight and provides an overview of their completed work.
I created an e-ccomerce marketplace website for local artists of Athens, GA along with my partner for our capstone project, called Athens Era. I worked on developing the website, while producing supporting materials. All materials and deliverables may be accessed on our project website, here.
We developed our capstone project in separate stages, and documented our progress with youtube videos. Our full capstone journey can be viewed on our youtube playlist, here.
At the beginning of this course, we already produced our capstone website in its alpha stage. We started with developing our website in its beta stage, with guidance from the results of our user research and testing.
We had identified the website’s issues, but finding the solution for each was our challenge.
With each stage of development, we focused on separate issues we identified during our research:
One of our biggest leaps in development, was when we created additional graphics to match our brand and help tell the story of what Athens Era is. They really helped show how Athens Era is a credible platform for artists and assisting in storytelling throughout the website. Here are a few graphics:
Beyond the development of our capstone website, we created a poster to promote our final project. With this poster, we aimed to clearly communicate what Athens Era is and attract people to the website. This would help solve the issue of: “weak recognition of website for only Athens, GA artists” before people first visit the website.
Of course, we also addressed the weak recognition of the website for only Athens artists by changing our information architecture and wording for more clarity.
Along with the poster, we also created a trailer for the promotion of Athens Era. We began with a storyboard of our original idea for the production of the trailer.
Later, we iterated our storyboard to reflect our final trailer, which may be viewed here.
We used Canva to produce our trailer after trying out different videos platforms. Due to our lack of video production equipment, we opted to use Canva for its digital animations and resources for a fully digitally designed trailer, as opposed to using raw footage we could have filmed form our phones.
After we uploaded all of our deliverables to our project website and concluded our development on Athens Era, we presented our results at the New Media Institute’s end of year event, Emerge.
Our Emerge presentation summarizes our capstone journey and demos our functioning website and its notable features.
We spoke about the inspiration of the project, along with our ideation methods, research, and development.
The Athens Era Emerge Presentation may be viewed here.
Throughout this course, I learned how to effectively communicate with an audience through digital and physical products. I am pleased with the completion of our capstone project and how much I have developed my storytelling skills.

Greece is one of the oldest, most authentic, and most delicious countries you can ever visit.
Besides its magnificent culture and history, Greek cuisine is something you need to try!
A lot of the Greek delights are similar to the food we are used to having here in Egypt, but with an exquisite twist!
Meat is vital in Greek cuisine. You have three dishes that you may think are the same: Souvlaki, Gyro, and Kebap.
Souvlaki means skewer, so it’s basically anything grilled on a skewer; could be meat, chicken, or lamb, usually served on a dish, but sometimes also gyro-style. Yummy!
Eating at Thanasis, a very famous local souvlaki place.(Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is the most traditional 2-euro food in Greece.
Meat is grilled vertically and then sliced (like shawarma), rolled in the delicious Greek “pita” bread, and sauced with the most famous Greek sauce: tzatziki (you may think you have tried it in Egypt, but trust me, it is not the same).
Fun fact: almost every gyro place in Athens has Egyptian workers!
Enjoying gyros from a local Greek place (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is the last of the meat trio. It looks like “kofta,” but much more delicious, with a different set of spices. It is also larger in size and more fatty and is usually served gyro-style. This is also cheap, 2 euro food.
4- Mousaka
This is like pasta-free lasagne, made up of eggplants, zucchini, minced meat, and potatoes, topped with onions and tomatoes and covered in bechamel and sometimes grilled cheese. It is a traditional delicious dish you must try.
Eating Spinakotapa for breakfast. I can do that every day. (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is a personal favorite. I hardly love spinach, but this spinach pie has changed what I think about vegetables!
It is a pastry pie filled with green sautéed spinach, sometimes with grilled cheese or feta cheese, available in different shapes and sizes. Personally, I can have this for breakfast every single day!
No Greek food list should miss tzatziki! This sauce is the most common appetizer and the most delicious dipping for almost anything. Whether you are eating chips, eggplant, or meat, tzatziki works as a perfect dip. Or you can just eat it with a pita!
Deep-fried feta cheese! Here in Egypt, we are used to having “Roumi” cheese fried, but feta? You should try this!
Simply zucchini balls. I’m not a big fan of zucchini at all, but Greece taught me that I am wrong! Almost any food that contains zucchini here is utterly delicious. I even had zucchini pizza!
Try this one and change how you feel about zucchini forever.
Zucchini balls and Saganaki, are delicious Greek specialties. (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Some of you might be familiar with this. It is an old recipe that my grandpa used to make for us but is rarely found anywhere now. It is a very simple recipe of oil, sugar, semolina flour, and water.
It is like a greenish pudding with a truly mesmerizing sweet taste. You should give it a try.
Although it looks exactly like your regular “konafa,” I promise you, it’s not the same!
Kanataifi is more creamy, frothy, and sweet. It literally melts in your mouth. You should have one!
Chilling in my favorite Athens neighborhood, the Plaka (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
These are just some of the Greek delights! The list is longer than we can fit in one article. There is Loukoumades, Galaktoboureko, Fava, Baklava, Taramosalata, and your good old Greek salad too!
You will gain a couple of kilograms in Athens, that’s for sure.

Last week I attended the NT Live broadcast of Nicholas Hytner’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at The Bridge Theatre and it is an experience which I will never forget. Just as Peter Brook’s seminal RSC production struck a chord in the 1970s with its minimalist staging and darker, adult take on Shakespeare’s comedy, so I expect director Hytner’s immersive, pop culture savvy production to become one which defines future Dreams for decades to come.
Despite the largely carnivalesque tenor of this production (which felt as palpable in the cinema as in the theatre), the production opened on an unexpectedly sombre note. A procession of black clad men and women entered the stage singing in plain chant, thus conjuring a funereal mood as opposed the ‘nuptial hour’ promised in Theseus’s (Oliver Chris) opening line.
The costumes of the female characters, the audience had been told in the opening commentary before the production began, were supposedly evocative of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, which has found renewed cultural currency in recent years due to a successful television adaptation and its resonance with contemporary feminist movements such as #MeToo.
This was underlined by the production’s first (of many) spectacular effects as Hippolyta (Gwendoline Christie) was transported onstage, trapped inside a sleek glass cage which reminded the audience of her status as a captive queen, a fact over which so many productions choose to elide. Gemma wrote about this aspect of the production in detail in her article earlier this week, offering a deeper dive into that image and its connections to Christie’s role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones.
Not only is Hippolyta a prisoner to a conquering duke but Hermia (Isis Hainsworth) is also greatly mistreated in this opening scene as it is assumed that she is the property of both her father and intended husband, despite her protestations that she wishes to marry another man of her choosing. The decision to draw out these more insidious themes from one of Shakespeare’s most beloved comedies by connecting them to memorable feminist imagery in popular culture was therefore highly astute.
One of the key feature’s of this production were the modern linguistic additions to Shakespeare’s text which, although initially jarring in the serious opening scenes at court, felt incredibly natural once delivered by the Rude Mechanicals in their first appearance onstage. The Bridge Theatre’s immersive pit also allowed actors to use the audience in inventive and involving ways, such as when the Mechanicals wish to consult a ‘calendar’ in Act 3 Scene 1 to know whether the moon will shine during their performance.
Given the ‘extra-textual’ additions to Shakespeare’s text already established early on in the production, it therefore made perfect sense for the cast to break out into the audience and decide to consult the Calendar app in an audience member’s phone. This not only updated the scene to incorporate the changing sense of what the word ‘calendar’ means but gave way to hilarious unspoken remonstrations when the Mechanicals became side-tracked by looking through said phone at images which we can only assume were illicit. The extract from the broadcast below features this moment in all its glory.
Hammed Animashaun’s extraordinary Bottom shone particularly brightly during these anachronistic moments. His naturalistic delivery and a wide comedic range encompassed everything from deadpan moments able to draw laughs by the merest eyebrow raise to the best version of Pyramus’s ludicrously overlong and overblown suicide which I’ve ever witnessed.
However, it would be remiss not to mention Felicity Montagu’s understated Quince, who provided the perfect foil for her shrieking, scene-stealing counterpart. There was a perfectly acute balance between tension and affection at the heart of their relationship. Despite Bottom’s leading thespian/backseat director pushing against the rules imposed by Quince’s put-upon actor-manager, it was nevertheless clear that they were pulling in the same direction and this ensured that those scenes were some of the production’s best.
In a further attempt to redress the gender imbalance and biases of Shakespeare’s play, Hytner chose to swap many of the lines delivered by Oberon (Oliver) and Titania (Christie). It is this decision, perhaps, that served the production most effectively. Now with the lion’s share of the lines, Christie was a truly powerful Titania, displaying brilliant armography (thanks Strictly) and radiating majestical power which will be familiar to anyone who has seen her steal each Game of Thrones scene in which she features.
The reversal of Fairy King and Queen was particularly effective in the inclusion of a subtle twist at the play’s end that — thanks to Oliver and Christie playing both the magical and mortal monarchs — Hippolyta may have secretly conjured the fairy kingdom to terrorise her husband-to-be. Hytner chose to keep this ambiguous but it was an inspired suggestion and made sense of the decision to have the same two actors play these roles.
Christie was ably supported by a nimble, creepy, day-glo Puck, played by David Moorst who delivered a brilliantly original iteration of the beloved fairy: think Lee Evans meets Willem Dafoe. Moorst not only displayed a spectacular array of acrobatics but oscillated between mischievous contempt for the lovers he poisoned and genuine pathos once he realised the extent to which they had suffered. Like Animashaun, his delivery of the extra-textual additions felt incredibly natural, whilst the blurring of the fairy and courtly world were sinisterly underscored by his additional role as a quietly malevolent Philostrate.
An example of the production’s attention to detail and its capacity to elevate oft-forgotten moments in this oft-performed play was Philostrate’s address to the three couples prior to the Rude Mechanicals’ performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Prior to Theseus selecting their play, an array of other options are delivered by Philostrate and, rather than skate over these in the audience’s anticipation of Dream’s grand comedic climax, Hytner instead chose to have actors (who had already featured as fairies) appear onstage to represent those alternatives.
These ranged from a group of women grotesquely entangled in red balloons to a vaudevillian entertainer creating a paper chain of people, all of which was in service of an inspired final gag. Theseus’s decision was framed as a reality television-esque winner reveal, underscored by ever-diminishing lights and the dramatic music which erupted once the Mechanicals had been selected. Their adorable purple jumpers (which read ‘Rude Mechanicals’ on the back) underscored their position as amateurs amidst professionals. Truly, Athens Got Talent.
In my next article, I’ll focus in greater detail on these references to modern culture and, in particular, the popular music which featured throughout this dream of a show.

After checking out the Aegean Business Class Lounge it was time to board my Aegean business class flight from Athens to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my itinerary and how I booked the trip. Also see previous reviews of the ground experience in Newark for Emirates passengers, SAS Lounge at Newark, the Emirates business class flight from Newark to Athens, and my stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked this flight by transferring my Amex Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan, a program that typically has good redemption values.
In this case, the cost was 15,000 miles for business class, plus $86.50 in Canadian dollars in taxes and fees. I charged the taxes and fees to my Amex Platinum to take advantage of the 5x per dollar on airfare, no foreign transaction fees, and the generous travel protection benefits it offers.
For this flight, there was a coach seat available for 7,500 miles. And as a Star Alliance Gold member, I would have received priority check-in, baggage handling, and lounge access anyway. However, I decided the premium of 7,500 miles was worth it to try the experience, even if it only consisted of a blocked middle seat and perhaps better food for the 2-hour hop. This was my first flight on Aegean so I wanted the full experience.
I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate for my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV).
At the gate, I was surprised that there was not much by way of added security. Usually, flights to Israel feature additional security.
Boarding began relatively on time. Aegean elites, Business Class, and Star Alliance Gold passengers were invited to board immediately after the pre-board for young families and the disabled.
Priority boarding did seem to be enforced by the Aegean gate crew which is always appreciated.
Boarding moved pretty quickly and we pushed back relatively on time. There was a safety demonstration in Greek and English and we briefly taxied before taking off.
I was welcomed at the cabin door and directed to my seat in the small forward cabin. Aegean has an exclusively narrow-body fleet and even a few propeller planes. This flight was operated by one of Aegean’s Airbus A320 aircraft.
As is standard for European short-haul business, the Aegean business class cabin was standard coach seats with a blocked middle. While people love to make fun of the recliners in domestic forward cabins in the United States, they are an upgrade over the European standard.
I assigned myself 2C. As boarding slowed, the Aegean crew quickly welcomed us aboard and offered orange juice, sparkling wine, and water (served in real glassware).
The seats offered USB-A ports, which while not a full outlet, is great to have, but somewhat outdated with the move towards USB-C.
It’s also not guaranteed on short-haul flights in Europe, even on mainline carriers. While the extra space of an empty middle was nice, I hate how some airlines put a tray in. It would be nice to be able to lift the armrest and be able to spread out (as you can on British Airways Club Europe).
There was a card in the seat pocket advertising wifi and what’s available on the portal.
It was cool to see Aegean offer 10 minutes of free connectivity onboard. While a few carriers make wifi free in premium cabins and others are aiming to make wifi free for everyone, it’s nice that Aegean gives everyone a few minutes free.
Unfortunately, the wifi was not working on this flight, so I couldn’t test the connectivity. Most of the flight was over the Mediterranean, so I can’t say I’m too surprised that wifi was not working.
Aegean distributed paper menus that were printed in English and Greek. Despite the destination being Israel, they did not have menus in Hebrew.
I was impressed by the 3-page paper menu for such a quick flight. And while US carriers have European carriers beat in terms of the seat, European carriers usually beat on service and soft product in Euro-business.
I liked that there were 2 hot entrees available to choose from. Both, however, were animal protein so if you are vegetarian or vegan, I would recommend packing your own food or ordering a special meal. The 4 wines were all Greek or from the region, a local touch I liked.
There was an extensive drinks selection of soda, coffees, teas, beers, and spirits. Having espresso drinks on board is also a nice touch of European carriers. I wish US carriers had espresso on board short-haul flights.
Based on my pre-flight research, I determined Aegean uses Stogel for their kosher meals out of Athens. My general experience with Stogel is that the food is not great, so I did not order a kosher meal ahead of time. I took a picture of the base tray set up from my seatmate, but nothing else from the service. My seatmate reported that they enjoyed the food.
I self-catered, and just ordered some beverages.
The crew very were friendly and checked back to top up beverages. As it was a quick flight, the service wrapped up pretty fast, and I passed the time till landing by reading. I did dip into the forward lavatory, which was pretty tight, but nicely appointed.
When we landed, we didn’t spend too long taxiing before deplaning at a gate. Unfortunately, Israel does not offer fast-track immigration for premium passengers and waits can be quite lengthy. However, I was lucky to have a relatively quick queue and the wait for my bag wasn’t too long once I was through.
Given the tight security entering Israel, I did not take any photos of the arrival experience in Israel.
Aegean offers a very solid business-class product, especially given that short-haul routes dominate its network. While a more premium seat would be appreciated, the friendly crew, paper menus, and meals served on real glass and china gave the overall experience a premium feel. While Athens isn’t a major connecting hub, I would not hesitate to fly Aegean in the future.

Entry 150. Athens, GreeceThursday, April 20
After some seriously rocky adventures on Kefalonia, I was kind of looking forward to heading back to big-city civilisation. The Greek islands have great potential but they can be quite hard work, especially so if you visit outside of high season.
To be honest I felt the least welcome of any place on my travels whilst being in these islands because of grumpy locals, over-priced food and accommodation, difficulty in getting places and the slapstick level of service.
Maybe it’s a Greek thing, maybe it’s just that they’re sick of tourists because we’ve been coming here for thousands of years. Whatever. All that has resulted in collective fatigue which means I’m in less than an optimum condition to write this entry about Athens, which needs to cover many weird, wonderful and important things. I hope I do it justice, so please bear with me.

This is the 5th article in the series — a collaboration between Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB). Previous articles mapped property ownership-related patterns in Copenhagen, Prague, and Lisbon. In this post, we turn our attention to Athens, identifying parallels with Lisbon in how the city’s land management, ownership and built environment patterns were shaped in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
Like Lisbon, Athens together with its greater public interest have been significantly impacted by the Troika loan conditions, weak regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable groups, and a lack of data transparency in land and property ownership registers, although this is now being addressed through efforts to digitise the national cadaster.
This blog supports the argument that municipalities and state governments, just as the large developers and investment companies, play an active role in neoliberal city and country development logics leading to privatisation and financialization of the public real estate assets. It also argues that the European city and national governments should play a much stronger role in promoting spatial justice and societal resilience through land management rather than using it as a mere tool for profit and public debt repayment.
Athens has become the second least liveable city in Europe, according to a recent report “On the quality of life in European cities, 2023”, published by the European Commission. The reasons are similar to the issues and patterns observed in Lisbon, which largely resulted in the increasing unaffordability and ever-increasing spatial exclusion of its citizens.
Acquiring, analysing and visualising data on land ownership can be a powerful tool in comprehending the past, and current built environment justice patterns and their socio-spatial intricacies. In Athens, due to a lack of data access and transparency, despite numerous efforts, it has been challenging to precisely assess and depict who owns land and property in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions that could bring actors in power into the public eye.
We have therefore taken a desk research approach to finding data on major landowners and significant land sales conducted in the past decade, contextualising them within Athens’ housing landscape and reflecting on their relationship with the city’s future transition strategies.
The blog is therefore structured as follows:
A) Largest landowners
B) Major Land Sales
C) Forces at Play
B) Athens’ housing issues
D) Data transparency review — National Property Registry
E) Concluding reflections — Future city transition

2. Athens Municipality: The city of Athens itself owns a large portion of public spaces, including parks, squares, infrastructural land and municipal buildings (Athens Social Atlas)
3. Greek Orthodox Church: Holds substantial real estate, including historic churches, monasteries, and other religious properties, as well as land that has been bequeathed to the Church over centuries. (See: Reuters, Athens Social Atlas)
2. Foreign Investment Funds: Over the past two decades, several international investment funds have purchased property in Athens, to capitalise on the low real estate prices that followed the financial crisis. This includes hedge funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have acquired properties, especially in tourist-heavy areas or neighbourhoods undergoing redevelopment.
In the past decade, Athens has seen several major land sales as part of a broader wave of real estate activity, subsequent privatisation efforts, and international interest in Greece. Below are some of the most significant land sales based on land size and estimated market value, taking into account location (prime or less-developed areas), demand (tourism, logistics, residential), and strategic importance (e.g., port facilities, large urban developments).
Hellinikon Project (former Athens Airport)
Astir Palace Resort (Vouliagmeni Peninsula)
Piraeus Port Authority (PPA)
Marina Zea (Piraeus)
The sale of public land in Greece, facilitated by the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), has been a major source of societal outcry, particularly in the wake of the country’s sovereign debt crisis (2009–2010).
As part of the bailout agreements imposed by the Troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), Greece was pressured to privatise public land and assets, a move critics argue significantly weakened the state both politically and economically. This privatisation agenda, which often disregarded national social needs, was aimed at settling debt by selling off strategic assets such as airports, ports, and vast tracts of land. Projects like the Hellinikon redevelopment, where public land is being transformed into private luxury developments, have marginalised lower-income residents and reduced public access to urban and coastal areas. Local communities, environmental organisations, and political opposition have strongly resisted these sales, especially of large coastal sites like Ellinikon, which includes the former Athens airport and Agios Kosmas beach, arguing that the privatisations prioritise elite interests over broader public needs.
Politically, the HRADF’s operations have been highly controversial, with opponents dubbing it the “Sell-out Fund of Greece” and questioning the constitutionality of its mandate. Additionally, the low sale prices of assets, such as Lamda Development’s acquisition of Hellinikon for a fraction of its real value, have intensified public resentment, with many viewing these transactions as a fire sale of national treasures.
As noted in the Athens Social Atlas article, the privatisation programme fits into a long history of public land abuse and illegal seizures. This includes everything from individuals and companies encroaching on public land for private purposes to large-scale speculative developments by private enterprises. What is more, in some cases, this also relates to the opposite scenarios when privately owned land has been taken over by the state. The absence of a transparent National Land Registry, coupled with a fragmented bureaucracy, has facilitated large-scale exploitation and commodification of public assets.
The great article from Athens Social Atlas (2015), by renowned scholar and economic geographer Costis Hadjimichalis summarises some of the dynamics that shape the land seizures in Attica. He also writes that:
“The main reason for land-related abuses and illegal activities, but also for the delays in privatisation and sell-off by the HRADF, is the lack of a National Land Register. Essentially, due to a variety of factors, the state is not fully aware of the actual size and location of its real estate assets. Other than the lack of a land register, other important factors are the fragmentation of public services dealing with public land, the weakness or indifference of civil servants and the combination of political expedience and corruption.”
The recent development of a national land register provides some hope for a more informed and democratic decision process in terms of land management. However, while HRADF records its most profitable year, the rhetoric remains the same: “With a record contribution to the public funds as well as to the development course of the country, it seems that the operation of the TAIPED will be completed, and by the end of the year it will be absorbed by the Superfund” and “In total, the revenue from concessions — privatisations this year — will, for the first time in the history of the Fund — exceed 4 billion euros , an amount that will be automatically directed to the repayment of a not inconsiderable part of the public debt, contributing to its reduction by almost two percentage points of GDP“. This year alone, Greece hopes to raise more than 5 billion euros in 2024 from the sale of state assets, including a stake in Athens International Airport and concession deals for two toll roads, a senior privatisation official said on Wednesday — the privatisation logic continues. What has changed are add-ons such as “Decarbonisation Fund” and ESG compliance, with the support of the largest consulting firms.
To understand some of the further reasons behind the present spatial injustice issues in the Athens Metropolitan Area, one has to further examine the forces that came into play, prior to and following the financial crisis, as well as the enabling policies and regulatory mechanisms that facilitated their enforcement. These include:
Sources: (Law 2778/1999), (Law 4646/2019), (Law 4714/2020 — Article 5B), Law 4242/2014, Laws 4242/2014 and 4373/2016), (Law 5006/2022),
1. Housing financialisation a la Griega” — Alexandri, 2022
2. Social justice and a city: surplus capital and the remaking of Athens
3. Housing Crisis and Neoliberal Social policy in Greece
4. “​Platform — driven housing commodification, financialisation and gentrification in Athens
The dynamics described above led to multiple urban socio-spatial problems. Eteron — the Institute for Research and Social Change — a non-profit organisation working towards the production of knowledge and citizen empowerment through its
Project Housing360
provides an impactful overview of the present housing problems in Greece.
Property ownership in Greece is fragmented and often difficult to track accurately. This is partly due to incomplete land records and inheritance processes, outdated property registries, and legal complexity. The creation of a comprehensive, unified land registry system, the National Property Registry, also known as ‘Ktimatologio’, has been a laborious process spanning over three decades.
Before the establishment of the Ktimatologio, property records were managed by ‘Ypothikofylakeia’ (Mortgage Registries), which were responsible for recording legal documents related to property transactions, such as mortgages, deeds, and other encumbrances. As the Ktimatologio gradually expands, it is replacing the Ypothikofylakeia. In areas where the Ktimatologio is fully operational, the Ypothikofylakeio is either phased out or its role is significantly reduced. However, in areas where the Ktimatologio is not yet implemented, the Ypothikofylakeio continues to function as the primary land registry. Presently, the Greek government expresses optimism regarding the Ktimatologio project’s culmination by the year 2026.
An interactive digital map, with all properties currently incorporated into the registry, has been recently released, accompanied by the number for each plot. In adherence to data protection protocols, under both national law and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ownership details will remain undisclosed within the map.
To uncover ownership information, Greek Law permits anyone invoking “legitimate interest” to apply for information held in the land registry, which is provided by the Land Registrar in the form of a certificate or excerpt of the Land Book” (ELRA) — therefore the information can be considered public in the sense that anyone can have access to it. Each property is marked with a unique number, the so-called Code Number E of the national K thematic catalogue (KAEK), which is the exclusive code number for each parcel of land, the identity of the property. The interactive digital map represents the first time that each plot’s code is publicly available. One can purchase different types of information upon registration through a Greek digital system Taxisnet for residents with Tax registration number.
As this is a work in progress, property holders are still having the liberty to register their properties and update information conveniently, eliminating the need for physical visits to government agencies with supporting documentation. Though the deadline for property registration has lapsed, the online map aims to serve as an incentive for registration, ideally before November 30th, 2024.
After analysing Copenhagen, Prague, Lisbon, and Athens, it is clear that European States have followed certain common patterns in land management and real estate development. The role of the state and municipalities, often perceived as passive guardians of public interests against large private investors, has shifted towards active promoters of privatisation. Publicly owned development companies, such as Copenhagen’s City and Port Corporation or Greece’s TAIPED (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund), are increasingly used to stimulate economic growth and repay debt — whether infrastructure-related as in Copenhagen or tied to Greece’s financial crisis.
This system inherently incentivises the maximisation of returns on investments, often through the sale and development of public land into high-value, luxury projects. This approach prioritises short-term financial gains and large-scale developments, with little room for smaller, complex, or low-return projects, such as providing or retrofitting affordable housing.
While balance sheets may look strong, with institutions like HRADF showing greater financial returns, the reality is that profits are privatised, while the risks and losses are borne by society at large.
This raises the questions:

In the heart of Pangrati, I found myself surrendering to the most unlikely companions: the yiayias and their trusty shopping carts.
It was a tale not of streets but of wheels, where the clatter of metal on cobblestone became my guide through the labyrinthine charm of Athens. Each yiayia, with her cart in tow, was a living, breathing cartographer, mapping out the intricate routes to the neighborhood’s most popular pop-up.
I ditched the digital predictability of Google Maps and became an unwitting disciple of these cart-wielding mavens.
The market, when finally unveiled, was a testament to the wisdom of following the clatter and the charm of navigating life with a shopping cart as a trusted sidekick. The cart wasn’t just a means of transport; it was a companion, a confidant, and a symbol of gastronomic acumen. The locals, weathered and wise, shared amused glances as I, the outsider, fell in step with the cart procession.
In the gritty underbelly of Athens, the local market is a sensory onslaught. As you navigate through weathered…

Athens, Greece, January, 3rd 2023.
Yesterday, as a deceptively serene January sun shone on one of those poorly built streets of Athens, most likely hastily rebuilt after an earthquake, I found myself walking from the Acropolis to my hotel to interview Marlena for my podcast Stories of Healing.
On a side street of the bustling city, a man was standing on the sidewalk while another attempted to inject drugs directly into one of his neck’s arteries with a syringe. This unexpected encounter hit me hard. The compassionate teachings from the documentary The Wisdom of Trauma flooded my mind. I couldn’t help but wonder about the lives of these two men: Do they have families? Homes? How do they survive amidst such despair? The contrast between the seemingly timeless ruins and the rawness of the present was stark. The Greek government’s efforts to preserve its ancient heritage seemed unbefitting. Those marble stones will eventually come to dust without suffering, while this man was escaping his immediate pain the best way he knew how.
As I continued my walk back to this tiny hotel room, I struggled to find my inner peace, still bewildered. I focused on my body, straightening my shoulders and grounding myself. The city’s sounds faded into the background. Gradually, a sense of belonging washed over me, reminding me of the gratitude I have been feeling since I started nomading and that home is within me.
The interview with Marlena went well despite a few technical and practical hiccups. I pondered whether in-person interviews would be much better, with the added presence and access to more of someone’s body language and emotions. It was my first remote interview, my second interview ever, and I felt no stage fear; it was so natural. Marlena, being the sharp, vulnerable, and endearing woman she is, surely helped. She notably talks about drinking starting at four and those seven seconds of bliss.
I received an encouraging response about a housesitting opportunity in the South of Cyprus from January 18 to 28. The island has been divided since the Turkish invasion in the 1970s. Google Maps indicates a strange zone, a buffer of some sort, between the North and South sides. The red lines for borders I am used to seeing around countries are not there. And I wonder how someone at Google decides to delineate territories of contested land; it must become a geopolitical statement and one with practical consequences for a traveler like me: I am not sure I can cross from the North to the South; I may have to fly or take a boat directly to the South.
In recent months, I’ve struggled with short-term memory issues, but they seem to be fading. My friend Matei, whom I have known since high school and who has been traveling with me for the last few days, hasn’t noticed any lapses. We will go to Mount Athos together, that strange land where women can’t enter-the last one on earth.

Athens is the birthplace of our civilisation. The origin of our democracy and cultural hotspot for philosophers and artists. Athens. A place where creativity stands above money. A vibrant hub between the middle east and Europe. A place where people enjoy living.
No matter if you visit for a day, over the weekend or you take your time to explore the city, make sure you see one of its hidden gems and exceptional cultural sights.
But first things, first. Due to Covid-19 a stay at a designated hotel and a negative test followed by a 7 days quarantine was required to enter Greece. In case of a positive test a supervised 14 days stay has been necessary. Since June 15th Greece restrictions have been eased and Greece has reopened its doors for international travel. In the bridge phase till 30th of June guests from risk areas are tested at a designated hotel — again followed by either 7 or 14 days of quarantine. All other tourists undertake random tests upon arrival. From July 1st onwards the rules will be somewhat relaxed. Find more information here. With 190 recorded deaths, Greece has a comparatively low Covid-19 rate — one of the best in Europe.
Ok, now that you know about the common rules, let me tell you why my heart fully opens up when in Athens.
Come with me and I´ll show you my way of exploring Athens — where south african parrots guide you through the National Garden to the small streets of Anafiotika — sit down, relax, have a greek coffee and enjoy the sun. Discover incredibly creative Graffiti’s on your way to Acropolis. The view is breathtaking. Feel the oriental influence at the bazaars around Thissio and check out the Varvakios food market. Taste the rich flavours of greek vegetables and fruits and try a huge variety of olives. Grab a taxi to Piraeus and be part of the chaotic streets of Athens, take the next ferry to a pine covered sunny island and breathe.
This little walk through Athens should get you inspired. Wanna explore more ? In the following lines I will reveal my little secrets and talk about the must sees. Let’s start with my favourite cultural sights.
Besides the typical let´s say more touristy things, let me tell you about a few other spots that I love to visit in Athens, like the Varvakios market, the Stavros Niarchos foundation or the Filopappou hill.
Since 1884 the so-called Dimotikí Agorá Athinón or as the locals call it Varvákios market has opened its doors from Monday to Saturday for everyone who loves fresh local food. Immerse into a world of smells and tastes between Europe and the Orient. Let me guide you through the market hall and follow me on a short walk between fruit & vegetable stands to have lunch in a simple greek taverna.
Skinned goats hanging upside down, a cowhead staring at you, fishrow on ice, a smell of slightly old blood and a marketer screaming at you in a hall filled with active hustle. Doesn’t sound too inviting ? Well, that’s reality here. The market hall shows authenticity to its fullest and gives you a throwback to how it must have been 100 years ago. You won’t find neatly packed beef filets here, prepared fish carpaccio or beautified little packages of ham. It’s raw, it’s rough and it’s real.
What an experience ! Let’s continue our walk to the vegetarian area of the market that extends alongside the square. You´ll find a variety of local and seasonal fruits in the brightest colours and best qualities — varying according to the season. In between you´ll find stands that offer oriental spices and all kinds of nuts, dry fruits and herbs in bulk. So make sure you have some bags with you and fill them with whatever attracts you most.
After seeing all this delicious food, you´ll be hungry for sure. Enjoy a variety of greek specialities on small plates and share with your friends or family in one of my favourite restaurants — it’s so local that not even google finds it — sorry ;).
From raw, rough and real to amazing architecture & art. The Stavros Niarchos foundation is an organisation that makes grants in the areas of arts and culture, education, health and medicine, and social welfare that solely derived from sales of fossil fuels, as Niarchos was one of world’s largest transporters of oil. Granting $860 million in 2017 the Stavros Niarchos cultural center designed by the renowned architect Renzo Piano opened its doors to the public.
This modern monument includes the national library of Greece and the Greek national opera. A meeting point for everyone who wants to experience breathtaking views, state of the art architecture and enjoy the new greek culture. Inspired by the natural greek flora and fauna the surrounding parks are full of lavender, rosemary and olive trees. A fountain accompanied by classical musical played every hour leads to a path towards the sea.
From classical music to the highest of all goods: nature. From the lively streets of Athens to a tranquille refuge. From marble ground to solid earth. The Filopappou hill is one of my favourite places and for sure one of the most beautiful spots of Athens.
Breathtaking views to the Acropolis, Athens mountains and the sea. Sit on an olive tree and enjoy this unique experience with a bottle of greek red wine.
From one of my favourite places to the unconventional areas I love the most in Athens — from Anafiotika, a village-like neighbourhood next to Acropolis, to Exarchia, the center of anarchism to Omonia, an area to be developed. Let yourself be surprised by the variety and distinctiveness of Athens.
Anafiotika is a scenic tiny neighborhood, a tranquil oasis in the bustling heart of downtown Athens. Narrow passageways filled with small houses, bright colors & plants immediately bring you into a relaxed island mood. The village’s name “Anafiotika” means “little Anafi” and is dedicated to its first inhabitants’ home island. They came to Athens in order to work as construction workers in the refurbishment of King Othon’s Palace.
Meet Exarchia ! The most controversial, the most colorful, the most alternative neighborhood in Athens. This area is a creative and lively art hub renowned for being the historical core of intellectual activism. You can find a lot of restaurants & bars mainly located on Stournari street, also called the Greek Silicon Valley. The National Technical University is as well located in Stournari street and among the oldest higher education institutions of Greece — the most prestigious among engineering schools.
Exarcheia has always attracted exceptional Greek and foreign intellectuals, who lived and worked in the area. The alternative and artistic atmosphere is encapsulated in every corner, every wall, and every individual of this unique neighborhood. Famous (and not only) graffiti artists have left their mark and expressed their message for a more equal world.
Omonoia means concord. It is one of the most historical areas in the center of Athens. In recent years, it has raised a lot of interest from investors abroad, as there are hidden gems of unrenovated apartments in amazingly central locations.
The brand new fountain in times of Covid-19 lifted the spirits of the residents and upgraded the whole area. Further projects like re-think Athens show the start of a movement towards a sustainable Greece.
And after a long day in the bustling heart of Athens — it´s time for some drinks.
One thing is sure — Greeks know how to enjoy life. Their open mentality and willingness to celebrate where and whenever they feel like, is like no other. Here are a few bars that I really like and that I can recommend to anyone who wants to have a fun night out.
heteroclito is an one of a kind wine destination in the historic center of Athens. It´s a small place with a great selection of mostly local and organic wines.
Noel, a magical place. Crazily exaggerated christmas decor, vintage furniture and baroque elements inspired by Cuba, Paris and New York, all mixed up. A big melting pot, always crowded and excellent service.
TAF is an innovative cultural platform, that shows artworks ranging from contemporary, performances, film screenings, roundtable discussions and workshops to music projects, works-in-progress and pop-up projects.
Couleur Locale is a hidden gem in the narrow streets of Monastiraki. Enjoy a stunning Acropolis view and well-mixed cocktails.
The warmth of the greek people, delicious food, the sea and the sun. What more could you ask for ? No matter if on a cultural level or when it comes to taking a break — Greece offers hospitality at its highest level. After this little intro you tasted, heard, smelled, saw and felt Athens with all its beauty and authenticity. So, what holds you back ? Book your trip to Athens and enjoy Greece with all senses.

3 Reasons why I can’t wait to go!
Finally, after much umming and ahhing, pro-ing and con-ing; we have arrived at a winner…
Athens! (if you couldn’t tell by the title and image).
As I stated in my January writing prompt:
medium.com
I was struggling to decide between two ancient powerhouses:
In the red corner, we had Rome. With its beautiful renaissance architecture and awe-inspiring ancient monuments and history. A proud city, with a distinct culture and cuisine.
And in the blue corner, we had Athens. The city that founded democracy, and home of the famous Acropolis. A gritty sprawling mass of brick and concrete, spilt into the Mediterranean Sea, filled to the brim with character and delicious food.
After a hard-fought battle, Athens got its hand raised via a split-decision victory (Athens is a little easier on the wallet).

Carolina: The aftermath of Day 1 was a 12:25hrs sleep. Yes, you read that right, over twelve hours, and guess what? Even after all that sleep, we still woke up feeling like crap. Sorry, Mom, you're not gonna like hearing this but we were both under the weather. No fever but definitely feeling very much out of it, headache, body ache, sore throat, you name it.
Because of that, and because at this point it was 2pm local time, we decided to take it slow. First, we went out to scout some freshly baked bread. We found this bakery that was just a short walk from our Airbnb. Back home, we then cooked ourselves a simple breakfast: 2 eggs and 2 slices of fresh bread toasted in a panini press.
Two DayQuils after, decided that even though we weren't feeling up for the Acropolis, we wanted to do another museum instead. So we made our way to the Acropolis Museum, stopping on the way for some coffee of course.
Will: A broken cash register and a generous Grecian coffee shop owner yielded two free croissants filled with pistachio cream (I enjoyed those for dessert later as they were very much not vegan).
With a cup of coffee in hand, we proceeded to walk up one of the main streets in our neighborhood — Veikou. I kept telling Will how much it reminded me of home. For those who have been in Rio, it looks somewhere between Copacabana and Downtown Rio. There are tons of shops of all kinds everywhere. Camera stores, pharmacies, bakeries, restaurants, cafés, retail, home goods, you name it. You can literally get everything done within a 5 min walk radius.
Another thing that's very prominent in the neighborhoods of Athens is the graffiti. Not the art kind, but the tags (pt: pichagem). It's everywhere you look. It's a bit intimidating at first but it's a very safe neighborhood, mainly elders and a few tourists here and there. Pretty calm overall.
The Acropolis Museum is a gorgeous and modern building. At first glance, it looks like it could be a modern art museum.
The museum was built on top of the ruins of the ancient city of Athens. Underneath it, you can walk around an archeological site with signs explaining what each ruin used to be — a bathhouse, a mansion, workshops... We were the most impressed with how the ancient Greek civilization had a somewhat complex plumbing system with legit pipes and all (keep in mind that this is from the 8th to 5th cent. BC).
Above, in the museum itself, is a gorgeous collection of artifacts from the Acropolis itself and its slopes. They also have a very interesting video on the Persian destruction of the Acropolis in 480 BC and an explanation of how pigments were created using local rocks/minerals (see photo below) — yes, all the ancient Greek sculptures that we know now to be on white marble used to be colored.
After the museum, we went back home, cooked some dinner, and began our work day.

Before we set off to the Greek Islands for 8 days, we had 2 full days to explore Athens, the ancient capitol of Greece.
We arrived in the late afternoon on a miraculously on-time plane from London. After getting our bags we bought a ‘Tourist Ticket’ from the metro station. This ticket includes return to and from the airport and unlimited use of the Athens public transport system. It cost €22 although we didn’t end up using the metro much. Everywhere we wanted to visit was generally walkable. We used it 3 times in total. A simple return ticket for the airport will only cost €14, and if you’re only staying in the city centre for a few days you’ll probably be fine.
We stayed in an Airbnb in Plaka near the Akropoli metro station less than a 5-minute walk to the south entrance of the Acropolis itself. From here, we could get everywhere in the city centre in less than 20 minutes of walking. The centre itself is dense and full of incredible restaurants, historic sights, museums and shops.
Our host, Giannas, welcomed us to Greece with a shot of Ouzo and some recommendations on what to do in the area. We soon learned that Plaka itself is very much catered to tourists. Whilst very beautiful to explore, we couldn’t help but feel it was all just a big show for tourists. Giannas recommended the Monastiraki area for restaurants and nightlife. Our walking tour guide, Michael, echoed these same thoughts, claiming that no Greek people eat food in Plaka!
Good to know in retrospect, and painfully obvious when strolling through and all you see is touristy shops and restaurants. Although the proximity to the Acropolis was excellent and the area was quiet in the evenings. Everything being in walking distance meant it never became an issue.
We started the day bright and early with a walking tour with Athens Free Walking Tour. When travelling to a big city like Athens, a great way to get a feel for the layout, vibe and culture is to take a walking tour. Across Europe there are walking tours for all budgets. Based on experience, the free ones I have done have all been incredibly useful. Nowadays, they’re an essential part of visiting a new city for us.
Before setting on our way we grabbed a couple of macchiatos from the Coffee Island that was nearby.
We want to avoid spoiling all of the surprises of the tour and just give an idea of what you will be doing and seeing:
Our guide, Michael, was very well educated in ancient history and has a deep knowledge and understanding of Athens.
The tour lasted a little under 3 hours and finished in Monastiraki. We took one of Michael’s food recommendations and had an incredible lunch at O Thanasis. The moussaka we had there was the best we had during our time in Greece.
The Central Market is a noisy and bustling fresh produce market. The main hall sells meat and seafood whilst the surrounding area sells vegetables, herbs and spices.
We arrived in the early afternoon. There was still a lot of activity with plenty of sellers around. The seller’s area feels like a relic of the past and not the kind of thing you’ll see in a central part of a modern city. This authentic and local feel really adds to its charm.
Even if you’re not buying, wandering through the market is an experience for the eyes and nose. Although, if you’re a vegetarian or turned off by the smell of meat you may want to skip this place.
The Acropolis Museum is dedicated to the archaeological discoveries from the Acropolis. It can be a good idea to visit here first before going to the Acropolis itself. But either order works.
This sleek, modern building first opened in 2009 and was a welcome respite for us by the blaring summer heat. Close to 4,000 objects are on display here and there are great views of the city from the restaurant terrace.
Entrance only costs €5 and is a great stop for a couple of hours. If you can, hire a guide and you will get so much more out of it!
After some much needed afternoon rest from a packed day of sight-seeing we headed out to Cinque. This is a place to bring your loved one, sip on some divine wine and talk about your experiences of the day.
We sampled a bunch of different wines and shared a meat platter together. The owner explained the origins and optimal tasting experience of each wine we tried. We aren’t serious wine drinkers but I imagine a wine fanatic would get a lot out of this place!
The staff were cheery and helpful, and our names were printed out and placed in a frame for our table when we arrived. These little details are what makes a night at Cinque an unforgettable experience.
We recommend booking beforehand as it’s a very popular place. We got lucky and managed to secure a booking on the day.
Our day was planned around visiting the Acropolis in the afternoon. This was to avoid the mass of crowds and hot weather. We also didn’t want to get burnt out on ancient sites and monuments beforehand.
We both love Greek food and wanted to sample as much of the local food as possible. What better place to do that than Athens? We hastily researched where we should eat and put together a list.
First stop was O Kostas to try the best souvlaki in Athens. Or so they claim. O Kostas is a family run business that has been around for over 65 years. They serve a simple, old fashioned style of souvlaki for €2 each. An absolute bargain.
We both went for pork and devoured it quickly. It was delicious. We could have easily had several more! We had to leave some room for the other food stops though so it was off to get some coffee next.
The unusual name of this cafe stood out to us and good things happen when you combine art and coffee. This stylish spot was full of Greek people of all ages enjoying a chat and coffee. We ordered a couple of iced coffees from here as that seemed to be what was popular.
The coffees were fine. The space itself, however, seems to be the main draw. It feels hidden away and makes a great escape from the chaos outside.
Next up was sampling some Greek style pastries at Bougatsadiko Thessaloniki. The pastries are known locally as Bougatsa. We tried spinach and feta cheese and minced meat. Both were amazing and started our love affair with these pastries.
They’re a common breakfast meal and we had them often during our stay in Greece.
To put it simply, visiting The Acropolis is an absolute must-do whilst in Athens. In the summer months it can get extremely busy, like most of the big ticket sites across Europe. We were advised to visit in the early afternoon, as the mornings tend to be busier and by then the big crowds have finished up and left to eat lunch.
Another tip we came across was entering via the south entrance, which is closer to the Akropoli metro station and Acropolis Museum. This entrance tends to be much quieter than the main one. We lined up for less than 5 minutes to get our tickets here.
One of the best parts about visiting are the smaller temples and sites you can explore as you ascend to the top, where the visually iconic Parthenon rests. You also get great views of the city.
Our last stop for the day was the Thision Open Air Cinema. Located near the Acropolis, this retro cinema has a lot of charm and ended up being one of our fondest memories of Athens. It was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of exploring.
Tickets are well priced and so is the popcorn (and other snacks) and alcohol. There is an intermission during the middle of the film where you can stock up again also. All of this while you sit under the stars with the Acropolis in the background.
Visiting in the evening is essential, and we imagine it would get quite chilly outside the summer months.
After the movie we went back to our Airbnb for some much needed rest. We had an 8am flight the next morning to head south towards Milos, a beautiful island famous for its rocky landscape.

Whenever I travel, I pack my running gear. Partially because I might be training for an upcoming race, but also because there are few better ways to get a true feel for a town.
Running between different places gives you a more accurate feel for scale and distances, something you do not get from travelling by Metro or cab. The Metro makes short distances longer and convoluted, whilst taxis tend to take you through bigger roads, creating a barrier between other people, the terrain, and even the smells.
I enjoyed many things in Athens, from the scenery to the food, but to be fully transparent, the traffic and air pollution were quite off-putting at the beginning. I nearly convinced myself it was a bad idea to go for a run. Aside from the car fumes, we’d barely seen a single jogger on our first day there.
But looking at the map, I noticed there were several large green spaces with fairly little distance between them. So I created an itinerary starting from where we were staying and covering four of the major points of interest, whilst mostly staying off the busy road.
It is worth noting that many of the smaller streets are seldom used by cars, making them much more pleasant than the pavement on the bigger roads. That being said, the pavement is narrow at the best of times and full of obstacles, from holes, steps, parked vehicles, and cats!
Depending on where you are staying, you will need to adapt the itinerary. But wherever you start from, you can keep the general principles and loop through the various sites.
I first started with a large hill close to where I was staying. It is known as Nymph Hill, Pnyx Hill, or Lofos Philopappou depending on which side you are on (at least that’s what I was told). It is about 75 hectares and provides numerous trails partially shaded by pine trees. At the top, you will find the antique ruins of the Prison of Socrates, the Philopappos Monument, and numerous unobstructed viewing points of the Acropolis.
The national observatory is located on the northern side of the park, although I only realised this when spotting the old Doridis National Observatorium from the height of the Acropolis. This side of the hill is also host to the Pnyx Monument. It would be quite easy to complete a 5km run just by exploring the different paths available and going around to see the numerous points of interest.
From there, you can reach the Acropolis in just a few minutes, and run around it mostly on pedestrian streets. At this point, you might want to stop for a quick look at the nicely renovated Odeon of Herodes Amphitheatre situated on the south side, which is accessible without a ticket.
As a next stop, I aimed for the Lycabettus Hill viewing point, which towers over the capital at an altitude of 277m. To reach it from the Acropolis, there is no other way than going across through Plaka, where small streets are busy with shops and tourists, but few cars, at least until you reach the Leof Vasilisis Amaliasthe, which is the busiest avenue. On the other side, you can check the Monument to the Unknown Soldier before going back to smaller streets. At that point, you will have to slow down as the slope gets very steep and the run up zigzags through arid-looking cactus vegetation. It is a breathtaking climb, both physically and metaphorically.
My final stop was the Panathenaic Stadium, which is the only marble stadium in the world. You will need a ticket to get inside and I didn’t have too much time left at that point, but would have liked to run a few laps inside this majestic monument of a stadium.
On my way back, I went for a meander in the Ethnikos Kipos — Athens National Garden. The well-maintained paths are easier than the gravel trail on the hills, and it is worth noting that those gardens are flat as opposed to all previous sites quoted above. Even if you avoid climbing up the Lycabettus Hill, there is no avoiding slopes and stairs when running across Athens. Even though I paused many times to take pictures, I still felt the heaviness in my legs the next day, having totalled nearly 500m of ascent!
One final thought is about the temperature. I visited Athens in November, which was very pleasant and perfect for a run during the day. I know from friends that the heat during the summer is quite unbearable and you would probably have to time your running tour in the early morning hours to escape the beating sun.
Overall, it was a delightful 15km run, which could have been more effective had I not gotten lost a few times. But that was also part of the experience!
My only regret is not having had the opportunity to run the original 42km from Marathon to Athens, which would have been a cherry on this tourist cake. No doubt I will be back for that!

When I was moving out and selling as much as possible someone came to my apartment to buy my old mattress. On their way out they saw the two photographs I’d printed and mounted on the wall. They asked about buying them and I decided to give them the one of Saratoga beach. The brush of pastels spread across a sunset beach had given colour to an otherwise empty apartment. It was time to move on. Giving away my DIY print was a great ending for something I can no longer retain. The other print, of Yuki at a pagoda in Japan, didn’t seem appropriate to give away and so I threw it out — a symbolic guesture to move out and move on.
I’ve come to Athens on a class trip with ten other students and my studio professor. We are here as tourists but also researchers, seeking to understand the architecture and archeology of the city and islands in the Agean.
On the first day we walked around the the Archaeological Site of Kerameikos. This was the first of many walking days to other ancient ruins including the Roman forum, Hadrians library, Ancient Agora, temple of Zeus and Aristotle’s school. Many of them are ruins with little remaining but help to understand the history of the city. Since we were travelling as an architecture class, our focus was largely on the building ruins and urbanism.
One of the most interesting walks was on the first day when we visited Philopappos Hill across from the acropolis. In the 50s an architect by the name of Dimitris Pikionis oversaw the construction of roads and pathways that transformed the landscape from a visual experience to one that included the tactile roughness of old stones collected from the city. He salvaged marble slabs and reused them as paving stones to make pathways. This got me thinking that I should explore walkscapes in my future architectural research and the ways different ground conditions affect the user experience. The ground and pathways played a small part in the book I self published and my thesis. This is an area I’d like to investigate further.
The path led to a reconstructed church and pavilion. At the time of construction the pavilion had a view of the acropolis but is now blocked by trees. Our professor was of the opinion that the way the pavilion connects views, landscape, and movement all together makes it one of the most important transformative works of modern architecture. I would agree that the pavilion is quite nice and impactful but I don’t know enough of its legacy to understand it’s significance.
As one ascends past the pavilion, various glimpses of the acropolis are visible between trees and bushes. The acropolis is always present and is beautiful. The pathway changed slowly from smooth slabs to rougher flagstones eventually reaching an open plaza and at the top a monument that was once a tomb. This was our first glimpse of the city from above but not the last.
The art of photography has in it emotions of the photographer. The past three years of graduate school have been largely framed as a period of self development and growth accelerated by an abrupt transition from partnered to solitary life. I see a clear personality in the lineage of my photography that I am keen to change. Now that I’m travelling alone I feel that it is appropriate to find a new way of looking at the world. I want to be different and see that in my photography. I want this new chapter to be transformation and evolution.
A year ago, I bought an extra wide camera lens for landscape photography and sold my stock lens that was no longer giving me sharp images. This purchase was a legacy of my previous perspective to frame open landscapes and wide vistas behind a solitary figure.
As this trip approached, I reassessed my desire to obtain a zoom lens thinking that zooming in would be a suitable way to alter my perspective. I couldn’t find a good deal on a used lens and was also busy with school. A week before my departure I was again looking for a specific camera lens and reading online that eBay would be a good place to get second hand lenses. At 2AM I purchased a lens from Japan that would arrive a few days before I left. I was concerned about it arriving late because I would be moving out of my apartment the day I departed. Unfortunately I did not read the listing properly because the lens was an a-mount SAL18135 and my camera needs an e-mount SEL18135. I didn’t expect a lens would be made with different mounts so I got the wrong lens.
During our time in Athens we also visited many museums including the acropolis museum, museum of contemporary art, and archeology museum. The acropolis museum was the most interesting because it was the first thing we did in Athens and the building was very modern. It had fragments of the acropolis arranged along an interior core the same size and dimension as the pantheon. Chunks of the ruin had been placed to give a semblance of the real thing up on the hill. As an introduction to the archeology we would see in the next few days, it was an excellent appetizer. Below the museum was an excavated neighbourhood.
The museum of contemporary art was interesting because there were provocative works that spoke to geopolitical issues, pain, and suffering. We we fortunate to have a guided tour by a curator and access to the roof that is normally closed to the public. This was a unique view of the city because there aren’t many buildings taller than theirs from which to see the rest of the city. It was also relatively close to the acropolis which has protected views.
While it can be difficult to imagine a world based on foundation ruins, it helped to hear stories and read history. The acropolis was as highlight well worth the early morning visit. Arriving at opening avoided the crowds and was under a softer sun that wasn’t as draining in terms of heat. The ruins were impressive because they are clearly visible from the city but up close the scale became larger than expected. In the past it would have been possible to walk within the ruins but that has been closed off and some kind of reconstruction work was underway.
The visit to the acropolis was complemented by a reading from the professor that I reread while sitting on a piece of marble at the acropolis. The reading described the entrance sequence and the arrangement of buildings forming an asymmetrical aesthetic perspective. After reading the article I was able to walk the space and assess it for myself. It is not entirely visible today because a large statue is missing and the pedestrian pathway was altered with a horrible slab of concrete but it is otherwise accurate and interesting.
For the modern urbansim, we visited the an urban park along the port coast that was made for the 2004 Athens Olympics by destroying an industrial area and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center by architect Renzo Piano which was a fantastic example of an urban park on a slope. Unforutnately the library was closed but the upper lighthouse lookout was open and was an interesting moment to see the port as well as the park.
Athens is a wonderful city. I’ve been continuously impressed by the kindness, generosity, and politeness of the people. Twice we went to restaurants where we unknowingly ordered the wrong thing and twice we were offered food on the house to compensate. The people have been patient and kind- an unexpected delight. As well, the platting has been fantastic and the food delicious. Many of our meals came with a shot or dessert to finish off. We’ve also eatten a lot of soulvaki and gelato. It feel like we didn’t go a day without a stop for gelato.
Two other very enjoyable moments were the climbing of Lycabettus hill and Lofos Strefi. The first is one of the most prestigeous hills that make up ancient Athens and is a fantastic lookout. We had some trouble as a group collecting at the bottom because we all came from different places and some were late so it was a scramble up the hill in time for sunset. The rush was worthwhile though because the view was beautiful. The path zigzags up to a restaurant and crowded lookout. Right below on the path though was a pleasant spot to take photos and watch the night creep over the city. I struggled to capture photos with the wide angle camera lens but enjoyed catching up with a friend as the sun set and the cityscape illuminated. Unfortunately we were not able to stay as long as we would have liked because the rest of our party was waiting for us for dinner.
Some days later I was on my own and went up Lofos Strefi which I suspect is an old marble quarry. This is another nearby hill that’s not as high. The view was interesting because I could see the acropolis and to my left was Lycabettus. On an overcast evening where the rain sprinkled, I enjoyed a moment of solitude to listen to music emanating from the trees below. For the time, I enjoyed being alone on the hill above a city of millions. I would later discover it to be a musician in a restaurant hidden behind a rock cropping and under a large tree.
I’ve struggled on this trip to frame my pictures. Part of the reason is that I’m not enjoying the super wide aspect of the 10–18mm lens I have. It is so wide that it visibly distorts the images requiring a lot of post cropping and because of that it looks artificial. It is also the conditions cities are not panoramic landscapes and a tighter crop is more desirable. On the other hand, it could be that these struggles are a reflection of the internal turmoil to perceive the world differently and to be different. Photography in some ways is confirming some of my personal turmoil.
While the cameras has been troublesome, the iPhone remains a dependable with a regular field of view and suitable perspective. It’s easy to use, light, quick to access and always with me. It doesn’t come as a surprise that most people are phone wielding tourists and dslrs are fewer and fewer. Some days I wonder if I should just leave my camera at home. For the blog and Instagram the iPhone is sufficient but I’m always hoping for a special moment that would be worthy of a large print.

Athens is an unequivocal dump.
I had illusions of Athens being similar to Thessaloniki, so I booked a ticket. Flying in from Corfu on New Years eve was an admittedly strange time to arrive. The airport was clean and modern, the rail connection to the city was descent. At this point I was mildly optimistic about visiting this city. Arriving in Syntagma square and heading a little north along big boulevards and then climbing slightly into a narrow grid network of streets, I found my accommodation.
After checking in to my accommodation. I watched the fireworks from the top of a nearby hill. Something that struck me from the ground level but was far more visible from above was the layer of smog enveloping the city. Pollution levels were on a par with other dirty cities like Sofia, Hanoi and Bangkok. However this is supposed to be a first world European country. I was expecting something more like Rome or Madrid, instead it reminded me more of the grimmy streets of Sofia and I felt I could even of been back in the chaotic streets of Hanoi or Bangkok again.
Immediately after setting out to explore the center on new year’s day, I encountered a large group of drug addicts who had gathered in the morning sun next to a classical building. I saw arms peppered with scars from injecting, others had needle in hand ready to use. As I walked on I quickly forgot the scene i’d just witnessed as I made it to towards Syntagma square in square. Admittedly I had an od impression of the city on Jan 1st as everything was closed and Greek people were at home. But I noticed another homeless drug addict sleeping on a bench in a narrow alley in the center. I was shocked to see his forearm covered in open wounds, it honestly looked like his arm was rotten. I was in such disbelief as to what I had just walked past that I went back to make sure that was indeed what I witnessed. What struck me about this scene was the respectable well dressed people walking past this man or standing just twenty meters away, but being totally oblivious to his plight.
In the subsequent days I walked around more and discovered Athens has a bustling bar and restaurant scene in the center. However outside the center the streets are a mess. Pavements barely exist so people walk in the street. All the streets seem to be coated in a layer of dirt, whether from pollution or something else I don’t know. I stayed in an airbnb where you have to raise and lower a metal security gate, like they have on shops when closed. “It’s to stop the anarchists damaging the building” the host said. In a society where anarchists are so mainstream, it suggests to me a lack of direction.
All in all I had a very bad impression of Athens. How can I enjoy the chaos of the city and the food when you have drug addicts and homeless people suffering horrifically in the center. And the Greek people acting with total indifference. Add on to that the cities dirty disorganised streets and thick atmosphere of pollution, I felt an overall seedy atmosphere. This overrided any quaintness from the neverending ramshackle nature of the shops.
One positive note I will end
on is the Greek peoples hospitality was very impressive as always, it’s just a shame Athens can’t be as impressive.

“Prosochí ton eptivon”. A message in Greek broke out through the intercom, pulling me out of my drowsy state. I checked the time. We were soon to land. I inferred I was listening to a seatbelt advisory. Having already fastened my seatbelt, moments later the English version came on confirming my intuition, announcing further that our descent into Athens had begun. I began pinching myself. I had been intermittently napping, but the adrenaline began coursing through me as I approached the land of my fore-bearers. I was arriving, but some part of me felt I was returning. Something was stirring within me.
Curious as to the plane’s relation to Athens I peered outside. Resting above the horizon was a bed of low hanging clouds. The plane was descending along with the sun, which casted an orange-peach hue over the bed of clouds. They were tipped with pink highlights. Fluffy like cotton candy. It was so peaceful. They were hovering over the dark blue ocean as if trying to hide the horizon. This scene mesmerized me. An island quickly faded from the view, supplanted by a mountainous coastline. Greece had already enchanted me with her beauty and I hadn’t even landed yet.
The intercom spoke once again, returning my attention to the cabin. I caught nothing. The phonology captivated me. It swayed itself to a rythm which enchanted me. Had my late papous, my greek grandfather, been beside me he could have translated the message for me. He would have won the hearts of the cabin crew members, by his charm and capacity to speak greek. He would have understood everything. He would be completly at ease. He could have taught me greek. I might have known just enough to impress a greek girl. I am sure that’s what he would have wanted for me. I chuckled.
I felt him near. I felt him almost beside me. I began to concentrate on the map of Greece, displayed on the screen in front of me. Particularly I focused on the Peloponnese where his father Elias emigrated from a little over a century ago. I placed my pointer finger over where I estimated Stemnitsa was, his village. I glanced beside me to the unoccupied seat and wished that he was beside me. I knew I felt him with me. He was in my heart, encouraging me and I knew above he was dancing that his engonós (grandson) was arriving in the land of our ancestors.
I arrived to Athens with no itinerary prepared. I also had no cellular data, so I was already in for an adventure. While this would concern most people I found it better to wing it. An itinerary impeded spontaneity I believed. I was to follow my travel ethos. Be curious and spontaneous. Befriend the local people and live like they do. The “just wing it and see what happens” approach had already taken me far. It afforded me a flexibility that I had enjoyed. It allowed me couch surf in Vienna and befriend two german girls in Portugal. Easy for a white 23 year old male, foolish enough to believe that he manifested this fortuitous timing. Granted it seemed like a recipe for disaster. Often the best moments of travel are the least expected ones. They are the moments you can’t reserve on booking.com. This is a central pillar in my travel ethos. Be present, be curious, be outgoing and learn.
I disembarked the plane with an excitement akin to that of a schoolboy leaving for summer vacation. My immediate objective was to find my way to the city center. With this thrill coursing through my veins, I boarded the X95 bus and seated myself. The man beside me put on his headphones, tuning himself out, but I wanted to tune in. Tune in to this wonderful sensation, this natural high of being in the land of my forefathers.
After taking a seat towards the back, my ears suddenly perked up. It was a familiar language. It was not greek, nor english but rather Spanish. Oh how that thrilled me! I tilted my head back ever so subtly, confirming that given their accent they were a spaniard. I took a glance back at a young man by himself with a phone pressed to his year. We made eye contact and I lingered by eye contact past him, as if I was inspecting the back of the buss to bluff my intrusive gaze. I turned back around, and cracked a smile. He knew I was interested in him. I knew I had to introduce myself. I had attracted a spaniard. It was only natural.
After he ended the call I summoned the courage to introduce myself. His name was Chevem (pronounced “Chema”). “Encantado!” I told him, shaking his hand. He was from Madrid prompting me to tell him, “Me mola mazo Madrid”. He was endeared that I knew such colloquialism. I further appealed to his sense of patria sharing with him of my travels to Madrid and my appreciation of its art and beauty. He was already eager to help orient me around Athens, for he was a tour guide and would show me around he promised. I felt he had been sent from Hermes. As if on cue, a group of tourists asked us what stop we were approaching. Chevem answered them in english and switched back into Spanish to continue our conversation. I felt this seemingly insignificant code switch affirmed my high level of Spanish. He was endeared by an American traveling alone, with an intimate knowledge of Madrid and its colloquialism. It thrilled him to know that I was from Boston, as he told me his close American friend Martin too was from Boston. We became quick companions. Me molaba mazo ese madrileño.
Soon the bus was approaching Syntagma, the city center. We got off together, as he told me his friend was awaiting him to drive him back. He did me a grand favor by sharing his celular data so I could navigate my way to the hostel. We left promising each other that we’d hang out.
When I walked into the hostel I felt like I was crashing a party. The place was buzzing with travelers. I waded through excited travelers drinking and sharing stories to get to the bar which functioned as the hotel’s reception desk. I soon learned it was happy hour. Everyone certainly seemed content, a group of travelers to my left were making a toast.
While checking in, a woman seated to my left answered my question about the Acropolis Museum I had asked the receptionist, informing me it was closed. She then to my surprise invited me to join her for a drink. Despite my fatigue, I joined her briefly, bonding over our common experience running cross country and passion for travel. Suddenly, I felt someone to my right. A women had approached the bar to check in. I moved my chair to afford her more space. I returned myself to the conversation, but with the new guest so close behind me I became distracted. Out of the corner of my eye I sneaked a glance as she headed upstairs, and a sense of regret lingered in me for having not spoken with her. Who was that I wondered.
Feeling hungry and the need for some alone time, I excused myself and headed out alone for dinner. The traveller who had befriended me offered to accompany me, but I politely declined. I was guarding myself a little. For some reason, remaining alone felt most comfortable. Tired, and perhaps accustomed to my solitude, I needed to decompress after hours of travel (in two days I had traveled through three countries).
Soon I found myself at a nearby gyro shop, just around the corner. I was spacing in and out while waiting for my order. Soon, I heard the cook call to me, calling me twice “Friend, friend!”. I turned around to see him smiling beckoning me retrieve the pork souvlaki I had ordered. It was delicious. I was to return here several times, for the quality and for the cheap prices, 2.50 euros for a souvlaki. The place seemed to be family owned becuase of the charm it exuded.
Not a few minutes later entered a young, attractive women dressed in all black. She was alone as well and seemed oddly familiar. She was beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. Black hair and fair skin. She ordered and went outside, I presumed to smoke. One minute there, then she was gone. Quicker than I could think to approach her. My mind, which had been in a state of dormancy due to the exhaustion of traveling that day, came to life. Had I been more awake I might have ordered another souvlaki and waited behind her to strike up a conversation. No, I thought to myself, that would have seemed to contrived. Best that I leave her alone, I figured. But something began stirring within me, urging me to reach out and introduce myself. Just as I had done a hour ago with Chevem. I ordered another souvlaki, perhaps to buy myself more time to think as she was now outside eating her dinner.
Time was ticking. I was mustering up the courage to approach her. Of course I had to. It would be disingenuous to my nature to pass her by without a friendly hello. Yet this is what I did. I left. I didn’t even look her way. She intimidated me. A few paces away from her I halted myself in my tracks. I can’t forego this, I thought. A fierce dialogue was taking place in my head. The voice of spontaneity and the voice, perhaps, of reason. On somewhat of an autopilot I approached her calmy and directly so she could see me. The next moments were a blur.
“Hello, I was hoping to eat with you. What’s your name?” My voice felt shaky as I spoke, and I barely had time to wonder if she could perceive my nervousness or if my words sounded odd before she smiled and replied, “My name is Lisa.”
Noticing her accent, I asked curiously, “Are you French?”
“Yes, I live in Paris,” she said, and my heart fluttered a bit. Her accent was charming. I took a deep breath and attempted my French: “Enchanté, je m’appelle Ryan, Can I take a seat?”
“Of course!”
It was that easy. It somehow seemed easier in Athens. Like it was the only city that two strangers could come together and befriend one another in the snap of a finger. Lighting a cigarette, she shared with me that she’d recently been let go from her job. She was taking advantage of the time to travel, clear her head and search for a new job. I shared with her of my travels through Europe. We quickly bonded over our love for Spain, has she had done Erasmus in Málaga, but confessed to me that she knew little Spanish. Her smile encouraged me, and I felt a rush of warmth by her openness and interest in befriending me. It felt like she too was craving some company.
She soon revealed her impeccable English, delivered with a delightful French accent. Typically, in the first few words, she would insert an “uh” at the end of certain consonants, creating a blunt yet charming inflection. Occasionally, she extended her “a’s,” pronouncing them as “uh’s,” a subtle reflection of her French background. She was already eager to spend time with me and began suggesting ideas. “We could (uh) go to the (uh) park and grab a café,” she suggested, her speech flowing melodically. The predominant quality of her articulation was the way her words blended together, allowing suffixes to soften until certain word groupings became nearly indistinguishable. It was so charming to listen to. She was a chatter box. “I think I have herdt of Boston yes!” she told me.
Not only was her company a wonderful, unexpected gift, but coming to know her that night brought to light the topics most dear to me: my family, friends, and experiences in Spain. Sharing these stories made them feel closer, and brought Lisa closer to me. She opened up about her family, too. With neither of us knowing much about the other’s past, I found such a warmth with her. My heart began to soften as I let go of the negative prejudices towards the French I had internalized from my Italian and Spanish friends. There are bitter rivalries in Europe and France is often on the short end of the stick because squished between all these countries. This generalized animosity towards them.
We put it together that we were staying at the same Hostel. And yes, it was a familiar face because she had been the women who checked in beside me. I had the sense it was her. We walked back together, exchanged numbers and made plans to have breakfast the following morning.
Going out the night before. Smoking for the first time. Karoake.
Within twenty minutes I was standing on hostel’s roof top marveling at the Parthenon. I was still on cloud nine, trying to wrap my head that I already hade made friends in a foreign city. A lot awaited me in that moment. I remained there for a few minutes, appreciating the Acropolis. I called my sister Alexis to her know that I’d arrive safely, and her enthusiasm echoed my own, fueling my anticipation for the adventures that lay ahead As soon as my head hit the pillow I fell asleep.
The next morning, after a restorative night of sleep, I woke up with an insatiable desire to explore. A breeze of fresh air entered the room. I stretched my arms and yawned as I peered over the balcony. The street was mostly covered by these beautiful orange trees. The sidewalks were covered with oranges. The apartments were all white. A cat entered my vision and darted across the road as a car approached. Awake too were the birds. I felt this street was inviting me outside. If every street had this enchanting quality to it I would be content with just a walk through Athens. I had no anxiety to google some generic, curated list of landmark, some “top ten things to do in Athens”. I didn’t need the internet to generate ideas. I sought my own experience. I sought adventure.
I found a table tucked in the corner of lobby and grabbed some fruit. Minutes later Lisa came down and sat down across from me. I continued to share with her what little french culture (music and pop culture) I had assumed from my french friends in León. As she went to grab breakfast I fetched my notebook from my room to jot down some notes as she had already begun to teach me a little french. I wrote for practice “J’aime Marseilles” sharing with her that I would greet my french friend named Theo, from Marseilles, whenever I would see him. Lisa responded “I love Marseilles too”. I made the hand motion that french rapper Juul does, which further endeared her. I appealed to he what little french culture I knew. She was delighted by it all.
After a pleasant breakfast with Lisa I went for a saunter around the Acropolis, familiarizing myself with the area and serendipitously encountering the Areopagus Hill. It is said to be the spot where the Apostle Paul first preached the gospel to the Athenians. I could see why any orator would choose the site, a prominent position where crowds could gather around.
Descending from Areopagus Hill my wandering took me into the city center past Syntagma where I watched the changing of the guard in front of the tomb of the unknown soldier, the n front of the capital building. After the solemn ceremony concluded I went and found another great gyro restaurant.
When I entered the lobby of the Hostel I recognized the man who I had shared the room with last night. I introduced myself to him and learned he was Mumbai. He was friendly and travel savy. We discussed how it had been uncomfortably hot in the room (which is why I alerted him that I creaked open the balcony door to allow some fresh air in). I told him about my pleasant walk I had gone on. It was peaceful walk. You’re not rushed when you walk alone. He told me that he loved traveling alone because everything is done at your pace. He was an agreeable man, filled with anecdotes of travel.
I was amazed to read a small kiosk that taught me of St. Paul’s passage through the area in 51 A.D. The Areopagus Hill is said to have been where Apostle Paul disseminated the tenants of the christianity to the Athenians. That was nearly two millennia ago. Incredible. A marine officer named Josh, who I would meet through the hostel, told me that Athenians, philosophers and politicians would congregate their to debate. It was spot I would return to several times, it wouldn’t get old. I went alone, I went with Lisa one time, I went with Josh and another guy to enjoy the view at night. The touristy environment almost adds to the experience. I practiced a little of my Italian with a family who asked me for their photo to be taken.
From the Areopagus Hill I let the hill take my down into the city center, passing through Syntagma, the city center, and the parliament building. Ahead on the side walk, I saw two soldiers marching towards me. They were dressed in a white garb with a red hat, a traditional uniform.
When I passed the parliament building, again on my way back, I saw the same soldiers guarding what I would learn was the tomb of forgotten soldier. I just happened to catch the change of guard. It reminded of when I was in Arlington national cemetery, witnessing the change of guard at the tomb of the unidentified soldier. We were there for the fourth of July. I was twelve then. Now, standing in Athens, I was reflecting again upon the valor and selflessness of the soldier, ten years older.
I continued walking, thinking about where I would eat. Soon I was seated in a gyro spot that I happened to come upon. The gryo was great. I thought they might have treated me to dessert because I was alone, but I would later learn it is customary in Greece for a small desert to be served.
After lunch I was in need of a siesta, and though tired I was curious to know this convenience shop across the street of the hostel. I was drawn to it by the little fruit stand, with crates of fruit and with bananas hanging. . Drinks, snack, cigarettes organized across the shelves gave the shop a cozy feeling. It had a charm.
I made the conscious decision to buy a greek product, a kind of greek oreo which caught my eye. How was I going to buy there, an oreo I had been eating my entire life? I returned to lie down in my little bed, curious as to how these oreos would taste. These were were the best I’d ever eaten. These had double the quantity of vanilla cream, it tasted fresher and cookie/biscuit part tasted a rich chocolate.
While munching on my third or fourth one (nearly half the pack) I came to discover that I was munching on the original Oreos, called in greek, Papadopoulou. This particular, more mass produced variant, comes from the traditional gemista biscuits. The Oreo I was accustomed too, is the american adaptation, the new kid on the block. The extent of the Greek influence is impressive, I began to realize they had their hands, they invented everything. After I had them, I began to see the papadopoulou’s everywhere I went.
After a little siesta, it was late-afternoon. I checked insta where awaiting me were unread messages from Lisa, who was curious as to my plans. I told her I was going to see a post-impressionist exhibit about a fifteen minute walk from the hostel. We decided to meet there within the hour. I revived myself and made my way over, hoping Lisa en route too, as I remained without data.
I had learned of the exposition from having flipped through a travel brochure on the plane. It was the first of many activities we did together. And through browsing the exposition, I learned more about her. Many of works were based on places with the French Riviera. We conversed about works set in Marseille and Saint Tropez, the later where her sister lives. She told me how beautiful those places are and recommended I travel there. I learned her father is an artist, and though now retired, was an art director (That’s how I would come to learn about Alekos Fassianos, a greek painter, Lisa’s Dad encouraged her to go see). In fact it was after the exposition, Lisa told me she wanted to go to see Fassianos.
After strolling through the well curated exposition we were curious as to what the other galleries contained. The only issue was our ticket was only for the exposition, not the rest of the museum. Though that didn’t discourage us from at least trying to enter the other galleries. We would only get as far as a few steps into them until we were caught, and asked to leave. We tried entering each floor’s gallery, hoping maybe one attendant would be more lenient than the prior, but to no avail. We laughed at ourselves. I did manage to recognize a Giacometti portrait which right by the entrance of the second floor. It belonged to his 1950’s, 60’s abstract yet figurative dull color toned style. It was silly of us.
We had a nice walk back to the Hostel together, where I left her for the day. From the gallery though the route contained its own gems. We walked past the first Olympic stadium and alongside a park full of preserved classical greek pillars and such. I took siesta and when recharged wanted to return to the Agora hill, where I had been that morning, to catch the sunset. With the luxury of time, taking advantage of appreciating the sunset was very important to me. It was a bit cloudy but I enjoyed viewing the Acropolis illuminated by light at night. It appeared even more impressive. The view motivated me with the time remaining that night to go to the museum.
With only an hour remaining, there was barely anyone in the museum and I felt that I had it all to myself. I progressed my way through the floors arriving to the top floor where I encountered the marble friezes of the Parthenon. The Acropolis was in view, the Parthenon itself stood illuminated, visible through the window.
Across from what video essay about the Acropolis. I was drifting on and off. Despite my fatigue and intermittent lapses in attention (jolting awake when a couple passed by) I learned of the tragic saga of repeated plundering and pillaging. I was shocked to learn, a French ambassador, in a bid to document the Acropolis, commissioned an artist to sketch and survey it. They ordered them to “Take everything you can [from the Acropolis], leave not the living or dead” It was shocking to see that written. That it still remains despite everything its endured is incredible. Wars, pillaging, yet it remains testifying to its sacredness.
The friezes themselves are magnificent, I was left quite impressed, proud to be related to a culture which takes great pride in its art and tradition (and the friezes are the union of both). They are remarkably preserved, and beautifully crafted, a testament to the talent of their sculptors. They depict scenes from the annual celebration of Athena such as chariot riding and processions of soldiers and citizens. Something began to dawn on me though, as I browsed, as I passed through the floor. As I saw gap after gap left intentionally between the friezes, I began to feel quite sad. The museums had intentionally left these sizable gaps between the conserved friezes to serve as a poignant reminder of the western pillaging that occurred through its history.
Lord Elgin plundered these friezes. This impunity is deplorable. One can now see in the British Museum.
The next day we went to see the Acropolis up close. Having gone to the museum the night before, I was ready to appreciate now equiped with the it’s historical context. That morning I used the panini press and made myself a simple ham and cheese sandwich. I added some apple slices, tomatoes, I sat myself down with Lisa. After a little ham and cheese pannin some fruit and coffee I headed with her to the acropolis. I attempted to use my NIE card, which proved my residency in Spain to enter for free but they caught me. She was let in free for being under 27 and a EU citizen.
She was happy to help me learn a little french it was almost comical the contrast that she spoke english incredibly well and I with my ten words in french was just hopping to add an eleventh.
As we ascended up to the Acropolis, we were greeted by the striking ruins of the theatre and the statue of Dionysus. The archaeological remnants left us in awe. A cat rested on some stones, welcoming us to the ruins. Lisa, enchanted took out her phone to take a picture of the cat, with the view of the theatre behind. She told me she would send the photo to one of her sisters, also a cat lover. We began petting it. It’s back was warm and soft. I told the cat “enchante” french for enchanted. It seemed like there was a cat everywhere in Athens awaiting to greet us.
The Parthenon was striking to see up close. I concentrated on the friezes, only a few remained intact.
Lisa led me to over to the smaller temple of Athena where I began to hear spanish spoken among a group of tourists. There were gathering themselves to pose for a photo.
As we drew nearer, I mentioned to Lisa that they were Spanish, having caught a few words. One of them had said “Venga” which gave me a laugh. Suddenly I was being asked by one of them in english to take their photo. I was of course delighted, feeling lucky to be chosen as I was already speaking to them in Spanish. “A ver, que guapos, que grupo” This enchanted them. I explained to them that I was an American studying abroad in León, justifying my decision (as I often do)
One of them told me to go along with my girlfriend, as they assumed she was my girlfriend, I told them the truth that she was my travel companion. One of them said to me “todavía” Lisa was a bit shy with them but she did speak a little Spanish to their delight. We ran into them a few more times around the Parthenon, and they remained enchanted by this fluent Spanish speaking American and his french travel partner.
I loved talking about French and American culture with her as we walked around the Parthenon. We were looking out over into Athens. Athens is a sea of white apartment dotted with ruins. Lisa, her french accent, was very beautiful to listen to.
We also ate a really lunch. There was this appetizer I was going to order but the waiter interceded and recommended I get the eggplant one that is made following his grandmothers restaurant. It was as he said delicious. I also tried Tsatsiki sauce. My mom loves eating eggplant so I thought of her.
Meeting up with Chema was a challenge in of itself. Lisa and I were heading out to Syntigama, where he told us he’d come too, but I didn’t have any data. We had to duck into a café by Syntigama square so I could hop on the wifi and locate him. After walking around a little aimlessly, we found our bearings and confirmed with him that we were to meet him in front of a Gucci store. We waited a few minutes talking about(I wouldn’t realize the irony of our meet up point until getting to know him a bit later). I was reassuring Lisa that her Spanish was good enough to understand him.
He began to take us on a private tour of the area explaining to us the significance. He was speaking in Spanish.
We met Martin in a plaza where an old greek orthodox church stood. They showed us this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant called Alvi. The food was deilicious. No signage, one would have hardly recognized it existed at all. There was no receptionist, we passed through a narrow hall which led to an open space with these small tables. A cat crawled beneath my legs. I was enchanted with this local place far from tourist crowded sites.
We talked about many things, politics, political theory and in several different languages. English served as the common language when we all talked with one another. Chema and I would break off and speak Spanish with each other. Lisa and Martin communicated in French. Chema and Martin ordered in Greek. I was their pupil, they were my professors and new found friends on that warm Greek night — sharing food wine and conversing in Spanish, French, Greek, and English, speaking the language of those whose hearts align in hope and outrage against injustice. I had an insatiable curiosity to learn how Chema and Martin perceived art and history, language class struggle, Karl Marx, and Noam Chomsky.
I was amazed that here I was gathered in this local, off the map spot, with a beautiful french women accompanying me on my travel, a madrileño I had befriend on the bus and Martin, sharing stories of Athens and being an expatriot teacher. I must have taken it for granted that there I could be in their company, a young educated man about his tour through Europe, a member of an upper class family, and at the same time, with the company of this cultured french women, indulge himself in the diversion of meeting Anarchists; and enjoy a delicious meal as Chema and Martin explained, that the Athenian anarchist movement still breathed life into the last stronghold of international anarchism — a city harboring the fading echoes of ancient Athenian civilization. Lisa and I were with them but yet so far from their every day lived experience that I felt this fraudulence for simply agreeing with their radical view. Their raw authenticity, that they truly lived as they thought, compelled an agreeable response from me — one that felt utterly uncharacteristic. My professors and their progressive stances then seemed so inauthentic…
They told us that there was to take place a rally the next day because Greece was to privatize its school system. They invited us. We told them we would let them know. Our hesitancy discouraged them. After all we were travelers, how much was their to expect to us? They took that as a polite no, but I felt part of genuinely considering it. This wasn’t your standard vacation.
After dinner we went to this cool bar and because it closed we went with our drinks and found a little bench on the side of the street. They were smoking and the subject of the conversation was about French anarchism and the French Revolution the revolt of ’68 and the realist French art movement like Gustave Courbet
The gritty nature of the Athenian streets enchanted me. There’s this certain beauty to the urban messiness of Athens that I came to appreciate.
I don’t think I wasted a second of my time in Greece, certainly not by walking its streets with the simple desire to be lost in them. The following morning I rose early as was my habit while traveling and stretched my legs around the neighborhood. I was already getting a feel for the area and felt somewhat adjusted to the rhythm of the bustling city. I was content.
A man with a friendly face was stationed in the middle of the street. A street seldom trafficked by cars. I had already passed him once as I ventured out from the hostel, and he gave me a smile prompting me to greet him “kalimera” (good morning). In fact that simple interaction had given me the confidence to say kalimera to others who I passed, and this simple phrase helped me blend in, giving others the impression that I was a greek speaker. This felt incredible. It felt like I had really transformed myself into a native greek. Their came a certain validation from receiving these greek greeting, although they were simple and said reflexively I had an enormous pride to be engaging with them through their language.
There I was trying to make sense of what this man was promoting. To my delight, when I inspected more closely the entrance he was stationed by I realized he was working for the Cafavy Archive. The great greek poet C.P Cafavy had lived there. I felt a rush of excitement. I immediately thougt of my Dad who had introduced me to his genius. The friendly greek man outside approached me informing me that it was open to the public. He could see the excitement brewing within me. That was a lovely interaction for us both. I was spewing with excitement. Something told me he didn’t get to many 22 year old greek American solo traveler’s getting this excited for having stumbled upon the archive.
My excitement was contagious and it quickly spread to the rest of the staff who attended my questions. They informed me that the archive had just opened and I had been one of it’s lucky first visitors. They all seemed eager to answer any questions of mine. I felt well received.
These kind of fortuitous, meaningful discoveries were somehow awaiting me throughout the whole week. As I left the archive after having combed through everything it had to offer me, I interacted once more with the friendly gentlemen outside. I thanked him and wished him a good day. There’s a heightened sense of euphoria when one stumbles upon something that had been latently desired.
The archive reminded me of the epic poem of his, titled Ithaca. It was the appropriate poem to mull over given the adventure I had embarked on. The poem is sung to Ulysses the wayward captain returning from the Trojan war. It’s the journey that confirms the mission and the mission that confers the journey. The poem would remain with me for the rest of the trip. As I made the short walk back to the hostel, I felt enlightened. I began reciting the opening line of the poem. The words of the opening verses characterized the spirit of my travel.
As you set out for Ithaka
pray your journey is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
The remainder of the day was filled with adventure and discovery. Lisa took me to a café her friend recommended to her in Exarcheia. It was called Lacantina and we had falafel.
We were amazed at all the street art which made the entire neighborhood pop with color. At the museum of archeology we were impressed by this painting which one sees as they ascend the stairs.
We met up with Chema who was gracious enough to continue to touring us through Athens. He took me a bookstore where with help from an employee I was able to find a collection of Cafavy’s poetry that I wanted to gift my father. He was soon to retire. It was essentially again a private, expedited tour.
The following morning I needed to get myself to Piraeus, the nearest port to Athens. I wanted to visit this island that Lisa had told me about. Unfortunately, she wasn’t feeling well enough to do the excursion and had to remain resting in the hostel. I didn’t have any cellular data, so I mapped out the route and trusted everything would go smoothly.
The only complicated transfer was when I arrived Piraeus, I was unsure of what bus to take to get myself to the ferries. I could see the ferries, they were probably a mile or so away. While I decided what to do I order this sesame bagel stuffed with cream cheese. It was delicious. I got it from the kind of café that serves you directly on the street. I loved those little cafés.
I figured I would take any bus I could get and that I could assess from there if it was heading towards the ferries. Luckily I hopped on a bus that took me to more or less the spot I needed to be. I found the blue ferry building and I bought tickets from a kind greek women. She pointed her finger to the ferry that I needed to take and told me to hurry as it was embarking soon.
I rushed over. Got on board. And made my way to top. I could breathe. The hard part was over. I decided to take in the sun and rest a while.
After a short rest I wanted to walk around the ferry. It wasn’t so crowded. I found a corner where I could seclude myself and obtain a view of the ocean. It was msrvillous. The sea was shiny, glistening from the bright sun. I felt somewhat the sun made the blue of the ocean appear lighter, almost more vivid. I am not sure what the effect what but I felt my sense of vision improve itself. It was stunning to watch us approach these islands.
A women politely asked me if I could take picture of her and her daughter, pulling me from the hypnotizing effect of the sea. She was celebrating her fiftieth birthday by taking a trip with her daughter. I wished her a happy birthday.
I walked over with her to meet her daughter. There was something so warm about her that reminded of my mother. She called “my darling”. I was suddenly taken by their openess and warmth. They lived in London and spoke english with the British accent. Madu was a nurse and was born in Sri Lanka, a country unfortunately plagued with political violence.
Her daughter was my age and soon to graduate college. She wanted to become a doctor. I found her accent so charming. Their company and conversation quickened the ride and after talking about my year abroad, my family, America, politics and contemporary issues the ferry was already soon to dock. We soon parted ways and confirmed that we would see each other again on the return trip.
It didn’t take long for the island to enamor me. A charming little church greeted us on the dock. I had never seen a church on a dock before. Its white exterior seemed to glow ever strong with the sun’s pounding radiance. The sun warmed my spirit.
As I made my way through the town it easy to identify who and who wasn’t a local. There were tons locals riding motorcycles, the most comfortable mode of transport I figured. While they were in the middle of their errands, while travelers criss crossed the roads, impeding the flow of this slow paced island life. Even the signs enchanted me, as everything felt simpler, more elemental. I popped into greek orthodox churches and paused to take photos.
I didn’t know where I was going. I figured I would stick to the coast line and follow it. An hour had passed and I realized I was no where near the little village I had ventured out to see. The island was far bigger than I had estimated.
That’s when the courage came upon me to stick out my thumb and see if I could hitch hike, to really test the friendliness and openness of the greek people.
There was already a truck departing near me from this road I was coming from. When I held out my thumb and pointed with my other hand left the truck driver who I’d said , no he said greek and I instinctively said what he told me back he pointed the other way. Essentially he through his hands communicated that he was headed the opposite way.
The next car which drove by was this older mean who I saw was wearing a mask who politely acknowledged my request but politely declined touching his mask as to indicate de didn’t feel well. He didn’t want to contaminate me. Two cars later came Stavros who pulled ahead of me and scrambled to clear the passenger seat of some kind of bird cage. He was eager to have me. I didn’t even know exactly where I wanted to go, which didn’t seem to suprise him. I trust him and he assumed my destination was the next port which was where I intuitively was heading.
The seatbelt didn’t quite click activating an alarm. I had to hold it the buckle in place to cancel the alarm. We chatted for a brief five minutes and he taught me a little greek and he was delighted to hear that I, being American, had greek ethnic heritage. It was easy to impress him with phrases like “Christos anesti” “Opa!”. I thought he had a simple soul, so impressionable by my limited showing of greek. He was happy for me. I could tell that. It seemed like of all the people on the island and it was him who was awaiting for me to meet him. Something about the trust we had both in each other to go through with the hitch hike made the connection seemingly more profound.
By then it was early afternoon and the island became even more beautiful somehow. Time seemed to slow itself in this little enchanting port. Stavros had dropped me off and went about his errands.
There seemed to be more cats than humans.
I went through the village’s quiet streets. It was apparent I was the only tourist which felt odd. After wandering through the little port which didn’t take to long to fully know, I found a bench and sat myself down on the left side and within a second it collapsed under my weight. A few women behind me chucked and smiled at me, as I brought myself to my feet. Had I known greek I could have connected with them further. But the moment we shared was sufficient enough to express everything it held, the clumsiness and silliness of sitting in a bench that collapses beneath you. I tried to reassemble the bench but one of the green beam came out when I pulled it. Then I began to laugh and it felt so great to laugh as I walk away from the pile of beams that once was a bench.
Farther along the road I found a little rocky point along the coastline of ηέρδικλ to pause to reflect on the day, recording some thoughts in my travel journal. I recorded some of Cafavy’s poetry. As I gazed across the ocean toward the island, it felt as though the entire spectrum of blue had come alive before me — each shade represented. The sky and sea seemed to blend into one infinite canvas, every pigment of blue imaginable dancing between them. I closed my eyes momentarily, letting the first glimmer of sight settle in my mind, only to open them again, just to remind myself it was real.
Before me stretched a shimmering path, reaching across the ocean out into the horizon beneath the sun’s embrace. The gentle chirping of birds filled the air, weaving themselves into the rhythm of the waves. In that moment, I was utterly still, wholly content, and wonderfully alive.
I was so content.
I was in a state of atraxia, a state of tranquility and equanimity, free from worry and distress. Atraxia is derived from the Greek words a-, meaning “not”, and tarassein, meaning “to disturb or confuse”. Epicureans sought ataraxia as the highest goal and considered it to be true happiness.
After a brief stint of reflection I sat myself down at a calm restaurant for a late lunch. Everything I had was so fresh and delicious.
I was seated contemplating what I wanted to choose for dessert. I was going to receive a customary dessert and was given the option. A lady across from was ease dropping and interceded for me. She was an elderly women who insisted that I try a certain dessert. Of course, I obliged and went with her recommendation. She and her husband were retired greek Americans who had recently made the island their home. They told me how peaceful it was to live there. They soon gained my trust. It gave them joy to know I was greek American. They took me under their wing and expressed their concern that I was not going to make the ferry on time. I was so relaxed it would not have stressed me to coordinate how I was ever to make it back on time with no ride. They told me they would bring me.
First they wanted to show me the island. They had fallen in love with their new home. They had friends through the island and as we passed their home they shared with me anecdotes of the friendliness of their neighbors. I was impressed by how concentrated the island was with these tiny churches. Bella told me there were 360 churches dotted across the island. They explained to me that the island was home to the monastery of a greek Saint named Agios Nectarios, also known as the Wonderworker of Aegina. He was miracle healer who is considered the patron saint of people with cancer, heart disease, arthritis, epilepsy, and other illnesses. Dino told me: “and give his money to the poor people whatever money they give”
They drove me through the winding roads of the island and brought me to see the monastery, one of the most visited sites on Aegina. The monastery grounds include a large church and a small chapel where St. Nectarios’ tomb is located. Thousands of pilgrims come to the island every year they told me to honor him. They were devout greek orthodox christians and their faith inspired me. They spoke so simply. “Follow your grandfather, it makes sense” Dino said to me. He implored me to become greek orthodox.
As we zipped towards the main port I felt an incredible desire to rekindle my sense of pride in being greek. I felt an incredible honor to share ancestry with these humble simple people. I expressed to them my desire to buy pistachios. The island was known for its pistachios. They dropped me off near a pistachio vendor. I had a hour to kill and wanted also to explore the nearby marketplace. There was a fish market and other stores that I bopped into. I came across an artist selling his drawings. I stopped to appreciate his artwork. He drew on whatever he could find, scraps of paper and this captivated me. He read my interest and gave me a price. I confessed to him that I didn’t have much cash and we negotiated a price for a few drawings. I was thankful. I complimented him. He told me he was a Belgian but the art world disillusioned him and he left to find a simpler way of life. He felt he had become creatively a slave to his patrons and yearned to have the freedom to create as he pleased. He had a lucrative career in Antwerp, but walked away from all the money to rediscover his happiness. I found that admirable.
Then as I was walking away from him to my delight a fish vendor called to me signaling that Madu was chasing me down. I didn’t know that she was seated at a nearby restaurant, and through a window had spotted me speaking with the artist. She invited me into the restaurant and asked if I was hungry. I politely told them I was good but appreciated their generosity. I could tell they really enjoyed my presence, which made them already feel like family to me. It’s amazing how quickly you can bond with strangers through this particular feeling.
I also had gone into other merchant’s shops. I tried baklava. The sweet crunchy flakey dessert. Its origins are contested amongst the Greeks, Turks and Lebanese with some saying it originated in Persia. The store owners were very kind to me. They exuded kindness as had everyone on the island.
Later that night I return to Athens via the metro with Madu and her daughter. It was a pleasant return. Lisa awaited me and we went out for dinner. It was a magical day. I was reflecting and treasuring the experiences I was having, bringing them deep within my heart.
I arose after a restorative sleep somewhat on the later side. When I came down to the hostel lobby I found Tristan, the guy from Maine I had befriended. He was seated at the bar and I told him it was Joshua Laurence a chamberlain the colonel who defended the union left flank at Gettysburg. He was a history buff like me and I appealed to his Maine nativity. He was excited at what I had learned. After hours of fighting they ran out of ammunition so Chamberlin ordered a bayonet charge. The line prevailed and the Union army won the battle. The night before we were talking about the civil war and how he grew up attending St. George a private school where Rucker Carlson’s kids attended. He knew Bobby. He loved sailing. We enjoy several chats together. He was one of many people I so easily bonded with that week.
Lisa came down for breakfast and I excused myself from Tristan to greet her. We ate breakfast together and I showed her the art I bought from Chem the migrant Dutch artist on Aegina. Lisa and I had only more or less of an idea for our itinerary. We tossed out ideas, while trying some of the delicacies I had procured from the island. We tried the pistachio wafers fillers with this pistachio butter cream. They were really rich almost too much I joked. I even gave one to Josh who also was at breakfast. I recommended he go to the island and gave him the run down. He was there in Greece on leave from his military service. He was a greek orthodox and was excited to explore all the churches. Aegina would be great. I told him of my travel and he seemed eager to go. He in return recommended I go to Socrates prison.
Lisa and I went to yesterdays bread where I bought a nice vintage flannel. We’ve really had all this time this week to get to know each other. I’ve been following the story of her job situation and prospects marketing this French purse brand. Her first interview went well and today she met with the HR women to discuss salary. The final interview is this Monday so I’m praying that she gets it. The consequences weren’t that grave if she doesn’t get. In fact it would free her schedule allowing her to join her family in the Pyrenees to ski. It impressed me that she express these conflicting feeling in english so fluently.
After a little thrift shopping and Lisa’s fashion advice, we went out separate ways her to the interview and to the Alekos Fassianos exhibit. You realize here that people walk very nonchalantly. It’s a beautiful neighborhood. It’s quite sad that the center park is occupied. The federal government is planning to build a metro in Exarchia even though the referendum BU the locals was overwhelmingly against it.
The Fassianos exhibit was this hole in the wall place. There was no signage indicating where it was. I arrived and someone was scavenging through trash directly outside. I had the good fortune of arriving when a Greek women did too. I could tell she was also confused and asked her. She went into a convenience store where with the owner she asked. We eventually found it but I kind of piggybacked off her Greek to find it. I might not have found it without her presence, even though it was hidden in plain day. It was odd.
The exhibit was great. I really liked his style. It’s Picassoesque but very much his own. I particularly liked the one of Hermes on the bicycle. The greek God of messages is depicted on a bike, which I thought was quite suiting. His color palette too is so beautiful. I like the little details he incorporates into the background of his painting. Churches and often appear in his works. I must have spent a hour soaking in everything I could about the artist. I even bought some of his postals.
I had learned of him through the Lisa’s Dad who recommended she go. He was an art director teacher and continues to paint teaching a class to newly arrived immigrants. He draws a lot of nudes. Lisa actually doesn’t like his style which was a very honest confession. But she of courses loves him and the other day she called him while we were walking to get his advice. (How are you in French is pronounced more like saw va)
When I met up with Lisa after it was at six dogs a cafe besides a tattoo parlor that seemed good. I had been expressing to her my desire to get one and she encouraged me. The tatoo artist was named Bill. Bill was like always go with the women’s advice bc I though to get the smaller one. I got my first tattoo of the word Arete. Greek rap was playing in the back. I was nervous. Having Lisa there meant a lot to I think she really was encouraging. I got it tatted behind my elbow the the ancient greek word Αρετή — “arete”. It’s a beautiful word which translates to having excellence in all facets of life. It means to strive to achieve excellence in the moral, physical and mental spaces of one’s life. But beyond its translation, I’ll dive later into the meaning of the tattoo.
That night Lisa and I left the hostel to go see the sunset over Athens. We went to the Areopagus hill which is said to be where St. Paul preached the gospel to the Athenians. The view was beautiful of the city. The acropolis and everything was super pretty. Lisa and I agreed it’s better to have about a week to get to know a city like about the size of Athens. You’re not rushed and you can really get to all the areas, even the non tourist areas.
Martin recommended we go see it from here: His footnote to the link was “Go to the basketball courts then climb up the hill” https://maps.app.goo.gl/7xyos2vv716bxahg6?g_st=iw
After the sunset we met Martin at the Omonio metro station. From there we walked to a restaurant in a neighborhood he told us is starting to become trendy but still not known by tourists. That’s always music to my ears, I am always conscience of my effort to experience the authentic neighborhoods of a place. Around the hostel and Acropolis is the tourist friendly district.
Martin took us to a restaurant called Exodus Kafeneio. Martin ordered three beers for us in Greek. The waiter was friendly, Martin is considerate too he wanted to ensure we had the seats which faced the street. We were there sipping our mythos thanks to him. I relished this pork in wine and pepper sauce dish and tried some of what Martin got Turkish tortellini (tortellini with beef, cow butter, yogurt and garlic sauce, chili pepper flakes) it was great.
Martin opened up to us about his book project which is about this person who is searching for a lost artist across Detroit and Greece. He was telling us about how little the teachers are paid and many teachers work and come back from work to teach four classes of English to get by. The majority of people lost all their savings in 2008 and 2012 and people live without savings.
He used to be a communist but now is an anarchist. He shared us a story about how he was protesting in Charleston during the George Floyd riots (he was bartending there) and when the rioters smashed into a break the communist discouraged it. He realized that then they weren’t as radical as they though. They wouldn’t support the redistribution of wealth to members oppressed by centuries of racism. Also in Athens in 2011 the anarchist had the numbers to storm the parliament building but the communists prevented them. The communists and anarchists do not get along in Athens.
It’s hard to explain, and I’m sure I won’t get it quite right. You see, when you travel, you experience the moment you’re in, which absorbs you completely. It pulls you into the present, as everything you see feels new. But travel also has a way of pulling you backward in time, and even forward into the future.
Spending time with Lisa made me realize just how warm and open-minded she is, which softened some of my once harsh, intense attitudes toward the French. She confessed — quite honestly — one of the common generalizations about French students on Erasmus: their tendency to isolate themselves with only each other. And yet, I found myself defending them, comparing it to how Americans can be far more insular and ignorant. My time in Athens didn’t make me less interested in Americans; it made me even more curious about Europeans and their ways of thinking. I felt beholden to them, learning so much from their culture, their history, and their perspective.
Somehow during my week in Athens my thoughts always returned back to my family, especially my sister. We called each other one night and I cried telling her how much I missed her. I had never felt so close to my immediate family — my sister, my dad, my mom — thinking especially of her and the way she relates to our father, Angelo. Travel itself triggers its own kind of internal journey — one of reflection. Memories return, and moments once forgotten recrystallize, emerging with a clarity they didn’t have before. It’s as if the act of moving through space creates a new lens through which the past is suddenly sharper, more vivid, and connected to the present in unexpected ways.
In the end, my time in Athens was not just a trip across the world; it was a journey through time, through family, and through the layers of identity that have shaped me. The presence of my Pappous, though no longer physical, was a constant companion — guiding me, encouraging me, and reminding me of the values he lived by. As I traced the geography of my ancestry, my travels took on a deeper meaning. It was not merely about seeing new places; it was about rediscovering a part of myself that had long been dormant, a part of me that is both Greek and American.
I discovered the works of Alekos Fassianos and the french post impressionists. The vivid, dreamlike paintings of Fassianos seemed to speak directly to the spirit of the Greek people — capturing the mythic beauty of Greece while reflecting its modern, complex soul. Each painting felt like an extension of the landscape itself, echoing the timeless dance between the past and present.
And it was C.P. Cavafy’s words from Ithaca that echoed in my mind as I walked along the shore of Aegina: “To buy fine things, mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, sensual perfume of every kind — as many sensual perfumes as you can.” The poem spoke to the idea that the journey is as important as the destination, and that the true treasures lie in the experiences themselves. In this, I found a blueprint to reflect upon my own journey. The beauty of an island which unfolded itself in layers to me: the shimmering glow casted over the tranquil waters; the warmth of the sun and people, their hospitality as beautiful and inviting as the land itself.
It was on that island, I realized that my journey mirrored the archetypal one Cavafy describes: I heard the call, I passed the tests, and I left transformed. Greece, with all its layers of history, culture, and personal connection, continues to call me back. In its landscapes, its people, and its poetry, I found not only echoes of my Pappous’s legacy but also the deepest parts of myself.
This trip became more than just a moment in time — it was a full circle, a reunion with my heritage and an awakening to the world around me. As I carry these experiences, I feel myself walking further into the future, yet always anchored by the wisdom of the past. Greece will always be there, calling me to return, as it continues to shape my path forward.

Interview by Alexander Strecker
The streets (and walls) of Athens have been covered — truly covered — in graffiti for as long as I can remember. As a child visiting from the United States, I didn’t know what to make of these indecipherable tags and scribbles. More broadly, I remember how my feelings about Athens itself were consistently ambivalent. Sometimes I reveled in the city’s chaos; other times I was certain that it was the ugliest place I had ever seen. But as I grew older, and started to travel more widely, Athens’ particularities steadily became more striking to me. Not only did I begin to feel a deep admiration for its flagrant disregard of my opinion, but more specifically, I came to realize how the city’s graffiti contained multitudes. Visiting year after year, a neighborhood walk became many things: a political education (ΕΞΩ ΤΟ ΝΑΤΟ! — NATO, Get Out!); an invaluable source for vocabulary (perhaps best not rewritten here); and finally, a reminder of how a city that always felt both old and new, crumbling yet unchanging, could be the site of ongoing struggle and reinvention. Today, I see these tags and murals as inextricable components of the city’s fabric, as much as the venerated antiquities or devilish topography.
For the multi-disciplinary artist Alexandros Simopoulos, graffiti has also been a near-constant presence in his experience of living and making work in Athens. As early as high school, graffiti served as a creative outlet for Alexandros, establishing an underlying layer that he would later return to and cover over, again and again, in different ways. He continued to produce work while a student in university — where he focused on humanitarian law and international relations, both of which would also express themselves in his artistic work — but still, he could not get graffiti out of his mind. After university, he was once more drawn to the art form, producing graffiti-inspired t-shirts, skateboards, and prints. His timing was propitious: street art was having what Alexandros calls, “its second renaissance in Athens” amidst the growing financial crisis. He quickly realized that his adolescent hobby could become so much more.
Alexandros explains, “The story of graffiti and street art is complex and contradictory. Even the very terms of ‘graffiti’ and ‘street art’ have highly contested histories, which continue to generate intense debate inside and outside the community. In Athens, though, this story had a local twist during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, there were endless reports from major international media outlets about street art in the Greek capital [for example: How Angry Street Art is Making Athens Hip]. The angle was that there must be some key relationship between the country’s economic situation and the city’s street art. The easy narrative: graffiti as resistance, with its images providing an accessible aestheticization of the country’s problems, such as urban poverty, alongside a manifestation of its ‘brave spirit.’ But very few of these articles undertook any in-depth research; rather, I think graffiti provided a free and edgy illustration for their pieces. The crisis put Greece in the spotlight and street art became a handy example.” He then reveals, with a knowing smile, “I am pretty sure that some artists made political work on certain streets because they knew it would be spotted by journalists and later published in, for example, The International New York Times. Easy narratives can be manipulated by both sides…”

In Athens, though, this story had a local twist during the height of the financial crisis. The easy narrative: graffiti as resistance, with its images providing an accessible aestheticization of the country’s problems. He then reflects, “But what’s important to remember is that there was plenty of street art and political graffiti in Athens before the crisis.”
Yet as the old adage goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity. As Alexandros explains, “Over the past decade, street art has also created tourism for Athens. Many people travel here to paint — or, at least, they used to — we call them ‘graffiti tourists’. In Greece, it’s easy to work outside, especially since making graffiti is not heavily criminalized and the weather is good. The popularity of street art has certainly contributed to the touristification of the Athenian center, for better and for worse. For my generation, it has certainly been for worse: the recent inundation of visitors, and Airbnbs, has outpriced us all when it comes to housing.” He then reflects, “But what’s important to remember is that there was plenty of street art and political graffiti in Athens before the crisis. Additionally, street art has been used for gentrification for quite some time, all over the world, Berlin being a celebrated example (though we see it in London, New York, Barcelona and other places as well). Artists move where there is space and where it is cheap. All of these phenomena are not confined to a few trendy neighborhoods in post-2010 Athens.”
Alexandros understands these complications better than most: he has engaged with the street art community on many levels, at home and, lately, abroad. In Athens, he not only produced his own work, but collaborated with Cacao Rocks, another prominent practitioner [as well as an inaugural SNFA Artworks Fellow], to run a gallery in the city center dedicated to street artists. As he tells me, “Several years ago, Cacao and I shared a studio in the building’s basement. The gallery was on the ground floor. There, we had more or less free rein to do what we wanted. For over three years, we invited people we knew and gave them a welcoming space to experiment with formats. We even flew in artists from abroad to do mini-residencies and exhibit their work, bringing international points of view to Greece. In addition, the gallery worked as a small arts school for the kids of the neighborhood. It was an amazing experience — at its peak, it was a vibrant hub for varied people to meet, collaborate, experiment, and the spark for many new projects. The gallery was at the core of a small street art scene that was growing bigger and bigger. I remember that Cacao and I once had a completely sold-out show — but no matter how many gallery exhibitions we held and no matter how much work we sold, we lived in a parallel world: we were definitely not part of the contemporary art scene in Athens, nor was it something which we were interested in joining at that time.”
As Alexandros looks back on this heady time, I can hear the mixture of pride and frustration that accompanies the position of the perpetual outsider. Being on the edge — whether as a street artist excluded from contemporary art or as an artist living in Athens, a place that remains on the “periphery” of the global art world — affords a great deal of freedom. But it can also be isolating. Regardless, Alexandros reminds me that periphery is always a relative concept. He refers to the example of the 2017 edition of Documenta to underscore how the art world is never monolithic: at every level, there are insiders and outsiders, irreconcilable narratives, and overlapping spectrums of power. He says, “Documenta portrayed Athens as a locality of chaos and crisis and, at the same time, rebirth and self-determination. It was a narrative drawn from many sources, which made it appealing for different people, especially artists. Still, the event ultimately came from the outside, and thus its narrative exoticized Athens. It didn’t, perhaps couldn’t, explore all the complexities contained here.”

Over the past few years, Alexandros’ own path reveals his efforts to bridge these many competing approaches and gaps — between street and art, politics and space, Greece and abroad. As he tells me, “What’s so special about street art, more than anything, is its directness. It can reach people in their everyday lives. I’m interested in working across worlds, not just speaking to curators and critics. I want to create work that communicates with everyone.” In pursuit of a more legible visual language, Alexandros first left Athens to study illustration and visual arts in London. He then returned, now with a wider focus on making work that deals with the idea of public space — not illegally but as an invited guest. He tells me, “I’m not painting outside much anymore. I don’t even consider myself a street artist at this point. Instead, I am contending with the difference between what I thought I was doing and its perception from the outside. Conceptually, I am thinking about questions such as ‘What happens in your body when you paint graffiti? What happens in your mind? What kind of narratives do you come across, what kind of people, how are they communicated — and how has all of this transformed cities around the world? Concretely, my expanded point of view means I now work with a greater range of people, all of whom have widely disparate perceptions of street art and public space more broadly. Through these interactions, I am exploring my relationship to public spaces from other people’s perspective. I try to actively engage them in the creative process or even make them part of the work.”
As a former student of humanitarian law and international relations, Alexandros’ broadening point of view continues to ripple outward, well outside of Greece. For example, this past summer, he spent three months in Berlin and, prior to that, six months in New Mexico as a Fulbright Fellow. He also received public commissions to paint murals in locations ranging from Hungary to Portugal, and even Greenland. He reflects on the privilege, and challenges, of extending his work in this way. “Traveling creates a global community and network of artists who can exchange skills and ideas. This has always existed in the street art scene — while a piece might not travel, the people who make these public spaces are able to move and bring their knowledge with them to new settings. This does present some complications, though. When I travel to make work, I am confronting a place I’m not from, where I might be unaware of specific tensions or histories. The only way to overcome this deficit is to spend as much time there as possible before making any work and to meet and interact as sincerely as possible with people from different communities. Wherever I go, I try to respond to those around me and make the art meaningful for everyone involved. This has become the most challenging and rewarding part of the process for me.”
“I’m not painting outside much anymore. I don’t even consider myself a street artist at this point. Instead, I am contending with the difference between what I thought I was doing and its perception from the outside. Conceptually, I am thinking about questions such as ‘What happens in your body when you paint graffiti? What happens in your mind? What kind of narratives do you come across, what kind of people, how are they communicated — and how has all of this transformed cities around the world?”
Alexandros’ new perspective has not only helped him with his work overseas, but to look at Greece with fresh eyes. This was evident in Still Here Tomorrow, the Artworks group exhibition held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation last summer. In the show, Alexandros’ piece effectively juxtaposed views from inside and outside, embodying his desire to understand other points of view while retaining his local roots. The installation, titled Best served old (Anti-austerity artists are impressing the tourists), mixed street art motifs such as pigeons and stray dogs with aesthetics taken from ancient Greek art — red and black-figure vase painting and portrait statuary — as well as the pan-Balkan blue evil eye. According to his artist statement, the entire installation was meant to evoke the pandering displays in tacky souvenir shops. But beneath the dark humor, Alexandros had a positive message. “Many of the images on these ceramics relate to stories of tradition. Tradition in Greece (and elsewhere) has been the basis for countless horrible, nationalistic, and extremely conservative narratives. But, in some instances, it can also point us towards more radical ideas. For example, tradition can help foster a connection to the land, by which I mean the actual soil — something that has become revolutionary again today since it runs counter to so many globalized forces.”
Still, as we discuss how to synthesize such opposing views, it seems fitting that we end our conversation on the subject of land. After all, street artists are ever-rooted to their physical surroundings. And so we conclude by returning to the city of Athens one final time, with Alexandros saying, “In so many places in the West, public space is tightly regulated: you go to your work and after you go to designated places to enjoy yourself in very predetermined ways (bar, restaurant, theater). In between, public space is used only as a passage, with few actions produced there. But in the words Martyn Reed, I like to think of streets as ‘repositories of meaning for those who occupy and move through them, as places of contested perceptions and negotiated understanding.’ We can see this in Athens, where public space is chaotic and put under many competing demands. People, bikes, cars, and café tables fight over finite space. It’s not always pleasant, but I love the plethora of communication that happens in these increasingly squeezed plots of land. It excites me to see Athenians using every bit of public space available to them; you find people everywhere. The city’s residents continue to spend a large amount of time outside, together. Here, there is an intensity of community that I don’t find in other cities in Europe or the United States. For me, that’s the essential quality of Athens, that’s a big part of what makes it special.”

Monastiraki square — another very central area of Athens.
Athens is an absolutely marvelous place, no doubt about it. We thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit and definitely plan on going back at some point in the future. Nonetheless, it is not a perfect place. No place in the world is. I have alluded to the three sides on our postcard post, but l will delve into it a little more. As tourists, we often gloss over the great parts of a place and rarely see the true local side of said place. It’s understandable, after all, you’re on vacation and world problems should not be on your mind. Regular readers know l try to present what l see in all its glory, and crappiness, This will be no exception. I present to you our observations of the amazing city.
Syntagma square is one of Athens top tourist attractions, where it all happens…both good and bad!
Athens is the capital of Greece with a population of just over 11 million people, so yes…very crowded. The heart of the city is Syntagma (Constitution) Square. It is definitely the most famous part of Athens. It is a lively part of town. The Parliament building is located here. Once upon a time, it used to be the King’s Palace. Built between 1836 and 1840 by King Otto, who had daddy (Ludwig I of Bavaria) pay for it. Fun fact: The original plan had been to build the King’s palace on the Acropolis! Thank god it never came to pass. Can you imagine tearing down that history to put up a dime a dozen palace? Syntagma Square is where all the protests and parties (New Year’s Eve etc) happens. Among the government buildings, there are tons of shops and cafes.
Athens sightseeing: Parliament House Syntagma square Athens — the changing of the guards should be on your Athens itinerary.
Here’s a video l did on the changing of the guard, a fun thing to see in Athens. Sorry for the shaky hand in the beginning, but l rarely do this :-). I love how they imitate the movement of horses.
What to do in Athens : Try both Traditional and otherwise food and expand your palette.
It is hard not to eat well. The food is hearty and delicious. We had lots of really good traditional food. We had an amazing foodie tour and we sampled lots of coffee drinks that we enjoyed thoroughly.
Some of the yummy goodies we hate. I have had my fill of Greek salads for a while though :-)
I have never been a huge fan of drinking to excess or pub crawling, but l do enjoy a good glass of wine or cocktail. The area of Athens we stayed at, called Psyrri, is a bohemian and artsy neighborhood. About a 20–30 minute walk from Syntagma square. Iroon square, which is the very heart of the neighborhood, has tons of eateries with live music, and lots of bars. I mean bars with proper tables and chairs with dark interiors and great music. I confess l don’t know what they become after 11 or so because l am in bed :-), but during the day, they are wonderful to hang out in. Some had Greek music, some jazz, my favorite were the ones with bossa nova music. We actually went pub crawling, going from one to the next, having coffee drinks (mostly Federico) and cocktails (mostly me). Absolutely loved it.
Simple, good food. Stewed meat and white rice. We found a little place run by a girl and the grandmother with an all Greek menu and l just explained that l wanted something simple and she gave me this. I was licking the bowl :-)
Non touristy things to do in Athens :-) . So many cool cafes and bars to sit, people watch and listen to good music. I had so many good margaritas too!
If you ever have a chance to eat the orange pie on the right, go for it. It is amazing. The one on the left was like pudding. I didn’t like it, but ate it because the woman insisted on comping us, and l couldn’t be rude! :-)
Visit Athens and try the yummy kinds of food everywhere!
Pork belly, grilled..served with homemade chips. Food sampling is definitely one of the best things to do in Athens. The flavors and spices are awesome.
We found cute little off the wall places to eat, everything from kebabs to gyros. I can’t remember eating anything bad. The fact that the prices were reasonable was an added bonus.
This super friendly guy insisted on Federico taking his picture when he saw the camera and started talking to us.
The people were very friendly, warm and smiled a lot. Everyone was eager to help when we got lost, sometimes even walking us to the metro station. It was pleasant haggling with the traders, they weren’t aggressive like in Marakesh, which was a nightmare for Federico, but fun for me..felt just like home!
Remains of the Roman Agora Athens, built during the Roman period in Plaka Athens
Greek mythology is alive and well. Being able to see where it all began is a joy. If you can afford it, I think everyone should visit Athens at least once in their lifetime. Sightseeing in Athens is mind blowing. Places such as the:
Acropolis Athens night view. Amazing sight! The Acropolis is probably one of the top things to do in Greece, if not the top.
You don’t see sights like this ancient columns everyday! Well, unless you’re in Athens Greece of course :-) Part of the Roman Agora in Plaka Athens
Some of the best things to see in Athens include: (Things to do in Athens Greece)
Athens tourist attractions: If you’re looking for Athens tours, we recommend GetYourGuide tours, which we have personally used on our trips.
Places to visit in Athens Greece include the Tower of the Winds in Athens Greece. It has stood at the bottom of the Acropolis for over 2,000 years. It was used by merchants to forecast the weather.
It seems like there is a temple dedicated to every Greek god! :-) . This time around, we didn’t really seek them out much as l’d already visited them on my first trip to Athens.
Things to see in Athens: Great street art that one can appreciate.
Street art depiction of the stray Riot dog Loukanikos who always sided with the protesters against the police. He was actually one of Time magazine’s people of the year 2011. He died in 2014 :-(
This is good stuff :-) . What to do in Greece? definitely look for street art. There are some great ones.
When they’re good, they’re very good. We found some great street art in Athens in the neighborhood of Psyrri, right off the main square. There are some very talented artists.
Athens weather is pretty good year round. There are few days of rain and the average temperature is 84 degrees which is quite nice. August is the hottest month to visit Athens. In the winter, the temperature drops to about 59–62 degrees which is still hot for some. Weather in Greece in October is about 74 degrees and October, along with April seems to be the best times to visit Athens.
The two often go hand in hand l know. It’s hard not to notice the increased number of drug addicts that are in Athens. Eating outside on the sidewalk is a thing in Europe. Neither one of us like this. The sidewalks are often dirty and l hate people passing by peering at my food, dogs sniffing and doing their business or peeing in front of me, and boy..the sidewalks are dirty and stink! (worse in Spain). Probably the biggest reason is my fear of cats! They are freaking everywhere. I will overturn the table if one gets close! :-) Anyway, we prefer to eat inside. Sometimes, depending on how the exterior seating is, we will seat outside and have drinks. This really gave me a chance to observe just how rampant the drug use is. We saw at least 5 separate instances where drug abusers were tweaking and it brought back nasty memories of my pharmacy years. Tweaking is when meth users (tweakers) become unpredictable, paranoid, and might be dangerous, usually at the end of a drug binge. One woman was screaming because she felt something/someone was hurting her, was scratching herself furiously and taking off her clothes as she walked, all her teeth were rotten. A man was trying to calm her down, but he looked almost in the same sad shape. Another time, a man in a red shirt was in a fit, just rolling on the floor and yelling angrily, and went about punching the tree shrubs, he was quite close to the diners. I was a bit scared honestly. I notice though, that the employees come out in full force, to gawk, and also probably to make sure that their clients are not disturbed, which is kind of re-assuring. We didn’t take any pictures because l really don’t care to showcase human despair.
This is just off the main square. You can see the beginning of the sleeping bags, further down, it’s narrower and we walked on the street instead.
I also noticed that quite a few of the cafes feed the homeless. I actually mentioned it to Federico after l saw it a couple of times and we made sure to eat again at the places we noticed did that. The homeless people would stand at a particular spot and wait. When the waitress/waiter had a spare minute, she would bring out food for them, they would take it, and go away..well, all except for this one guy, she gave him a sandwich and he defiantly refused to leave. He just stood there eating. Now, this guy looked like a hobo, matted hair, torn clothes and l’m sure smelled badly. We weren’t very close to him, but l could tell it was disturbing to the nearest diners. She called another waitress who came out and talked to the guy firmly in an angry and raised voice which made him finally leave. It’s so sad to see, and while l feel sorry for them, I just would rather not be exposed to that. If that makes me an cold unfeeling twat, then so be it. I think it’s just a part of everyday life and people just get used to it, but it’s jarring for visitors to Athens.
Lots of fun stores can be found at the flea market. Consider it a must visit in Athens.
I had previously mentioned the high amount of homeless people that were sleeping in the doorways of houses in the area where we stayed. There were also lots of homeless sleeping in the nearby parks. I can only imagine how much worse the refugees have it as this was mostly a locals area. We saw people sleeping during the day in the porticoes just off the beautiful Monastiraki square. I assume the situation is only going to get worse.
This is just bad crappy doodling!
Unfortunately, there’s more crap than good stuff. This was an old historic theater that the government doesn’t have money to fix, refuse to sell it and is left to rot.
When they’re bad, they are simply horrible! Does this look good to anyone except to someone in a drug induced haze? They cover the houses, stores and streets with it. The same can be said for a great part of Spain, and l think it’s terrible too. I’m not sure when defamation became art :-)!
What happens to most of the refugees fleeing war torn countries that end up in Athens? A bleak life with no end in sight. Syntagma square for all its beauty, also has a dark side. A side where these young men turn to prostitution to survive. It’s so disheartening to read these stories. Here is a video that does a better job than me of showing you how things are that l watched recently. These boys are trapped in a world where the only way to survive is to become male hustlers. We were told by both our host and our food guide to stay away from Omonia Square (this article made me aware of that before we arrived) especially at night because it’s ground zero. We took the advice.
A quick Google search will bring you tons of stories on how hard life is for these young boy. It’s a growing problem. When a 16 year old says he wished he could die that very night because he has no future and his advice to future refugees? Don’t come. It’s better to stay and live with the war. They keep getting younger too. We hear about the girls, but the boys are caught up in the same vicious cycle.
Of course you should! The beauty and the history alone should make you want to visit, not to mention the people. Once again, no place is perfect. It’s no different than any city in America with the drug abuse and prostitution. Would you not visit New York because of Times Square? Thankfully, unlike the U.S, the people in Athens don’t carry guns. Tourism, apart from shipping, is the biggest money maker for the country. After a devastating economic downturn, the country is slowly recovering and they need that money. There are so many cities and islands to visit in this diverse country, you’re bound to find someplace you’ll love, like Heraklion , Crete where we spent some time and had a fantastic time. We spent a total of 15 days in Greece on our holiday and are eager for more. Is Athens worth visiting? The answer is a resounding yes! There are so many things to do in Athens.
Where to stay in Athens Greece — We stayed in Pysrri and we really liked it. It is funky, bohemian and artsy. We stayed at this AirBnB studio flat which was very central and had a stunning view of the Acropolis. My only complaint would be the bathroom which is tiny, but apart from that, it was spotlessly clean, had everything you needed. The WiFi was super fast and the A/C was insanely efficient. Feel free to use our referral code to get some $ off your first stay if you’re new to the platform. I don’t know if it’s the best place to stay in Athens, but we really liked it and would stay there again.
Have you been to Athens? or any other part of Greece? What were your observations? Did you see the good, the bad or the ugly side of Athens?

Even the second time that I went to Athens I was totally fascinated!
I am one of those strange people who didn’t only have Latin at school but Ancient Greek as well. It wasn’t because I really wanted to learn that language. Nope, I just completely refused to learn French when I had to decide between those two languages. So I started learning Ancient Green when I was 14.
I think it was in 2004 when we did a two-weeks-trip to Greece with all my class mates that had chosen as well to study Ancient Greek. By bus we went through Austria and Italy to Ancona and took a ship that would bring us over night to Patras. It was so exciting!
The trip obviously included a stop in Athens! We couldn’t leave out the capital of the new and the ancient Greece.
When I was standing at the Acropolis for the second time — 29, two university degrees and living the digital nomad lifestyle- I couldn’t help but seeing my 17 year old me — super blond and a real rebel. I remember well how we were standing in sun, sweating and listing to the tour guide. I could almost see myself standing infront of the Erechtheion — with hurting feet from all the walking, unpatient but curious at the same time.
It was a strange feeling to stand in front of the Parthenon again and to think about what happened since last time 12 years back in time. My last years at school, the 7 years studying at university and my life as a digital nomad, a life of travels and with my work as a travel blogger.
The weekend in Athens after my week on Coboat turned out to make me travel through time twice!
Because at the same time I was trying to remember all the details of what I learned during my studies of Archeology at school and at university where I studied it as a minor subject.
So I was standing at the Acropolis with my dear nomad friends Anca and Adrian and they wanted to know more about the history of this place. It turned out that the signs weren’t really helpful since they wouldn’t explain the technical terms. That’s why I started explaining:
Although the settlements started in the New Stone Age (around 7500 BC), Athens had the time of prosperity just during the Classical Antiquity in the 5th and 4th Century BC. When Socrates and Platon were strolling over the Acropolis, the ago of the philosophers, artists and thinkers.
“Acropolis” means nothing else than “high city” and during the ancient times every city needed to have one. The Acropolis of Athens though became kind of the symbol of all acropolises. That’s why people always think of the Acropolis of Athens if you just talk about the acropolis. It’s World Heritage of the UNESCO.
In the center of attention of the Acropolis of Athens is the most important temple — the Parthenon, the sanctuary of the patron saint and goddess Pallas Athena Parthenos. It got destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC and they Greeks needed to rebuild it. Since then it had a 12 meters statue of Athena, made of gold and ivory. Unfortunately she got destroyed in the 6th Century.
I remember very well how Mister Herr Krauskopf — my Ancient Greek teacher at school — repeated as often as possible:
“Whenever something could lost or destroyed, we still have our dear old friend Pausanias, who is describing in his travel books all the art works and places that he saw — in an extremely detailed manner which is almost bringing them back to life.”
That’s why we know even today how the statue of Pallas Athene in the inside of the Parthenon looked like:
„The statue is created with ivory and gold. On the middle of her helmet is likeness of the Sphinx … and on either side of the helmet are griffins in relief. … The statue of Athena is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory. She holds a statue of Victory that is approx. Four cubits high, and in the other hand a spear; at her feet lies a shield and near the spear is a serpent. This serpent would be Erichthonius. On the pedestal is the birth of Pandora in relief.“
Pausanias
When I am at those kind of places with a lot of history, I can’t help myself but touching the things, closing my eyes and imagining what this column, this wall or this building has seen and lived. I imagine what story from ancient times it would whisper if it could.
I did that in Palenque for example. Between the many trees and the half covered Maya ruins I really needed to do that. Do you know that feeling?
I remembered the entrance to be on the other side. In my memory we have seen the Theatre of Dyonisos in the end and not in the beginning.
I tried to remember what I had learned: The Theatre of Dionysos was the birthplace of theatre in general. This is where the greek tragedies of Sophocles, Aeschylos and Euripides had there premieres. I was telling Anca and Adrian about Dionysos, the god of plays and wine, and about the theatre’s function of the catharsis, a purification.
I translated them es well words like Stoa into understandable English. I couldn’t believe that signs said those terms without explaining the meaning. So everybody knows what a Stoa is? People are supposed to know that it was nothing than a big hall or a walkway surrounded by columns in the very beginning. I explained Anca and Adrian that later the school of Stoicism was founded in the Stoa in Athens wich is why their name derives from the word Stoa. The reason is because they met here talking about their philosophical ideas.That’s why later a Stoa wasn’t only considered a walkway with columns but a school like place to learn and study philosophy.
I simply enjoyed the rest of the Acropolis with the temples, columns and steles and just tried to let this experience sink. That’s why I want to invite you to do the same with showing you the photos.
In the end, just some minutes before it was time to go back to the modern city and to the here and now, I took the time to admire the beautiful view and landscape.
That’s how my trip through the time in Europe’s oldest capital ended and how I got back to the year 2016. In a certain way it was a catharsis in the sense of a purification while seeing a greek tragedy Although I traveled through the time only in my head. Nevertheless I grew a bit in those few hours!
Did you ever travel through time while being on the road? I am looking forward to your answers!
P.S.: if you liked this article, have a look at the Barbaralicious publication or my blog at Barbaralicious.com (in German as well as in English). A like or comment also helps me a lot in keeping track on what you — my readers like! I hope you have an amazing day and enjoy your next travels.

Clearly Athens has been going through it as of late. The 2009 financial crisis and the subsequent underthought austerity measures put in place by the IMF crippled the country’s economy, and hit its capital hard. Due to this, things got cheaper for foreigners, and huge amount of tourists and investors were flooding the place before the COVID pandemic; apparently this improved things a bit, but tourism definitely brings its own headaches. And, as I write this, some of its suburbs just stopped burning.
So yes, Athens is pretty screwed up right now. However, things are bad in the sense that they were in New York in the late 70s, or in East Berlin after the wall came down: this economic suffering has coincided with Athens becoming a rare, rare beast. Rent is cheap, and so is the food (which is, clearly, Greek, a great cuisine); additionally, it’s safe. All this adds up to major appeal for a certain group: artists.
On the streets, the graffiti scene is very, very strong: by many accounts, Athens is an urban gallery (there’s a documentary about the scene, albeit from 2014, here). It’s also an amazing place for skateboarding, with a grip of skate spots and its hilly terrain, which has provided the skate community with a lot of videos and travel writeups about the place. On the other side of the coin, there…

The Story of the World’s Greatest Civilization
My fascination with Greek culture started in middle school. I don’t remember much from that time of my life, but I do remember the weeks we spent learning about Greek mythology. The Titans. The Gods. The Olympians. The Greeks.
That led me to Rick Riordan and one of the best book series’ I’ve ever read: Percy Jackson. Those books, and the topic of the Greek gods, were what interested me in reading, and writing for that matter. I have a draft sitting in my room of a 50,000-word Greek mythology novel. It’s not good, but I’m getting closer to scratching that itch. For whatever reason, I am drawn to the Greeks and the mythology that was created.
From there it was books from the likes of Madeline Miller and the stories of Odysseus and Achilles. Late last year I read a book from Christopher McDougall (famous for writing Born to Run) called Natural Born Heroes. The book jumped all over the place, but its central plot was about the Greek Island Crete during World War II. The stores, and the characters in them, read like a Greek tragedy. It read like a story in the Iliad or the Odyssey.
This book re-sparked my interest in the Greeks. My interest shifted away from the mythology of the Greeks to the culture of the Greeks. How is it, more than 2,000 years later, we still read and learn from that ancient civilization? I became more interested in what our modern day societies have taken from the Greeks. Reading The Perfect Mile made me reflect on the Olympic Games and how that was made famous because of the Greeks.
I started to dig deeper and found this book my Anthony Everitt. He specializes in these ancient cultures, having already read a few of his Rome books. This book, The Rise of Athens, at more than 400 pages was daunting, but I was surprised at how willing I was to come back to the book each time I put it down.
For the book you are going to have to enjoy Greek culture. But more than that, you are going to have to be interested in the beginning foundations of Greece. The mythology that surrounds its founding is blended in reality and even the great historians like Plutarch don’t differentiate the two.
The book focused on the politics and wars. It chronicled the rise of democracy and the Persian and Peloponnese wars. It brought the Hellenic world to life.
It was a difficult book to read. Almost all of it went over my head. Most of my enjoyment came from knowing even one or two of the characters (outside of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle).
The book focused on the creation of democracy, Greek warfare, life in the Mediterranean in the fourth-century. It examined the architecture and cultural center of Athens and its vast difference from Sparta.
Though the book was a bit more advanced for me, or at least of my understanding of the Greek world during this time, the ideas and information I did understand was valuable. The book was called the Rise of Athens, the Story of the Worlds Greatest Civilization. The objective of Everitt was to answer the question of how Athens became that Great civilization. Unless I missed a whole lot, after reading, Athens really didn’t seem all that great. The democracy lasted less then 200 years and were conquered by Alexander the Great shortly after.
The power of this book is that I have the ability to read the words of these ancient leaders. These are the same words that leaders from the time of Alexander the Great through the founding fathers of America have read. It’s little wonder America looks so similar to Greece and Rome. It’s because those men who created this government were so enamored with those cultures. They breathed new life into them in the creation of America. Understanding our founding, but also the founding of a lot of the knowledge we have built upon today, was worth the effort of this book.

Here’s what you need to know if you’re thinking about taking on a real bucket-list marathon race and running the original, Athens Authentic Marathon!
A year later than initially planned, I got to run the 38th Athens Authentic Marathon. It’s known as the ‘Authentic Marathon’ as it follows the fabled route of Greek messenger Philippides, who ran to the town of Marathon and back to Athens to bring news of a Greek battle victory against Persia, dying after he’d relayed the news.
Gladly, I only ran this route one-way and I’m still alive to tell the tale, so if you’re thinking about running the Athens Authentic Marathon in the future, here’s what you can expect.
You’ll discover to expect at the expo, how the race unfolds on the day and an overview my own race strategy that brought me a new personal best and my first ever time qualifier result.
But first, let’s get started by looking at the pre-race organisation.
The first thing you’ll notice when you start to check-out the information online about the Athens Authentic Marathon is that the quality is rather poor.
The Athens Authentic Marathon website is dated and doesn’t work well on mobile. The content is also usually out of date, with information about previous runnings easily available but little to nothing about the upcoming event. It also doesn’t help that there are several other events that share the same website, so you’ll frequently find information about the half marathon, 10k and 5k races taking place around the same time as the marathon.
It’s rather frustrating.
The social media accounts aren’t much better. They’re basically dormant until a few weeks before the race, then burst into action covering all the ribbon-cutting, permit-acquiring activities runners really couldn’t care less about. Like the website, the socials were also extremely poor.
But, on the day of the Athens Authentic Marathon itself, the organisation was perfect.
I took one of the coaches to Marathon departing from Syntagma and had zero problems. There must’ve been 20–30 coaches lined up, and when the front coach was full (or full-ish) it pulled away.
After arriving at the starting point in Marathon, it was a short walk to the stadium and a 90-minute wait until the race got underway. So as on-the-day organisation goes, there was zero anxiety. It’s just a shame that level of organisation and reassurance wasn’t present on the website and socials in the build up to the race.
This was the first Athens Authentic Marathon since COVID-19 struck so unsurprisingly there were changes from previous runnings and additional protocols in place.
At the time of running, Greece was experiencing a surge in COVID-19 case numbers so everywhere you went shops and restaurants were very hot on mask-wearing and COVID-19 certificates to prove you’re either fully vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 or have a recent negative COVID-19 test (even to the extent of having to show a vaccine certificate and wear a mask to enter a cheap souvenir store!). At the marathon expo, you had to show your vaccine status (or other acceptable status) to enter, and you had to wear a mask while you were inside.
Masks had to be worn on the coach from Athens to Marathon on the day of the race, and the coaches left sufficient room for social distancing by departing when they were probably around 60% full.
Marathon Stadium is all open air, so there was no need to wear masks while you were there, and this year there was a staggered start over two ‘races’ and eight waves, which gave space between blocks of runners. That said, the start wave had zero social distancing and even with the best attempts of the marshals, not everyone maintained a safe distance while waiting for the starting pistol…
And speaking of waves, each wave set off about three minutes after the previous one, so as I was in Wave 3, I was over the start line by about 09:06.
I was running with a friend who was much faster than me and he was placed in Wave 1. There was a lot of very strict communication about not being able to change waves, but we managed to get it sorted at the expo so he could start with me in Wave 3. Apparently, your timing chip was calibrated to activate according to your wave start time, so, if you started in a different wave, your time wouldn’t be recorded.
Overall, the COVID-19 arrangements felt safe and proportionate and in line with what everyone else was doing in Greece at the time.
The Athens Marathon expo — known as the Ergo Marathon Expo — is located at the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre (previously known at the Taekwondo Centre). It’s south of the city on the coast and makes for a nice day out to watch the sailing after you’ve collected your bib.
As the expo was a straight line walk from our apartment, we decided to take an easy stroll to the exhibition centre, which was about 4km away and all downhill. It was a lovely walk and excellent weather, but when we saw the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre we literally ran out of road — several busy motorways and lots of excavation sat between us and the expo hall with no obvious way of crossing them.
We ran into a group of Greek guys who were also on their way there, but even they didn’t know which way to go! After about a kilometre detour, we eventually ended up on the correct side of the motorways and got into the expo after showing our vaccine certificates.
Picking up our race packs was quick and easy, you just had to show your confirmation email and photographic ID. We also managed to sort running in the same wave together, which was also very easy. My friend had the back of his bib signed and stamped to show he’d been approved to run in a different wave, while his registration was updated as well so that his timing chip would work in Wave 3.
The expo offerings were pretty good, with two floors of stalls and very well attended, even if the official marathon stall was pretty small (about 30sq m) and running low on stocks of small and medium merchandise.
We spent around 45 minutes at the expo, which was enough, then grabbed some lunch before heading back into the City Centre.
On race day, it was a fairly early start as the coaches to Marathon began leaving from various points throughout Athens at 05:30, with the last coach scheduled to depart around 06:15. There were dozens of coaches lined up near Syntagma where we boarded our coach, so it was very quick and easy to get on the transport.
And even though it was before sunrise on a Sunday, the Greek parliament guards were still doing their routines, and with only a handful of runners around it was an excellent opportunity to take photos or a short video!
On the coach, there was an information tape playing, explaining in Greek and English what to expect, as well as giving a little history behind the race. So by the time you reached Marathon about 45 minute later, you’re fully briefed and raring to go.
Marathon Stadium is the ‘start village’ for the race and is virtually all outdoors. There is a small indoor area at the back, but unless you were queuing for toilets you were ‘strongly advised’ to go outside (COVID, and everything…).
The stadium itself is a bit run down but there was plenty of room, and if you arrived early enough, you could get a cheeky Strava Segment in round the running track.
There were dozens of toilets and portaloos everywhere round the stadium, so you never had to queue long for the toilet (although some did… while others decided to go al fresco…). Free water and bananas were available so you could keep fluid and carb levels topped up.
The Olympic Flame is also at Marathon Stadium, and if you time it right you can go and hold the torch. Unfortunately, we were in our start pen by then so could only look on in envy.
Running the Athens Marathon requires planning for three very different sections, which I’ll refer to as the First Half, the Hill and the End Bit. While it frustrated me a lot planning my race strategy, as conventional wisdom is to run even or negative splits that just aren’t feasible on this course, it made for a very exciting race in the end.
And don’t read the map left-to-right like a lot of people mistakenly do — the route starts in the east and heads south then west into Athens, not the other way round!
The Athens Authentic Marathon has one of the highest elevation gains of any major international marathon, with a total of 332m (1,089ft) elevation gain across its 26.2 miles. Most of that elevation gain comes in a brutal 8-mile section that begins about halfway through the race and continues relentlessly until you pass kilometre marker 31 (about 19.5 miles in).
But the good news is that the rest of the race — the End Bit — is virtually all downhill, including one of the most charitable last 800m I’ve ever experienced at a race.
After the 5km mark there are water stations every 2.5km in line with international race standards, as well as frequent toilet stops and aid stations. So from a provisions perspective, it was extremely well appointed.
The first half of the Athens Authentic Marathon is pretty much flat. There are a couple of minor climbs, but these only last for a few hundred metres, so they can be safely taken at a constant pace.
After leaving Marathon Stadium the route is fairly straight, save for a dog-legged detour about 5km around the Marathon Tomb. On the wide-open road — made less congested by the staggered start waves — it was easy to find a comfortable pace and lock it in, following the blue racing line as closely as I could.
I even made a friend during this section, getting to chat to a Greek guy who was aiming for a similar finish time to me. So it was nice to be able to chat while grinding down the miles.
The support through this section is sporadic as the setting is quite rural, but when you run through a village there’s a massive surge in energy as the whole place seemed to be out supporting the runners. There were also children and ladies handing out olive twigs for luck, so I took a small one and stuffed it into my pocket. It was a unique souvenir for a finish line selfie!
About halfway, The Hill starts. I clocked it starting at 13.5 miles, and it went on for the next 8 miles with only a couple of short sections flattening out a little.
I was nervous about The Hill, even though I’d trained on a lot of hills back home and had simulated an 8-mile, 180m (580ft) elevation gain run a few weeks earlier. But I’d never attempted something like this after running a fairly pacy (for me!) half marathon beforehand.
My coach had recommended I do ‘something’ while running up the hill to take my mind off it. ‘Counting to four’ and ‘pretending to click pens with my thumbs’ were two techniques he suggested had been shown to take the mind off pain, so I planned to give them a go. The ‘count to four’ suggestion fit well with a breathing technique Jack Daniels, PhD recommends of using two strides to breathe out and a two strides to breathe in.
So I applied the ‘count to four’ and breathing technique for a good part of The Hill, but also took the opportunity to learn a bit of Greek from my Greek running friend. I learned how to say ‘thank you’ (‘Efharisto’ or Ευχαριστώ) and tried it out on the crowds, with him correcting my terrible pronunciation so I could try again later.
I think I got it in the end!
For all the worry I had about The Hill beforehand, it turned out to be absolutely manageable. My highest elevation gain over one mile was 138ft (42m), but most miles had an elevation gain of just 50–60ft (15–18m).
My race strategy worked a treat through this section and I was actually ahead of schedule by the time The Hill ended at kilometre marker 31… but not before the most brutal segment, where you run down — and then back up — a motorway fly-under, which was a killer. But once you’re over the top, the road bends to the left and you can see it’s all downhill from now on.
At this point in the race, more than 20 miles in and knowing the hardest part was probably over, it was a bizarre feeling. But I’d had some sage advice from people who’d ran the Athens Authentic Marathon before, who told me:
Don’t put your foot down too quickly after the top of The Hill as many people who do this end up collapsing
After running uphill for so many miles, the sudden change in terrain puts a strain on different muscle groups as you head downhill, and for many people their knees just give way, and they collapse. After running so closely to my race plan up until this point, the last thing I wanted was to put my foot down too hard and fall over, so I gave it half a mile or so before increasing my pace.
The End Bit isn’t all downhill, there are flat sections and a sneaky incline just before the final turn, but the support really ramps up to cheer you on. Entering Athens was an incredible buzz, with massive support either side of the course and a lot more cheer stations as well.
And after that last turn, it’s another downhill segment straight into the Panathenaic Stadium and finish line. This must be one of the most charitable ends to any race I’ve ever ran as you can give it all you’ve got left without worrying about making it up another hill or round a tight bend.
It was fantastic!
And ending in the Panathenaic Stadium — location of the first Modern Olympic Games in 1896 — really is something to behold. And you’ll want your best smile/ grimace on as you enter the stadium as the finish straight is littered with photographers snapping away at your sprint finish.
Then it’s time to grab your medal — the 38th running has a fabulous double-sided medallion with Philippides on one side and the Panathenaic Stadium track on the other.
I can honestly say this race is up there with the very best, a cracking course and an exceptional finish line. I’d do it again without hesitation!
Coming back to my race strategy, I’d pondered it for months as The Hill means you must adapt your race plan from what would be considered ‘best practice’. Running even splits isn’t possible on this course as the elevation changes so vastly, while keeping your powder dry for later in the race seems like a waste considering the first half is flat as a pancake and you’ve got the benefit of miles of downhill segments at the end to sweep you through to the finish line.
My target was a Chicago Marathon time qualifier time, so I needed to come in sub-3:20.
I’d also ran a PB in a virtual marathon the previous year in 3:18, so my goals for Athens were to nail a Chicago Marathon time qualifier spot and, if possible, chalk up a new personal best. This meant my goal pace was about 7:34 mins/ mile over the marathon distance, but even splits were out of the question due to the 180m (560ft) of elevation on the 8-mile stretch of The Hill.
I didn’t know how much The Hill was going to take out of me, so I set a pace range for the last 5–6 miles, knowing if I was in that ballpark I’d hit my goal.
My race strategy looked like this:
· First Half: 7:00 mins/ mile
· The Hill: 7:30 to 7:45 mins/ mile
· The End Bit: whatever I had left in the tank, but as close to 7:00 mins/ mile as I could manage
This left quite a bit of wiggle room at the end as I knew I’d tire but didn’t know by how much.
The First Half went 100% to plan, I maintained a steady 7:00 mins/ mile throughout (even having to pull back my pacer friend at times to stop me from running too fast!) and hit The Hill bang on target.
To my utter amazement, The Hill turned out to be a lot kinder than I’d anticipated. I managed to hold a 7:20 mins/ mile pace for large portions of it, slowing only to 7:45 mins/ mile for the really steep sections, which were thankfully few and far between.
And for the End Bit, I managed to pull back to 7:00 mins/ mile for a couple of miles before fatigue set in and I dropped back to 7:30 mins/ mile. But hitting that last 800m downhill home stretch I accelerated to 6:45 mins/ mile to cross the finish line, which shows you just how charitable that last segment is!
I finished in a time of 3:08:31, way ahead of both my goals. My time was also a Boston Qualifier time and would’ve got me into the 2022 running but unfortunately the Athens Authentic Marathon was 48 hours after the close of the Boston Marathon qualifying period.
But there’s always another chance to improve my time and get that BQ next year!
I can honestly say this was one of the best races I’ve ever experienced. The course was incredible, gave you lots to think about and was an energising mix of quieter segments followed by raucous support as you ran through the towns and villages — and then Athens itself.
If this race is on your bucket list, I’d highly recommend signing up and living your dream.
You won’t be disappointed!

What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.
— Attributed to Pericles, 5th Century BCE
Ancient Athens is often referred to as the birthplace of Western thought. Whilst we have a lot to thank the Athenians for in terms of the invention of education as we know it, critical thinking, science, democracy, technology and architecture, everyday life looked a lot different back then. There were vast inequalities depending on gender, political and economic standing, for one only free men were classed as citizens, with females and slaves living a much more restrictive life.
In this article, we’ll delve into what life would have looked like as an inhabitant of Athens, in terms of their occupation; diet; how they socialised; where they lived and what family life looked like.
Athens, as a thriving and bustling coastal city boasted a vast array of different occupations of all skill sets and familial backgrounds. From high ranking jobs in the military, philosophical tutors, local government officials to the less well paying jobs such as fishing, farming and everything in between. Many made their living through the marketplace- the…

It takes place in silence, mainly as the people who are supposed to safeguard it remain too preoccupied to see what’s going on.
And that is the bitter lesson of Ancient Athens. Now America is suffering from the same blind spots.
It’s history repeating itself and rhyming with a harsh cadence.
Here’s why two democracies, old and new, might be more alike than we realize.
Athens made something radical: a body of language nobody on this planet had ever seen or heard.. government of the people, by the people.
Voting assemblies. Citizen juries. Laws that treated everybody the same, that is, at least if you were male and free.
By today’s standards it was not fair but it was a beginning.
Like America’s beginning wasn’t perfect — but it was constructed to get better.
Both systems were built on faith as much as bricks.. after people stopped caring, everything wobbled.
Lowerclass Athenians were given a voice by Pericles, who paid them to serve. That widened access.
But what it opened is the door to louder voices, not smarter ones.
As the conversation of leaders descended the crowd was humored.
Applause lines started wars. Justice was about winning a popularity contest.
It was all spectacle. And spectacle requires a villain.
America’s founders were obsessed with history.
They saw what had gone wrong in Athens and tried to slow things down through checks, balances and staggered elections.
The system functioned when people believed in it.
And now the crack is beginning to show in the walls.. Rules that are not violated but rejected.
There’s a rhythm to the drift of democracies. The lyrics are different, but the chorus strikes the same chords.
Athenian Breakdown
American Parallel
These are not symptoms in isolation. They’re a trendline.
Although this time around Athens surrendered to oligarchs after losing a war.
The Thirty Tyrants ruled brutal and short-lived, but that’s all.
The people fought back. Democracy returned.
But it limped.. not marched. What came back wasn’t what it was.
Athens was then given a second chance. It simply wasn’t strong enough for them.
There aren’t any mobs storming the assembly with swords.
No decrees, no coups..just slowbmotion neglect.
Democracy crumbles not when buildings fall in one big blow but when cracks are left unfixed.
And the tools to repair it aren’t glamorous. They’re tedious. Uncelebrated. Necessary.
Athens didn’t fail because it was flawed.
It dropped because too many trusted that it wouldn’t.
America has its warnings. They’re loud.
The resolution depends on whether we are listening to them or are the ones scrolling past.

Talking with User Interface & User Experience Designers

--
Listen
Share
Matt D. Smith is the owner and Design Director at Studio Mds, a small independent design studio in Athens, GA. He created the Float Label Pattern for digital form input fields, which is now a design standard in Google’s Material Design Guidelines. He’s a proud father of four and has led creative work for agencies and brands in the US and Singapore including NBC, AT&T, Sprint, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Dwell, Razorfish, Sapient and more.
When your friends or parents ask to you what job do you do, how do you answer?
I tell them I’m a designer and work mostly on websites and mobile apps. Everyone knows what those things are so this answer proves most digestible for a layman.
What is your background, how did you train?
I was always drawing when I was a kid. In college I gravitated towards drawing and painting and eventually made my way into the Graphic Design department at the University of Georgia. There I learned a lot of the fundamentals of design–typography, white space, color, contrast, etc. After graduating I got heavily involved in the Flash community and taught myself Actionscript 2.0. This sparked my passion for digital design.
What the web can do to make this world a better place? How did the web improve your life( if it did)?
The web can’t do anything on its own–it needs people. It’s a powerful tool to connect humans all over the world around a specific thing. The possibilities are endless.
Can you show us three examples of interface that in your opinion improved human life?
“Improving human life” is definitely subjective depending on whom you ask. I’d say a few that make my life easier are iMessage, Fantastical, and Dropbox. iMessage for short specific bursts of communication. Fantastical for its natural language input to create events. And finally, Dropbox that reliably keeps all of my digital stuff wherever I go.
On quora.com, time ago there was a long discussion in answer to the question “what is the most intuitive interface ever created?”; according to Felipe Rocha it is the nipple, in your opinion instead? (http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-intuitive-interfaces-ever-created)
Hmm, maybe fruit. It appeals to most of your senses–sight, smell, feel, taste. It serves a core human need, hunger. It’s also nutritious. =)
How is your work day type?
I get into work around 8 AM and try to write first thing in the morning before email, jumping into design, or anything else. From then on until around 5pm, it’s design, emails, etc. all day.
What is the most stimulating and challenging project you have accomplished?
The most challenging project I’ve worked on so far has been Shiplify, a commercial transportation management system. There are huge amounts of information along with the constraint of a mobile device that really leveled up my thinking and skills.
What is, among the existing digital services, the one you wanted to do?
Hah, I’m still trying to figure that out.
Many designers commit the mistake of starting a project directly from Photoshop, is there a perfect design method? What is your approach to the creative process?
Starting in Photoshop is a good way to create art, but not solve a problem. The more experience I gain as a designer, the more time I wait before jumping into a design. I start with lots and lots of questions about the problem we’re trying to solve and why.
The “design” is an important part of our analogic life. What is the role of the designer in our digital life?
The core role of the designer hasn’t changed much from analog to digital. It remains to communicate visually. The trick is to find out what you’re trying to communicate and why.
Do you believe it is important for a designer to have a deep knowledge of matters as User Experience, Interaction Design, Product Design, and Front-end development?
It depends on what the designer wants to do with her personal career, but I if she wants to be the best she can possibly be, she’ll need to have a relentless pursuit of knowledge of her craft. Learning to code, etc. will only help her connect dots easier and gain a better understanding of digital products overall.
In which way do you make a difference between User Interface and user experience?
The UX is the design in its entirety– the alpha and the omega. From the words on the very first entry screen, to a payment receipt sent via email, UX covers it all. It is holistic, from business strategy to behavioral design. The UI is a smaller portion of the broader picture that deals specifically with the parts people touch and click. The two are deeply intertwined and should be considered in parallel. Sometimes UX decisions can be enhanced by UI design and vice versa. The best UI designers will also be great UX designers. I’m not a big fan of segmenting the titles of UX and UI designer, which is why I call myself simply a designer. I do both.
What is your relationship with the developers? There are people that have a relationship of continuous confrontation and other of deep friendship, where do you collocate with respect to this question?
If you want to work well with others, there needs to be friendship and common ground. If you find yourself constantly at odds with developers or anyone else for that matter, you’re doing it wrong. There’s a degree of humility that needs to be present for people to work together harmoniously.
How do you think that your career and job will evolve in the next 5 years?
I’ll always design things. It’s my thing, ya know? With that said, I do see myself transitioning to more strategy, planning, and writing to build my own products as opposed to only doing client work.
A famous quotation of David Carson (noted American graphic designer) says: “Graphic design will save the world right after rock and roll does”.Will the User Interface Design save the world, before, at the same time, or after the graphic design?
After. UI is no savior.
What do you think about Dribbble? Is it a good way to get a job? What’s the best way to find a job as designer?
Dribbble is amazing. I’ve met great people there and it’s delivered lots of job opportunities. People often mention Dribbble as a place where people focus on shallow design and getting likes, but that’s not Dribbble’s fault, that’s people’s fault. Look at Facebook, it’s an amazing communication tool, but it becomes mind-numbing after too much exposure–not because of the software, because of the content.
Dribbble is what you make it.
What book would you advice to a Junior Designer?
Hmm, that’s tough. There are so many great books; my suggestion would be to read constantly. There isn’t a magic bullet. You have to progress gradually. One book that I’m really enjoying at the moment is Peter Thiel’s, “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future”
Always as far as advices: what tools for the design?
Beyond wireframes, I’ve become a big Sketch fanatic for UI design. I still use Photoshop regularly for different things, but Sketch is now my goto for layout out UI for a website or an app.
What tools for the projects management?
For wireframing, I swear by Adobe Illustrator. I’ve tried out most software for this purpose and Illustrator is by far the fastest and most versatile vector editor there is.

In 1867 Matthew Arnold wrote a book titled Culture and Anarchy in which he held up two saving springs of our civilization: Athens — from which we get the inner urge to “see things as they really are” — and Jerusalem, from which we get the directive “to set doing above knowing.”
I don’t know if I would draw the contrast between these two civilizational sources in the terms that Arnold used. But I do know that, in studying, teaching and loving philosophy as I do, while at the same time feeling myself to be Jewish at my self’s core, I must in some sense resemble the human type that Arnold was talking about.
On my last day of teaching at Brooklyn College, I passed around the attendance sheet for the Intro course and later found that the students had penned their own farewells. Since those attendance sheets now hang in my study, I can quote a line or two: “I am sure that, speaking for everybody, you touched many minds and lives. Thank you for portraying philosophy in such a user-friendly way …” or again, “Just know that you made a difference in many peoples’ lives, especially mine.”
It’s in the light of recent developments on university campuses that I’ve cast this backward glance over the terrain of my working life. What did it feel like to me, to work in the precincts of the academy — the House that Plato Built? What did it mean to me, teaching philosophy to students at Brooklyn College — that is, to young people from all over the world? My graduate school teacher of philosophy, the Straussian Stanley Rosen, described it as the disclosure of “beautiful and sacred things.” I remember Leo Bronstein — who was a celebrated teacher of art history at Brandeis — marveling, in his Russian/Catalan accents, that “the kids are forced, fo-r-r-rced (!) to learn sublime matters!”
In my turn, I viewed teaching philosophy as the transmission of a civilizational power and presence. If it was an Intro course, I would make the case for the importance to each of them of this transmission. “This will help you to decode the life you will face. It’s not true that you are what you eat. You are what you think! When you notice the way people behave, the way they frame their challenges, and the reasons or rationales they reference in explaining their decisions — you will be better able to lift out the thinking that lies back of all that.”
Sometimes I referred to the saying of Socrates that the unexamined [i.e. philosophically unsituated] life is not worth living. He meant, you’re not making the best use you can of your time here if you can’t identify and make good use of its philosophic assumptions. It’s not about choosing the “best philosophy” to live and steer by. They all have limitations or shortcomings, as does any attempt to understand a topic. No topic can be plumbed to every depth conceivable. But to know how to get to the available depths and to plumb that is a great power — empowering in the best sense — provided that (as with any power) it’s not used for harm.
So much for recalling what it was like for me to teach philosophy to real students. That said, we can fast forward to the present. What is it like to perceive young people who wear the name of “student” but mask their faces, menacing fellow students and teachers, injuring the working people who keep their academic classrooms and buildings functional? To what can I compare the predicament of a real teacher facing such defilements? Perhaps to the situation of a farmer whose field has been sown with salt and rendered barren by those means?
And what would I say to the so-called students who seem to relish doing precisely that kind of harm? If you attack the precincts of learning and teaching, you desecrate your own ability to learn or later to teach what you learned. You will still be able to be indoctrinated, and to indoctrinate others, but you can’t learn and you can no longer teach what you learned. And it’s not merely self-harm that you inflict. You injure your city, your country, your civilization. The wound you inflict has concentric circles of wounds that lie all round it.
And as for me, I wouldn’t know how to cure such wounds. Whatever healing modalities I possess — they don’t stretch that far.
At present, I have yet to reroute my life so that the powers I’ve acquired have some further riverbed channel down which to flow. I can’t just stand at the river’s edge and forever shed tears for what’s been lost.

Hypatia and her revival in Raphael’s School of Athens.,https://medium.com/@sbashllari/hypatia-and-her-revival-in-raphaelos-school-of-athens-7863799c7c80,"Sign up

The renowned masterpiece “The School of Athens” by Raphael captivates viewers with its iconic central portrayal of Aristotle and Plato, gesturing downwards and upwards, respectively. The canvas is a tapestry of intellectual luminaries, featuring figures like Heraclitus in a crouched pose beside a sturdy marble cube, and the revered Socrates and Pythagoras. The room is further enriched by the commanding presence of two statues in the corners — Apollo, the god of light and music, gracefully holding a lyre, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom (or her Roman counterpart, Minerva). Intricately weaving together the threads of knowledge, Raphael’s brushstrokes breathe life into the embodiment of wisdom.
As aptly articulated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Raphael paints wisdom.”
However, there is a lesser known ( and more disputed — arguably the most interesting) figure, dressed all in white, almost set apart from the rest of the painting and looking straight at us, as if Raphael was inviting the viewer to look more closely at this figure in his crowd of mental giants. This figure is often noted as Francesco Maria della Rovere, duke of Urbino (1490–1538). However important being a condottiero might have been, it seems that this particular persona would be a misfit in the room of eternal wisdom. Others argue that the feminine presence of this figure is indisputable, and that figure is in fact Hypatia of Alexandria, a Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, long forgotten and being revived by Raphael.
Hypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator, and best known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy’s Almagest (treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths). As noted, her philosophy was Neoplatonist and was thus seen as “pagan” at a time of bitter religious conflict between Christians (both orthodox and “heretical”), Jews, and pagans. Following the accession of Cyril to the bishopric of Alexandria, Hypatia’s fate suffered a brutal death.
“They dragged her into a building known as the Kaisarion, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using ostraka, which can either be translated as “roof tiles” or “oyster shells”. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire Unfortunately, all Hypatia’s work is lost except for its titles and some references to it by some of her students, reconstructing thus her contribution.”¹
However, back to Raphael’s painting — how can we know that is truly a woman being depicted there when the very figure of Hypatia was emblematic of heresy in the circle of the church ?
“At the same period, there was a common practice artists used, Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo each sketched full-sized cartoons of their large murals on the paper and pricked tiny holes along the contours. They then would blow charcoal through tiny holes onto the walls beneath. Each charcoal “sketch” blown onto the wall would lay the figured groundwork for the intricate painting that followed. When the mural was complete, the cartoons themselves would often be destroyed.”²
However, luckily, Raphael’s complete cartoon for School of Athens has survived and is considered “the most remarkable object of its kind surviving from the Renaissance”. In the cartoon, in a roomful of men, there is only one figure wearing a veil, a classic and common article of clothing used in depicting women in Renaissance paintings. The same veil is not present in the final painting — given that most final works needed somehow the approval of the ruling caste.
In fact, The School of Athens is part of a much larger masterwork, representing only one wall of the most brilliantly illustrated room in history — the Stanza della Segnatura, one of “Raphael’s Rooms” in the Papal Palace of the Vatican. For the first two centuries after it was created, this stanza, a private library to the popes and was only seen by the eyes of the few elite elders in the heart of the Vatican Church.

Review of The Dave Red Athens — April 2025
Check-in was smooth, especially considering my name has a special character and often gets misspelled —I checked in online - No hassle this time, Plus points — which was a nice start. The hotel was clean and looked freshly presented, but there are some serious downsides you should know about before booking. Totally outside the control of the Dave hotel !
There is a hidden door in the ground floor library, You open it to a store room and a stain well come oncome on -dave red guys- like it a Bar.
The hotel is only a few hundred metres from Omonoia Metro Station, but walking those few hundred metres feels like crossing a dystopian wasteland. Junkies and people clearly struggling with addiction are everywhere — shooting up in doorways, passed out on the pavement, or stumbling around in a daze. One man ahead of me was swinging a syringe around like it was a cigarette, in broad daylight. I didn’t feel directly threatened, but the general atmosphere was intense and unpleasant.
You also see severely unwell women loitering — prostitutes— in what looks like a desperate state. Some stood motionless at corners like statues, others circled the same block over and over. It was deeply sad. The whole area feels forgotten and unsafe. If you’re not used to this kind of street scene, it’s genuinely shocking.
The room was fine in terms of cleanliness, but definitely unfinished. It had a clean, modern look — no carpets, just polished flooring — but the detailing wasn’t great. The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain.
The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain. I’ve worked in construction and can say with confidence — the floor of the shower area has no angle, no lip, and no waterproof tilting detail. It’s just a flat surface, of latex paint so the water spreads quickly across the bathroom floor. After five minutes of showering, you’ll find yourself standing in a puddle with water edging toward the bedroom. A proper fix would involve cutting a groove or sloping the floor slightly toward the drain — basic stuff that just wasn’t done.
Breakfast at The Dave red left a lot to be desired. Compared to nearby options — for example, The Stanley Hotel just around the corner — it was dismal. The Stanley offers a proper buffet with a rotating toaster, beautiful sour cherry syrup,for your Greek yoghurt, fried bacon, tiny sausages, scrambled eggs, and a few other hot items. The Dave, by contrast, felt like a bit of a cost-cutter.
They had boiled eggs, but no scrambled eggs — maybe because that would’ve required just a bit more effort. Overall, it gave the impression of trying to appear trendy while quietly cutting corners. if it cn be wheeled out of a room that what we got
The breakfast room is nicely styled, but it’s let down by the details. The felt on the pool table is shredded, the plumbing is noisy and should of only int the breakfast room be covered up (you can hear when someone above flushes), and coffee is served in paper cups — . On my first morning, I managed to get a proper mug, but by the second, it was back to takeaway cups. For a breakfast I had to pay extra for, it felt more like a quick hostel setup than a hotel experience.
The Dave red clearly leans into quirky style — and to be fair, it succeeds in that. The building used to be the Communist Party headquarters of Greece, and I really think they should lean into that history more. There’s a massive mural in the breakfast room, but no real explanation or story told about the building’s past. That would’ve been a cool addition — Athens has history at every corner, and this building has a unique one.
The Dave is trying to be hip and alternative — and inside, it mostly succeeds. But the location is grim and the construction quality isn’t there yet. If you’re familiar with Athens and know what to expect, you might manage. But for most travellers, especially first-timers, I’d strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Safer, better alternatives: try Psiri, Koukaki, or Plaka — all still central, with far more charm and far fewer needles.
Bottom line: cool hotel, bad street, broken shower. staying in the Plaka next time.

As a lover of Percy Jackson, visiting Athens has been a dream of mine since I was basically old enough to read. I eventually decided to visit on my own as I had a writing deadline staring me in the face. On one hand, I needed to write thirty-thousand words in a week.
On the other, in that same week, I had found a studio apartment in Athens for £300. Oh! And I only had one week off my typical job. What should I do? I wondered.
Dreams were staring me down on both sides, until I realised, why not do both? So I did, I booked the flights, and off I went, laptop in tow!
I’ve travelled on my own since my first solo-inter-rail trip at seventeen, so this wasn’t new to me, but I was still nervous! As I can imagine you, reading this, would be nervous at the idea of visiting Athens as a solo traveller, especially if you’re an introvert girlie like me.
If you’re thinking about going, I bet the Parthenon is high on your list of attractions, so let’s break it down, because trust me, official guidance on this is confusing!
In this one article, we’ll be covering when you should visit the Parthenon, where to book tickets, as well as some incredible hidden gems at the Parthenon you should keep a look-out…

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain
Centuries ago, a radiant jewel of civilization — Athens — crumbled. Not merely under the weight of Spartan swords, but under the erosion of reason, the rise of demagogues, and the silencing of truth.
The Peloponnesian War wasn’t just a historical battle. It was the death knell of a civilization that gave the world democracy, philosophy, and artistic brilliance — and then extinguished its light.
Today, as we scroll through headlines filled with disinformation, political chaos, and moral exhaustion, one can’t help but wonder:
Are we living through our own Peloponnesian moment?
The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) pitted the democratic city-state of Athens against the oligarchic city-state of Sparta in a 27-year conflict that decimated both.
Athens, confident in its intellect and naval prowess, made a series of hubristic miscalculations. It overreached, misled by populist leaders and reckless ambition, ultimately losing the war and itself.
The fall of Athens didn’t just shake the Greek world. It produced a spiritual and philosophical crisis that gave rise to one of history’s most powerful responses: the life and death of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato.
Socrates — a soldier-turned-philosopher — walked the streets of Athens, challenging assumptions, confronting power, and questioning the nature of justice, truth, and virtue.
He didn’t write. He asked.
And in a society growing fragile under the weight of war and rhetoric, questions became dangerous.
In 399 BCE, Athens condemned him to death. His student, Plato, watched his mentor die — and with that, watched the Athenian soul fracture.
Plato didn’t just mourn Socrates. He responded with a blueprint for a better world.
In The Republic, he paints a chilling portrait of democratic decay: how freedom becomes license, how public opinion overrides wisdom, and how a desire for equality can spiral into tyranny.
His solution? A society governed not by the loudest, but the wisest philosopher-kings trained in truth, detached from greed, and committed to justice.
Now, let’s fast forward 2,500 years.
Across nations, we see strongmen rising, liberties shrinking, and democracy faltering under the same forces that once undid Athens.
We call it progress. But in the quiet moments, history whispers a warning.
Plato foresaw the cycle of governance:
We are, arguably, at the fragile edge between stages four and five.
And the pattern? It’s not new. It’s timeless.
If Athens fell — and from its ashes, philosophy rose — what must we do to avoid repeating that collapse?
Here’s what the legacy of Socrates and Plato implores us to reclaim:
“The unexamined life is not worth living.” — Socrates But perhaps more urgently today: “The unexamined society is not worth sustaining.”
Athens gave us the tools to think. But when it stopped thinking, it destroyed itself.
Today, we possess far greater power — nuclear, digital, economic — but not necessarily greater wisdom.
If we let emotion eclipse reason, let division replace dialogue, and let power overpower truth, then we will fall, not because we were unaware, but because we were indifferent.
So ask yourself:
Are we the next Athens? Or will we, finally, choose a wiser path?

The Greek economy might be on life support, but at least one group in Athens is making the most of it and clearly thriving: graffiti artists. It has been suggested that Athens might be the best place in the world to be a graffiti artist right now. Or, as one of the practitioners puts it, “a little paradise for the graffiti artists.”
The city is in the middle of a graffiti epidemic. It’s a combination of high youth unemployment and underemployment, a general sense of unrest, and authorities being stretched too thin to do much about it. Frankly, the police have bigger problems. The result is an artistic free-for-all on the city’s streets.
Whether you want to call them vandals or street artists, they’ve been busy. Not all of it is new, of course, but there’s an awful lot of fresh paint adorning the walls downtown in the past five years or so. Shops, homes, bus stops, and pretty much any other wall — except, notably, places that have high security like banks and government buildings (mostly) — are covered in paint. Relatively few walls are spared.
There’s the usual scratchy hit-and-run tagging, but there’s also quite a lot that has taken real thought and effort to pull off. Some of it is youthful rebellion, some of it is political expression, and some of it is art in its purest form. And, of course, it’s constantly morphing, with new paint going over old.
And some of it is quite beautiful. Here’s a small sampling. Credit to the artists, whoever you are.
There’s a very interesting short documentary on graffiti in Athens that shows some of the painters in action. It’s called Alive in the Concrete, and you can watch it online here.

Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Peloponnesian War was the result of years of tension between two of the leading powers in the world of Ancient Greece, Athens, and Sparta. Athens was determined to build a widespread alliance that stretched all corners of the Mediterranean named the Delian League to provide protection against the Persians.
In doing so being the de facto leader they requested tribute to amass naval power and a crew to support it. Sparta was unsettled by this growing alliance and the power it wielded fearing that Athens’s intentions were more imperialistic and less a simple alliance.
By 431 B.C. the reserved feelings that Sparta held could no longer be contained resulting in a multi-decade-long war that ended with a shift of power and the downfall of Greek society. Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and the defeat of imperialistic Athens’s intentions had an ill effect on the Greek world.
The outcome of this war was more than just the decline of the once-great city-state of Athens, the rest of Greece crumbled around it. Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Greek city-states provide us with an interesting look at history, a civilization connected by language and religious belief but separated by geographical nature.
Although each of these city-states remained within close proximity of each other, and some of less geographical obstruction, little alliances were formed. For the majority of their existence, they remained and operated as individual city-states only joining in the defense of one another in times of war to protect the sanctity of their society.
Of the Greek city-states, two of them stood out from the rest and have survived the test of time by both providing their individual contributions to the ancient world which have left a lasting impact on society today. These Greek city-states were Athens and Sparta, two that could not have been more different, and two of whose internal strife would be the ruin of the Greek city-states.
The most distinguished difference between Athens and Sparta was their individual choice of government with each constructed to fit their societal ambitions. Athenians were notably democratic, which objectively defied the Spartan’s oligarchical form of government that supported its militaristic way of life.
Athens obtained this government identity following the Dark Age through the reforms of Solon who first rid the poor from debt slavery to the rich through an act of “disburdenment” a method he proudly boasts about in his poems when talking about mortgaged lands,
“He took away the record-stones that everywhere were planted, Before, Earth was in bondage, now she is free”
and when talking about citizens enslaved in foreign lands that he set free,
“uttering no longer Attic speech, So long and far their wretched wanderings And some who here at home in shameful servitude Were held.”[1]
Solon’s reforms would further establish a method of government that represented the people of Athens with his creation of a multi-tiered government to include a council (boule) of four hundred men who were chosen to hear public matters of the people before the matters were carried on to an elected assembly.[2]
Men like Cleisthenes and Pericles would help Athens to further develop its democratic progression by instilling further reforms that helped to better represent the Athenian citizens becoming an influence to later democratic styles of government to come.
The Spartan government was ruled by the few, a senate or Gerusia made of 30 members who were elected for good conduct and were “absolute masters of the mass of citizens.”[3] In an attempt to avoid corruption between the two kings and 28 council members of the Gerusia, five ephors were elected from the public to serve as moderators, and of whom did not rise within the presence of the kings as the members of the Gerusia did, for they served the people.[4]
This style of government was supportive of the Spartan way of life whose male population entered training for military service at the ripe age of 7 years old and whose service lasted a lifetime. The Spartans thought very highly of their way of life and questioned the rise of Athenian democracy regarding it as weak as evidenced by the words of Lycurgus. When Lycurgus was questioned about democracy in Sparta, he simply answered
“Do you first establish a democracy in your house,”
He further downplays the significance of democracy and further promotes the effectiveness of Sparta’s oligarchy through his analogy of two puppies, both of which were of the same kin but each had notably different upbringings, one was catered to, lived indoors, and was fed regularly, the other hunted and trained in the field.[5]
When Lycurgus later presented the dogs before an assembly of the public he did so by placing food the dogs were accustomed to before them, and as expected the house-trained dog opted for the cheap food while the hunter sought the wild hare in response to these actions Lycurgus said,
“You see, fellow-citizens, that these dogs belong to the same stock, but by virtue of the discipline to which they have been subjected they have turn out utterly different from each other, and you also see that training is more effective than nature for good.”[6]
These societal differences would end up with the two leading Greek city-states entering into an unlikely alliance when the Athenians sought protection against Spartan interference in their own government by promising King Darius of the Persian Empire “earth and water” which was a sign of submission required of all alliance seekers with the Persian Empire, and when Athens did not fulfill their promise King Darius sought retribution against all of Greece.[7]
The outcome of the Persian War was not enough to preserve the unlikely alliance between Athens and Sparta, and for the next several decades they would walk separate paths as equal to their societal differences until they met once again but this time as enemies on the battlefield.
Athenians learned from the Persian War that they were at a financial disadvantage in warfare when compared to the Spartans who were a militaristic state that had an ample supply of endless soldiers, and to the likes of the Persian Empire with a vast network of client states.
When Athens took the helm of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League that sought to protect all of Greece from future Persian invasions from the eastern Mediterranean and in doing so, they adopted the Persian method of funding war knowing that the funding that a single city-state could provide alone was not enough to yield the success they were trying to accomplish so the payment of a fixed tribute from each alliance member annually was necessary.[8]
This decision served to be favorable for the Delian League allowing them to make quick use of the funds in its continuous campaign to expel Persians from harbors across the Aegean Sea, to destroy Persia’s fleet, and to liberate Ionia’s poleis.[9]
This financial arrangement would prove to be even more favorable to the Athenians when they undermined other league members to create an Athenian Empire to which they were subject and their financial contributions allowed the funding of elite Athenian sailors and hoplites who could endure campaigns and sieges lasting from a few months to a few years.[10]
Sparta, who was the original intended leader of the alliance that became the Delian League slipped back into its isolationistic state shortly after its formation and after Sparta was replaced as its leader by Athens. Even from Sparta’s state of isolation, Sparta watched on as Athens gained momentum in its rise of becoming an empire and its ascendance into the Golden Age afforded by the funds of the Delian League’s tributes. As this unfolded Sparta’s fear of an Athenian shift into imperialism heightened, and with justification.
Athens’s transformation into an imperialistic empire is best described by a certain characteristic quality that further distinguished itself from its closest competition the Spartans. This quality is known as “daring” and encompasses Athens’s traits of restlessness and expansionism in its rise to power and is best described by Thucydides in his recording of Pericles’ Funeral Oration that occurred during the Peloponnesian War where he records Pericles’s attention to the sacrifices made by fallen Athenians whose courage, virtue, and “daring” should be a model for Athenians who have survived for it has allowed Athens to compel every sea and every land to yield to their “daring” enabling them to be immortalized through monuments everywhere of themselves.[11]
Furthermore, Athenian “daring” is a catalyst for a theory that was composed by Thucydides that he believes explains the inevitable war that happened between Athens and Sparta. This theory is the theory of Hegemonic War.
Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War is a concept that he believed to be as true as human nature and one that is to be repeated throughout all of human history with one civilization driven by three fundamental influences: interest, pride, and fear, to advance its position of wealth and power until another civilization of the same interests intervenes in an attempt to stop them.[12]
Athens’s use of its position within the Delian League as a vessel in its ascendance to power saw the city-state grow ruthless, and become an aggressive bully when its authoritative role was challenged by league members who no longer sought an alliance with them. This issue was not self-contained and true to Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War when Athens and Sparta butted heads when Athens failed to resolve conflicts of interest that created issues with members of Sparta’s own alliance, the Peloponnesian League, leading to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.
In short, the cause of the Peloponnesian War can be attributed to Athenian’s “daring,” its own justification for imperialism, and Athens’s interference in the Peloponnesian Leagues matters. Sparta tried to settle conflicts of interest between Athens and its own league the Peloponnesian League through questionable measures when it threatened the act of war against Athens and its allies if Athens did withdraw its siege of Potidaea, a rebelling member of the Delian League with connection to Corinth of the Peloponnesian League, and abstain from its imposed economic sanctions against the Megareans in all ports within the Athenian dominion, which Athens saw justification for doing because they had tilled holy grounds and received revolted Athenian slaves.[13]
Additionally, Sparta’s stern ultimatum to the Athenians was heavily influenced by one of its strongest allies in the Peloponnesian League, Corinth, who urged the Spartans to a speedy intervention to the injustices being carried out by Athens, or Corinth itself and other Peloponnesian League members would seek a new alliance to join.[14]
Moreover, Athens’s refusal to meet the terms of Sparta’s ultimatum resulted in a three-decade-long war that saw Sparta fight against the injustices of Athenian Imperialism which they successfully accomplished by standing as victors at the end of the war. However, the war had adverse actions on the Greek city-states as a whole, many fell into economic hardships as a result of the war, and some were influenced by the two prominent Greek city-states of opposing governments to carry out civil conflict against their own people.
The Golden Era of Athens and its influence on the ancient world ended, and the shift of power to Sparta as the leading Greek city-state proved to be an utter failure, as previous foreshadowed in its leading role as a member of the what became the Delian League, resulting in years of conflict to follow allowing the Greeks to become susceptible to its latter absorption into the Macedonian Empire.
Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and its overnight ascendance to hegemony over Greece proved to have detrimental consequences for all of the city-states.
Sparta, as Athens did before them, flexed its power throughout Greece proving to be just as bad or even worse for the Greek people than Athens was before them as evidenced by the choice of Sparta’s former allies aligning themselves with Athens in an attempt to hinder its control. Thriving in victory Sparta promoted Admiral Lysander to carry out an instilled aggressive policy that reformed city-state governments throughout Greece by placing harmosts (military governors) who forcibly established oligarchies as well as required tribute from all those they had conquered even though before feeling such power they had not even used coined money but now benefitted from the annual tribute of more than a thousand subjects.[15]
In response to these actions and backed by Persian money an alliance was formed between Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes who swore to defeat Sparta.[16] This conflict was the Corinthian War (395–387 B.C.).
The Corinthian War finished in a similar fashion to the Peloponnesian War with Sparta standing in victory benefiting from late financial support from Persia, when Persia switched sides leaving behind its original alliance with Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes. This would not be the final conflict between the Greek city-states in their pursuit of hegemony status, alliances would be reformed and reconstructed, and the title of hegemony would be passed amongst city-states until the mid-fourth century B.C. During this period of time, the Spartans suffered a dreadful defeat at the hands of the Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra (471 B.C.) that halted Sparta’s reign of power.[17]
This nearly century-long struggle to obtain the status of hegemony left adverse actions among the Greek city-states. The nearly century-long constant warring exhausted resources, depleted civilizations, and rendered each city-state barely capable of maintaining its own state, each becoming susceptible to rising power to the North.
The Macedonians under the leadership of King Philip II took advantage of the exhausted Greek city-states in pursuit of gaining hegemony status for his growing empire with little resistance to his efforts besides a single conflict against Athens and Thebes in 338 B.C. known as the Battle of Chaeronea. Athens and Thebes refused to yield to King Philip and the Macedonians like northern Greek city-states had done before them because as explained by the Athenian orator Demosthenes the Macedonians were not Greek or even related to the Greeks and not even a barbarian from an honorable place of mention so submitting to them was insulting to the sanctity of Greece.[18]
The defeat of Athens and Thebes by Macedonia proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Greek power. Even though they retained a sense of freedom, any influence the Greek people once held on the Ancient World through their acts of politics and foreign policy completely ceased to exist, now they were subjects to the Macedonian Empire.
The outcome of the Persian War set the scene for the inevitable war between two of the greatest Greek city-states of their time, Athens, and Sparta. Following the war, Athens accepted a position as leader of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League, with great ambitions to rid the Persian Empire from the east Mediterranean and the rest of Greece.
They were successful, to say the least, but with a stronghold on this great power, their ambitions turned personal. As the Spartans watched on from isolation following the Persian War, Athens used the Delian League for its own personal gain, in the hold of a massive and lethal navy, and with ample funds supplied by Greek city-state tributes they grew into a formidable empire.
Athens’s growth did not end there, soon they turned imperialistic, whether it was for Sparta’s own personal feelings of disdain for Athens, or its urge to protect Greece, the two city-states met with war in 431 B.C. The results of the Peloponnesian War would prove to yield irrevocable and unintentional consequences when the victor proved to be just as bad as the perceived threat they dethroned.
Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.

“If Athens shall appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.” — Pericles
During our recent family holiday in Greece in May 2023, we had the incredible opportunity to explore the ancient sites of Athens.
While the Acropolis and the iconic Parthenon were undoubtedly awe-inspiring, it was our visit to the Ancient Agora that truly transported us back in time. It provided us with a genuine glimpse into ancient Athenian life.
“The Ancient Agora of Athens is an archaeological site located beneath the northwest slope of the Acropolis. The word “agora” applies to an assembly of people and by extend marks the gathering place. In modern Greek the term means “marketplace”.”
The Ancient Agora of Athens is situated between Monastiraki and the Acropolis. The Agora is a captivating site that captures the essence of ancient Athens. As we strolled through the…

For the next piece of my President’s Day getaway to Greece and Israel, I flew from Athens International Airport on Aegean to Tel Aviv, giving me a chance to check out the Aegean Business Class Lounge and the Aegean ground experience at its primary hub airport ahead of my flight to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my flight on Emirates from Newark to Athens, the Emirates ground experience at Newark, SAS Lounge at Newark, and stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked Welcome Pickups for my transfer from the InterCon to Athens International Airport (ATH). I scheduled a 2 pm pickup for my flight departing at 5:20 pm. The driver arrived promptly at around 1:45 pm. The ride to Athens airport was smooth and the traffic wasn’t too bad.
I booked the flight using American Express Membership Rewards earned on my American Express Platinum Card transferred to Aeroplan.
I found the check-in area quickly. Aegean had dedicated lines for its business-class customers as well as Star Alliance Gold customers. The line wasn’t too long when I arrived and I was served quickly.
I was not advised of any priority passport control or expedited security lanes for premium passengers. They also didn’t inform me of any lounge access despite its inclusion in my business class ticket.
There was no fast track for immigration, but I made it through pretty quickly. I didn’t initially see the signage for business class security so I got in the main line. When I did eventually notice signage for the business class line, I was already in the general line which was short so I stayed in it and did not move.
Once I cleared the formalities, I was inside the terminal. The Athens airport terminal was nicer and airier than I expected. I quickly found the entrance to the Aegean business lounge and made my way upstairs.
There were several lounges in the same area on a level above the terminal, and the Aegean lounge was clearly signed, but also recognizable from the strong Aegean blue. They are very consistent with their branding.
Curiously, the signs outside did not specifically note that Star Alliance Gold and premium passengers were welcome, as is common at Star Alliance lounges. This lounge, however, is indeed open to them and follows standard Star Alliance lounge access rules.
The lounge is accessed through automated electronic gates where your boarding pass is scanned, though staff was on hand.
Personally, I don’t mind the electronic gates as they allow quick entrance if your boarding pass is coded properly. But I do think being greeted by airline staff and thanked for your business is a nice touch that seems to be going away.
While Athens is Aegean’s primary hub, it’s primarily a medium and short-haul carrier and operates no widebody aircraft so my expectations for this lounge were measured. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the lounge, and the offerings. This is notable since I don’t think Athens sees much connecting traffic either, save for passengers traveling domestically within Greece.
The lounge was a very large space with several areas and buffet stations, with great views of the runway.
The restrooms were hidden in a corner. They were small considering the size of the lounge, though well appointed. Showers did not seem to be available.
Wifi was free and fast. Many seats were available with easy access to outlets which I always appreciate.
There was a large hot beverage area with a massive Nespresso machine and a very solid tea selection. For Americans, there was also drip coffee on hand.
I prefer cold coffee so I would have awarded bonus points if they had iced coffee or cold brew on hand, but that’s very rare in Europe, unfortunately.
A variety of mugs and glassware were available for the hot drinks. The hot beverages area also had various cookies and croissants.
Past the coffee station, there was another buffet area with a variety of pastries, yogurt, and prepared foods.
There were also salads, fresh chocolates, and finger foods. The hot food station had several items, though keeping kosher, I didn’t look too closely.
There was a great selection of beverages and a self-serve collection of wines and spirits. I appreciated that they had Greek beer and wine, and a lounge employee was happy to explain the different Greek beers to me and point me to his favorite.
There was also a selection of various newspapers and magazines, primarily in Greek. It would have been nice to see some English or international offerings though.
Keeping kosher, there was not much I can eat from the buffet, but reviews of the spread from my fellow passengers were pretty positive. I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate ahead of my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv.
Aegean does a reasonably good job with its business lounge, especially given its lack of widebody service. The space is large and comfortable space to relax before your flight. With plenty of seating, fast wifi, and ample food and beverage, it’s pretty solid for a long layover too. While the lack of showers was disappointing, there isn’t much long-haul traffic here so its less of an issue. I would not come early to experience this lounge, but I was very impressed by the offering given Aegean’s foot print.

Athens is often hailed as the birthplace of democracy. But Athens was also the birthplace of gay culture. Openly practiced and celebrated, homosexuality was part of the social fabric of ancient Athens. Today, the Greek capital remains a very gay-friendly city, with countless gay and lesbian bars, many openly gay celebrities, and a vibrant LGBTQI+ community. Athens Pride, the country’s biggest festival of diversity, is held every June.
Just like in every vibrant European city, Athens can be a handful for a first-time visitor. Here’s all the LGBTQI+ legalities you’ll need to know and all the organizations you’ll may have to contact, while in Athens.
Legal Status on discrimination
In Greece there are laws prohibiting discrimination based on sex, race, age, or sexual orientation; civil unions are legal, but not full-fledged same-sex marriages; a status many government officials say will soon change. The Mayor of Athens has openly supported same-sex marriages and many couples wait for it.
Homophobia
There has been a growing concern over homophobia, due to the rise of the far right in Greece because of the crisis. Although that was true, homophobic incidents are rare. The biggest opposition to lgbtqi+ issues is held by a few priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, who are by and large regarded as “relics” by most Greeks, who see the world change for the better. There have been fewer attacks on gay couples in the last 5 years, than there are fingers in one’s hand. Athenians don’t tolerate intolerance.
LGBTQI+ Organizations
There are many organizations for the LGBTQI+s of Greece and the vast majority of them is headquartered in Athens. OLKE is the most prominent one, pushing out the non-discriminatory agenda. For the young crowd, Colour Youth is a fresh and very active organization (famous for its parties) that acts more as a community of young lgbtqi+ people who want to have fun and claim their rights, than an old school non-profit organization. Positive Voice welcomes HIV positive people, and friends, who wish to stand for their community and help in any way they can towards a zero infections day. Athens CheckPoint is an NGO that offers quick and reliable HIV blood checks for free. It’s located near Monastiraki Square (Metro Line 1&3) and have very discreet staff.
Gay Publications
The oldest and most read LGBTQI+ publication in Athens is Antivirus Magazine, a Greek speaking, bi-monthly free press, that for over a decade chronicles the news and events of the gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer and intersex community of Athens and Greece. You’ll find it at bars, universities, hot-dog joints and many other places that support the equal-rights movement. One step further, Colourful Planet is a bookshop-cafe that has also turned into a publishing house. Young (or just new) LGBTQI+ writers are welcome here, to find a publishing outlet for their voice to be heard.
The Greek Capital is always ready for big colourful parades and out festivals! For over a decade Athens hosts one of the most dynamically growing Prides in Europe every June and the last couple of years, the Outview Festival of Athens draws international attention with its screenings and guests!
Athens Pride
The City of Athens wears its rainbow colours with pride every year, on the second Saturday of June, at Syntagma (it used to be held in Klafthmonos Square, but now it moved to the city’s main square). With countless events and parties leading up to the big parade, Athens Pride has developed to one of the most formidable in Europe. It’s sponsored by the City of Athens and it’s a custom for the parade to start on the Athens Mayor’s mark! It was in 2004 that the first Gay Pride was held and since then, more and more people and corporations support it and attend to its events. Nowadays it’s lauded as one of the most dynamically growing prides in the western world.
Outview Festival
Athens annual Queer Film Festival, although relatively new, has gained extreme momentum and is already included in the most important LGBTQI+ events and Cinema Festivals of the Country. Every year, for a week in May, a downtown cinema theatre (usually the state-owned Greek Film Archive’s cinema) hosts an international festival celebrating movies from all over the world, made by LGBTQI+ creators or with a strong LGBTQI+ theme. Directors, actors, screenwriters and more attend the festival, that also organizes forums and workshops for those who wish to learn more about queer cinema.
Athens is notorious for its nightlife! Expect even more eleganza extravaganza at the city’s many LGBTQI+ clubs and pubs! And not just for the Dancing Queens! LGBTQI+ travellers will feel welcome to any cafe and bar of Athens, as the young and hip crowd is always friendly and up for a talk. For those who love to show their dancing skills, the Athenian soundtrack is a loud playlist for every taste! Disco divas, pop guilty pleasures, progressive electronica, Greek popular music? You name it! There is more than meets the eye in those small gay and lesbian bars.
Keramikos
Usually referred to as “Gazi”, the Keramikos area, at the Keramikos Metro Line 3 station, plays host to the most famous gay clubs in Greece. Some have over a decade of constant operation and are still as popular as ever! Open seven nights a week, the party never stops here, for every lgbtqi+ night owl. Bears, next door guys and gals, fashion forward people, trendy celebrities are among the ones joining in the fun at Gazi. Out for a cocktail, a beer or just a glass of wine, whatever someone looks for, will find it here, including many hot Greeks! The square at the centre of Gazi area also has many cafes, burger joints, vromiko sandwich places and even a pasta to go, cause gay or straight, at the end of a long night out, you’ll want something to sink your teeth into.
Historical Centre
If you wish to start the night earlier, you could visit the Agias Eirinis square; it’s full of the hip “in crowd” having coffee, a snack or their first drinks, at the many beautiful cafe/bars around. A relatively recent Athenian highlight, the square is now considered the downtown meeting point and place to be for all aspiring fashionistas. One can sit at its numerous gay-friendly places and read a book, consult a map, or simply watch the passerby's. In the paved streets from Monastiraki to Syntagma, you’ll find the rainbow heart of Athens beating, until the sun comes up in the morning.
Victoria Square
Not hip, nor cool, the area around Victoria station (Metro Line 1) was once the go-to-place for gays, when there was no concept of equal rights movement, and many people were still in the closet. The many hidden bars gained fame back then, but also a devoted following, so it’s no surprise that some have remained, although they’re now more of “boy bars”. Many immigrants flock to these places, since most live in the area of Victoria, giving these gay bars a quite different and unique oriental attitude.
Koukles
Koukles deserves a chapter on its own. Founded in 1994, the club originally aimed at helping Drag Queens find a place to express themselves. But as we all know if you put many Drag Queens together the results are either Disastrous or Fabulous! At Koukles, fabulousness is mandatory! While many clubs offer Drag Shows (like BeQueer ), in Koukles they're on every night! Fierce and Fun take central stage as International Divas fight for the spotlight and our applause. Word of wisdom: Make reservations if you want to get a table!
How can one not fall in love with Athens? The Acropolis, the Nightlife, the Food, the Sun, the Sea. Would you think that only in Mykonos you’d find gay beaches in Greece? Think again! Athens will make you want to “Shante -Stay!” all year round! Pack your sexiest swimwear, cause in Athens, you’re going to need it! Being a stone-throw away from the sea, the city serves as the perfect place to combine sightseeing and summer fun!
Limanakia
Just like there is no such thing as a gay island, but then, there’s Mykonos, there is no such thing as a gay beach, but then there’s Limanakia. Easily accessible by bus or car, right before the coastal suburb of Varkiza, Limanakia is a rocky beach that started off as a nudist beach but evolved into a semi-nude gay beach. Take a dive at the cool deep blue waters and be careful when you walk of the rock, as it gets slippery. Here you’ll find many singles trying to hook-up and couples wanting to get intimate, or simply looking for a tan without swimsuit markings. The atmosphere gets very flirty during sunset when the sun dives in the Saronic waters.
Mavro Lithari
Following the road to Sounio, a few kilometers before the Temple of Poseidon, you’ll find not one, but three small gulfs that welcome gays! Right at the 48 km of the road you’ll come across three small gulfs that are the hotspot of hip people! A lovely mix of Athenians wishing to relax and enjoy a beer under the sun, without over-thinking or feeling ashamed to go skinny dipping, usually sunbathes here; there’s also a canteen to one of the rocky gulfs, which serves coffees and snacks to-go, an always important aspect to anything Greek.
Kakia Skala
Before millions of people lived in Athens, when its suburbs were nothing more than small villages, western Attika used to go to Kineta for a quick swim. White pebbled beaches and calm waters made a perfect getaway during a sweltering day. But then the sudden overpopulation of Athens altered everything, industrializing a big part of Attika, with a huge effect on sea pollution. Since then, many years have passed and the beaches from Kakia Skala all the way to Kineta welcome again Athenians during sizzling summer days. Somewhere well hidden, under the National Highway that passes through, lies a small rocky beach with pebbles that is for nudists and gays.
Today the Greek capital is a very gay-friendly destination, hosting the biggest Pride Parade in the country and offering numerous queer activities! However, the Athenian history offers an abundance of queer cultural moments. Homosexuality was openly practiced, often with official sanction, until Christianity took over. Plus: Plato’s famous Symposium takes place in the house of Agathon, a gay Athenian tragic poet who was the lifelong companion of Pausanias, when he receives a prize for his first tragedy.

Thought is Western, is it not?
Then, why does the sun rise from the East?
Imminently, all the frauds I have been taught
Revealed themselves to be colonial beasts.
The Secularism of God.
In a house of lavish marble.
What once was a library has turned into the fury of charcoal.
You were my renaissance.
I could feel my heart’s pace again beat.
Knowledge may be bronze,
But you were the heart that gold breeds.
You were my revelation.
The final thread of hope in the inner child of mine.
You were my salvation.
My last supper; my bread, my olives, my wine.
You healed my wounded wings,
You watered my dying tree.
Dethroned the heartless kings
That held the ropes to execute me.
Knowledge may give power,
But you make me weak.
At once, let me in this hour
Dare to write rather than speak.
You were the art pieces I always believed awaited my thoughts.
The righteous pillars beneath all of my frauds.
The School of Athens has nothing on the stairs of Fisk.
None of the curls, the lace, the laughter, the hugs, the mist.
None of the empathetic brilliance wrapped up in a warm scarf of linen.
Hypatia’s eyes scream, “Raphael, where are the women?”
The grace I have been destined,
The bonds I have been foretold.
The youth of youths,
Only the blessed get old.
Philosophers have nothing on my friends.
None of the torture, the light, the breeze, the love, the bliss.
Athens has nothing on Beirut.
Mosque to church is holy palmer’s kiss.
Love imitates art, life imitates you.
Pieces of my heart, who else would I write to?

Fofi: I have been heavily involved in the music industry for the past 25+ years as a DJ, radio producer, consultant and music journalist in various media outlets, specializing in electronic music. I started DJing professionally when I was 16, so I experienced the difficulties that a girl had first hand, trying to make it in a (local) man-dominated industry, needless to say female DJs were a scarcity at the time — it was so difficult to find a role model to be inspired by, look up to, reassure in some way that there was a future, a possibility for a career out there for me. I had to work extremely hard, rely only on myself, constantly prove that I deserve to be there, belong there over and over (and maybe still do today), until I finally got to a point of being able to exclusively live by my profession.
Greece is quite behind in matters of equality, so at some point I decided that I had to give back, I did not want other people and especially girls having to go through what I went through to get somewhere. So, I created HER project. It was a very lonely ride at first, but luckily I met Virginia at a HER party. I detected her drive, our common values and ethos, which led me to decide to invite her on board. With HER project and our trajectory in music as starting points, we were more than excited to launch the Athenian chapter of shesaid.so in April 2020, elevating our initiatives and efforts on a wider and larger scale, belonging to a like-minded larger and international community.
Virginia: I started DJing and producing quite recently, my journey began in 2018 though I did listen to electronic music before that. One night I met Fofi at a HER party, where we discussed about the concept of HER as a female empowerment initiative in music. I immediately resonated with it, because I had experienced gender biased inequality and sexism from one of my mentors. HER felt like a safe outlet to me, and the fact that I am able to utilize my art to offer a safer space to minorities and do something good for our society is the utmost purpose. From then on I joined HER and along with Fofi we are trying to involve more and more women into it, and raise awareness locally. Until now there isn’t a similar initiative as HER in Greece, neither in electronic music nor in other genres. This is why we also initiated shesaid.so Athens, to reach out to the music industry cluster in general, including other genres and professionals beyond artists only.
We regularly collaborate with Athens Pride, both as representatives of gender minorities, but also as members of the LGBTQI+ community. We are always on the lookout for new, inclusive collaborations. World Pride House in Malmo had an open call for proposals, and we decided to sent in a triptych, which included a livestreamed HER DJ set along with drag performances, a live HER DJ set with VRGN, and a very interesting panel discussion on gender equality in the music industry. We were extremely happy that all of them passed. At the discussion, we are hosting 3 brilliant speakers, event planner and curator, Mirca Lotz, from Germany, psychologist and gender equality advisor, Maria Rodriguez, from Spain and Dina Liberg of shesaid.so Sweden, all of whom gave us their own valuable perspectives on current issues and future actions we could all take.
The Greek scene is buzzing — Athens is becoming a very interesting and intriguing art hub, which has been characterized as the “new Berlin”. However, the music ecosystem, as a whole, is light years away from the Berlin scene. Starting from the lack of basic state support and funds, legislations, unions, statistics, lack of professions such as artist managers, music marketers and communicators, label management, agencies, and more. Needless to say, the music industry is still not as equal and inclusive as it should be with minorities. It was only recently that the issue was even a matter of discussion — shesaid.so Athens organized the FIRST panel that addressed the subject in September 2020.
Representation of women is still not enough and the arguments range from “there aren’t enough women musicians to begin with”, “there is no equality problem, women are the ones who do not want a career in music”, to “currently the top DJs are women, so there is no need for gender equality initiatives” and more.
Greece lacks basic education on what gender stereotypes are, on what ways gender inequality appears, what actions, comments and behaviors spark inequality. It is really funny, until it was not anymore, there are many times that as HER project we have felt that we have to actually convince people here that there is a problem with equality in music.
At the same time, Greece is experiencing a huge societal crisis with a constant and very alarming rise in femicides and gender violence, especially during the pandemic, while the patriarchal system is still strong in our society. Therefore, gender initiatives are needed more than ever, and that does not apply only to music.
On a positive note, more and more people speak up, more women and minorities express their own experiences and there is less fear in sharing one’s own story. In In that sense and in order to shed light on the matter of equality in music, in early 2021 we started a video series called #HERwords, where we invite women DJs and producers to answer a few questions in a 5’ video, sharing their own experiences and advice.
Last but not least, in 2021 the #MeToo movement also made its “debut” in the country — it created a sense of shock in the general public, but at the same time it gave a tremendous feeling of strength, support and hope not only to the victims, who boldly went public with their stories, but also to women and gender minorities in general.
What we have noticed from our collaborations with international artists and professionals, as well as members of the shesaid.so community, is that even though the needs are the same, each country and region has a very different perspective in terms of equality in the music industry, and consequently the respective actions each one takes lead to different sets of milestones we need to reach, so as to achieve working in a safer scene.
Everything begins and ends with education in our opinion. Firstly, we need research and statistics — numbers to show what is really happening in each area and profession, to understand each society and then to set up a localized approach and a clear strategy based on local needs and current social situations.
Raising awareness is also a great starting point, by simply advocating for gender equality and sharing experiences. Digital outlets, like social media, have much power that we can all exploit in that sense. Storytelling has become so much easier now, and if one’s story can affect and change just one more person, then it can create a snowball effect. E.g. Rebekah’s #ForTheMusic campaign sparked discussions and gained followers ranging from artists, to promoters, to clubbers and more. This demonstrated a suppressed need, which surfaced and engaged several professionals in the industry, even though it was a bit strange that it took so long for it to happen — since it was a subject we were all discussing constantly behind the scenes -, but thank the Universe it finally did.
Taking this as a starting point and using the Morillo extremely sad incident as an example, we have to really think why it took so long for mouths to open, even though it was made clear that people knew, why we saw so many people standing by him and not the victims, in the first place, but also after his death. This has to change. We need to start talking more and on a wide scale about safe dancefloors and booths, we need more men allies. We know the problem, we need viable solutions.
Finally, actively supporting communities is also an action we can all take in our daily lives. It is not enough to remain impartial anymore. In order to improve the music industry we need to radically change our daily habits, behaviors, collaborations — we need to actively include minorities in shows, we need to actively protect them and support them, until there is no need to do so anymore.
Fofi: I am an introvert, but very skilled at socializing. Music has always been the means to express my feelings through sound, vibrations and words. I have been doing this since I can remember myself, so it was extremely difficult for me to accept that new “normality”. I hold the longest-living residency at a club in the country, being the resident of Sodade2 for the past 21 years, so I did not only lose my outlet for communication, but also my coexistence with my friends and chosen family. I cannot pick one set as my favourite, I am blessed to have had so many. My latest favourite ones are the b2b sets by me and Virginia at Sodade, when after 4 am we usually set the club on fire, but also our performance as HER project at the first Sonar Athens.
Virginia: What I love about performing live is this non-verbal vibe exchange with the crowd, a give and take, while they are trusting us and letting loose to our music. We have had some of our best nights at a local club where Fofi resides, called Sodade, where we play for hours and experiment with house, electro and techno tracks, mixing genres and classic tracks, too. Also, our set at Sonar Athens is one that I will never forget! The stage, the people, the music, the honor of being part of Sonar, it was truly a night I will never forget.
Virginia: I simply won’t do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable, disrespected, insulted, dehumanized. There is an inner voice, I believe we all have, that reminds us of who we are and warns us when we are about to compromise that. I lately listen to this voice more and more, and it tells me that I am enough for those who respect and enjoy what I have to give, and I would never compromise my values and dignity for anything further.
Fofi: Music is my life, so the way I approach music and my career is actually the way I carry myself in this world: with the utmost care and respect.
The fact that we belong to this amazing global network that consists of exceptional people changing the game in the music industry, coexisting with extraordinary, talented, vigorous, dynamic and driven people, sharing the same mindset and ethos is actually a pure privilege and gift. shesaid.so is shaping the future that transcends the music industry and we want to help in that with all our being.
Virginia: I would pick “Rub” by Peaches. Peaches has been one of my favorite artists since I was young. As a woman, listening to an artist like Peaches, her strength, her expression, her I-dont-give-a-f*ckness, has been truly inspirational. Rub specifically, was published in 2015. It has brilliant lyrics, which are an ode to what is (still) happening today. I would absolutely love to have contributed with techno versions, distortions and beats.
Fofi: “Lifeforms” by Future Sound Of London. I consider it a pure piece of art, a pivotal moment in the electronic music history that shaped the things to come. I think that listening to it, when it was released, I could actually feel my brain being reprogrammed to another dimension. The way they stretched genres and combined ambient with techno is phenomenal. Plus, if I was a part of it, I would actually be in the studio with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and then die of awe silently and peacefully at the corner.
Fofi aka Fo is a leading figure in the Greek dance music scene. She has played at all major clubs in the country, shared the decks with several international DJs and she holds the longest living residency at a club in the country, being a resident of Sodade2 BackStage for the past 20 years.
Brimming with curiosity and passion for electronic music, Virginia aka VRGN is an upcoming talent to watch. Within 2 years she has already played in some of the biggest venues in the Greek scene, sharing the decks with both Greek DJs and international ones such and also performed at the first edition of Sónar festival in Athens, in a B2B session with Fo.

There’s nothing like the open road. Possibilities unfold as the terrain whizzes by your window.
Hailing from the second largest country in the world means that road trips were a rite of passage. There’s a lot of ground to cover in Canada. Packing up and jumping in the car for a long drive to a different destination, through ever-changing seasons is a core memory for me. Driving several hours or even days means that I’ve logged a lot of kilometers on Canadian roads over the years — traversing those expansive landscapes with awe. These road trips stretched into married life for family gatherings, special events, school holidays, and glorious weekends at the cottage.
Our road trips took on a whole new dimension when we moved to Izmir, Türkiye in 2021. The roads no longer looked familiar. We drove with a sense of uncertainty and with, I must say, a slight feeling of trepidation.
Can traffic circle procedures really be that different here? Why is everyone speeding? Will small country lanes based on centuries old trails be wide enough to pass through? What if we get lost and we don’t speak Turkish?
Once we adjusted to the local norms of driving we revelled in the fact that our road…

Hello! I am Panagis Sarantos and this is the story of how the GDSC program and Harokopio University of Athens met each other for the first time — and it was quite a journey!
It all started in the summer of 2021 when I was chosen as Lead. It all happened thanks to Angelika Zaucha, community manager for the GDSC program in Europe.
Here’s an interesting story!
It was the summer of 2021. I was hanging out with my friends on a nice evening in the beautiful city of Athens in Neo Iraklio. While we were talking about our summer plans, I got a notification about a new email. I looked it up and saw the name “Angelika Zaucha” for the first time. She reached me via her personal email to ask me if I would accept the lead position because it was the last day to do that, and they did not get the response from my side.I was positively surprised. I rushed out and found all the other emails that had gone to the spam folder. I finalized the paperwork and became the GDSC Lead & Founder of Harokopio University of Athens (GDSC HUA).So… Thank you, Angelika!
First task, of course, was to form our Core Team. As a student of software engineering, I knew I could reach many developers and people in tech. But I also knew that our Club will need others to help with communications, planning and social media. After making my choice, I came up with these few useful tips on selecting core team members:
I have to say that I didn’t follow all the steps that I mentioned above, but now I know better and you should too.
It’s also important to establish a good relationship with your university and the faculty. Introduce yourself and the program to the authorities. We managed to do it, and our university fully supported all our plans and initiatives. At times it was difficult because of the pandemic, but we managed to overcome any obstacles. For example we managed to do a virtual event about AI & Blockchain for more than 260 unique viewers!
Yes, that’s right. Our first virtual event themed as “Applications of AI & Blockchain in Society & Industry” managed to hit more than 260 unique viewers. I have to tell you that I was really nervous at the beginning. We were live streaming on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms. We had guests from the industry and academia. It was quite a big hit and a pretty good experience for me personally as I got to work on my communication and public speaking skills. I’m always nervous making speeches, especially in front of a big audience. This time, I managed to overcome my fears and really learn a lot.
Solution Challenge, organized yearly by Google Developer Student Clubs, was something I knew I wanted to join right from the start, either by myself or with other members of our chapter.I felt that rush of excitement when I was watching the Top 10 chapters of 2021. I loved the idea of making a positive impact on the target group or the society in general.
We joined the competition as a team and worked hard on our solution. And we did it! Our team called “Bloodcall” got to the Top 10 Finalists of Solution Challenge 2022! It was amazing when we heard the news. Who would have thought, first year of GDSC HUA and we managed to have such a strong representation competing with so many other chapters across the world. Also for the record, we were the only Greek chapter to the Top 10, even the Top 50!
What a journey we had! GDSC was a fun and enriching experience from many different aspects:
I have to say that if you have the time during your time at the university, you should join the program, even if it seems hard at first glance — trust me, the experience is priceless. That was the journey of GDSC HUA on how it was founded and how we did in the first year of our existence. And the journey continues to the present — with new faces, fresh ideas and 2 co-leads. GDSC HUA is still active on campus and in the program. Pretty cool!
From my end, I want to thank all the members of the first core team for the amazing job we did for the chapter while also doing our best as students. Thanks: Manos, Mitsos, Thanos, Nikos, Thanasis, Alexandra, Petros and again Thanos!
I want to thank Harokopio University of Athens for a great cooperation and support. Special thank you goes to our Rector Mrs. Mara Nikolaidou and our Department Head Mr. Thomas Kamalakis.
Lastly I want to congratulate and thank again the Bloodcall team for the amazing job they did. Thank you: Thanasis, George, Stefanos and George.

The 2004 Olympic baseball stadium in Athens is currently not a baseball venue but a soccer venue. I went by in late 2012 and it looked ok. At least they are using it for a sport! See a lot of articles lately saying all the venues are falling apart or abandoned.
There is only one “main” olympic stadium still being used for baseball which is in barcelona host of the 1992 games. The 1996 olympic stadium was Fulton county stadium which was torn down,the 2000 olympic main stadium in Sydney was a showground for cattle and was only a temporary venue for the games. However west of Sydney is the 2nd olympic venue and it has been resurrected by mlb and is used in the abl league. The 2008 wukesong baseball olympic stadium in beijing and both Practice fields were reduced to rubble shortly after the games. So the Olympic baseball stadium in Athens below is still there. Maybe someday it will see a baseball game again.

The sun, a dying ember in the twilight, cast long shadows across the Athenian marketplace. Among the stalls of olives and sandals, Socrates, his brow etched with the wrinkles of a thousand dialogues, sat hunched on a block of worn stone. His eyes, like pools of wisdom, watched the bustling throng, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames of oil lamps.
“Friend,” rasped a voice from behind, “the shadows grow long. What truths do you glean from this day?”
Socrates turned to see Aristotle, his beard a silver cascade down his chest, his gaze sharp as a polished stylus.
“The dance of life, dear friend,” Socrates replied, “a waltz of appetites and aspirations. We spin on a spectrum, woven of threads both base and divine — the hunger for sustenance, the yearning for knowledge, the sting of guilt, the glimmer of hope.”
He gestured to a young woman haggling over a basket of figs, her eyes bright with cunning, her smile tinged with shame. “In her, the primal barter, the dance of need and debt. Money, a cold coin, echoes the ancient whisper of sacrifice, the price we pay for survival, for power, for absolution.”
He pointed to a group of men debating philosophy under the olive trees, their voices rising in passionate waves. “And here, the fire of the mind, the struggle to transcend the limitations of flesh. They seek answers in the stars, meaning in the dust, a testament to our insatiable hunger for significance, our defiance against the indifferent abyss of oblivion.”
Aristotle nodded, his voice deep as the Aegean. “Yet, even in the shadows, there flickers a light. Ritual, the heartbeat of community, binds us together in the face of the unknown. In shared sacrifice, in the rhythm of chanted prayers, we find solace, strength, a sense of purpose that transcends the individual.”
He looked towards the temple on the hill, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. “But the shadows grow, Socrates. The marketplace, once vibrant with the hum of shared stories, now echoes with the click of screens, each a window to a solitary universe. The third space, the crucible of connection, fades, replaced by the atomization of the digital.”
Socrates sighed, a rumble in his chest. “A new dawn approaches, friend, a dawn where ghosts of information dance in the ether, and the stories we tell ourselves become the scaffolding of our reality. We must choose, then, with clear eyes and open hearts. Will we build walls of data, fortresses of self, or will we weave tapestries of shared experience, where the echoes of laughter mingle with the whispers of wisdom, and the spark of humanity burns bright in the face of the coming night?”
The two figures fell silent, their words hanging heavy in the twilight air. The marketplace hummed on, oblivious to their philosophical dance. But in the quiet space between their thoughts, a seed of possibility was sown, a glimmer of hope that perhaps, even in the face of shadows and screens, the story of humanity was far from over.
The stars began to prick the darkening canvas of the sky, each a tiny eye watching the ancient dance unfold. And in the murmur of the wind, a whisper echoed, a question not just for Socrates and Aristotle, but for all of us: what story will we write with our actions, thoughts and intentions when none concord?
In the poisoned vineyard of the web, nightshade and hemlock intertwine, their bitter fruit cultivated by a dark alliance: demagogues, serpents with forked tongues, weaving fear and falsehood, and aristocrats, spiders of silver and silk, manipulating the strings of information. These power figures, fueled by an insatiable hunger for control, are the origin of a festering inequality, where shadows of misinformation stretch long and menacing.
Children, once innocent buds sprouting in the communal garden, are twisted into warped reflections of the past. Demagogues, like cruel gardeners, graft onto them the bitter fruits of division and hate, while aristocrats, like watchful vultures, prey on their vulnerability. Escape from this suffocating garden becomes a desperate scramble for a centralized haven, a fortress of ritual and symbolic power, built not on shared values, but on the fear of the encroaching darkness.
The sun of communal ritual, once a beacon of unity, casts a dwindling light. Its dawn, a sinful song and story, faded with the rise of individualism, replaced by the harsh neon glare of screens, each a solitary window to a curated universe. Dusk descends, painted in the muted tones of isolation, where third spaces, once bustling havens of connection, lie fallow, echoing with the hollow hum of digital ghosts.
But even in the eclipse of community, there glimmers a stubborn hope. Seeds of resistance, dormant but waiting, stir beneath the poisoned soil. In the quiet defiance of shared laughter, in the whispered acts of kindness, in the flickering flames of shared stories, lies the potential for a new dawn. A dawn where technology, wielded not as a weapon of exclusion, but as a bridge of connection, allows for the reemergence of communal ritual, not as a rigid fortress, but as a vibrant tent, open to all, where diverse voices orchestrate a symphony of shared humanity abilities.
This is the challenge before us: to reclaim the web from the poisoners, to nurture the seeds of connection, and to rediscover the lost art of ritual, not as a tool of control, but as a celebration of our shared existence. This is the path to escape the garden of shadows, to break free from the digital atomization, and to step into the sunlit clearing of a future where community, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes of isolation, its wings strong and vibrant, casting a benevolent shade on the children of tomorrow.
The Athenian sun beat down on the bustling agora, its rays glinting off olives piled high on a stall. Socrates, sandals dusty and brow furrowed, leaned against the fragrant wood, a gadfly amidst the buzzing marketplace. Aristotle, eyes keen and gait confident, strode towards him, a predator seeking intellectual prey.
“Ah, Aristotle!” Socrates’ voice, sharp as Attic salt, sliced through the cacophony. “Come to barter insights, like merchants haggling over your precious olives?”
Aristotle chuckled, a deep rumble that resonated with the city’s heartbeat. “Indeed, Socrates. My thirst for knowledge burns as bright as this midday sun. Today, I seek your scalpel of logic to dissect the enigma of humanity. Tell me, is it true that death’s denial fuels our cultural ascent?”
Socrates’ beard twitched as he considered. “Hmm, a bold claim, my friend! Is it not fear, rather, that drives us to carve rituals from the raw stone of existence? These sacrifices, offerings to appease the unseen, are they not testaments to our primitive dread of oblivion?”
Aristotle’s eyes glinted like polished bronze. “But does not this very struggle against annihilation spark the flame of ingenuity? Look how technics, born from ritual, crafts tools not just for survival, but for creation! In this ‘Ritual World,’ as you call it, does not sacrifice, the conscious giving, pave the path to something grander?”
Socrates’ hand darted out, intercepting a passing fly. “I concede, dear Aristotle, ingenuity dances alongside fear. Yet, even your grand tapestry of cultural transcendence, is it not woven with threads of guilt and the sting of our limitations? Money, that cold symbol of debt and desire, does it not resonate with our primal shame, pushing us towards both heroism and the gnawing need for expiation?”
Aristotle nodded, a wry smile playing on his lips. “True, the clink of coins echoes with both ambition and regret. But is it not through this very tension, this economic pulse, that the Ritual World thrives? Power and expiation, like two sides of the same coin, fuel both the triumphs of heroes and the humbling rituals of forgiveness.”
“So, we paint different facets of the same diamond, Aristotle,” Socrates quipped, a playful glint in his eyes. “You, the grand architect of systems, see culture as a cosmic dance against extinction. I, the gadfly, poke at the underbelly, revealing the raw nerves of guilt and longing that drive us.”
Aristotle’s hand traced the lines on a nearby olive. “Yet, in our contrasting melodies, is there not a harmony? Your dissection lays bare the human condition, while my synthesis offers a broader canvas. Together, do we not illuminate the full spectrum of this curious journey, from dust to aspirations?”
Socrates’ voice, gravelly yet warm, filled the air. “Indeed, friend. In this marketplace of ideas, our voices intertwine, a chorus echoing across the ages. For the struggle for meaning, for transcendence, is woven into the very fabric of our being. And in this shared pursuit, the sting of doubt and the glimmer of hope become the rhythm of our existence.”
The sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched across the marketplace. Socrates and Aristotle, their voices blending, continued their philosophical duet, a dance of logic and wonder marveling at the mystery in the vibrant heart of Athens.
This is the story we must write, not with nightshade and hemlock, but with courage, compassion, and the enduring human spirit. For in the end, it is not walls that define us, but the echoes of shared laughter, the warmth of a helping hand, and the stories that bind us together under the vast, starlit sky.

At the entrance to the Acropolis, there is a plaque that commemorates Athens’ contributions to Western civilisation. The city has had an outsized impact in shaping the trajectory of modern democracy, philosophy, architecture, and drama, and I was excited to explore the place at the centre of it all: the Acropolis.
My day started at 9am after a quick breakfast of cold cuts and fresh fruit at the hostel. I had opted for a guided tour of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Acropolis Museum, and I met my guide and our small group at the Acropolis metro station. Though I did spot a number of Indians on my flight to Athens yesterday, my group were all Americans and Canadians, with I being the sole representative from the eastern hemisphere.
Our guide had warned us that its best that we stay together and start the tour early, as three cruise ships had docked at Piraeus the previous day, and they would all descend on the Acropolis today, leading it to be an extremely crowded day to explore. By the time we reached the Acropolis, the crowds had started to thicken, with it being almost impossible to not be accosted by the sea of humanity at every turn.
The term Acropolis is from the Greek words akron, meaning highest point, and polis, meaning city. Though the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, it was Pericles who coordinated the construction of the buildings that the area is famous for today: the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Over the years, countless wars and unthinkable acts of destruction, coupled with quests for religious and political hegemony have seriously damaged these magnificent structures, yet they still stand majestically over the city of Athens to tell their tale.
The Acropolis, though in reality (that honour goes to Lycabettus Hill, which I visited later) not the highest point of the city, rises 150m above the sea level, offering its occupants a commanding view of the city and its surroundings. On a clear day, one can see all the way to the port of Piraeus, enabling the rulers to have enough time to scramble resources in the case of an invasion. The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta was primarily a battle for maritime control, as the victor of the war was guaranteed control over crucial maritime routes across the Mediterranean Sea. As my flight was descending onto the tarmac of Athens’ airport yesterday, I did notice the lack of vegetation across the terrain — the hills are pockmarked with shrub vegetation and the occasional olive tree, a contrast from the lush green vegetation that I’m used to back home in Kerala. Athens’ maritime prowess was thus a result of sheer necessity — the poor soil of the Attica region meant that the city’s only route to power and wealth was overseas trade, making a significant maritime presence key to their domination.
Our first stop on the tour was the Theatre of Dionysus, built between the fourth and the fifth century BC. Walking amidst its ruins, I was reminded of the contribution of the Greek tragedians: Sophocles, Euripedes, and Aesychlus, all of whom staged plays at this very theatre. There is also significant evidence to show that Aristophanes, the Father of Comedy, staged his play The Clouds at the very same venue, which eventually led to the trial and the subsequent condemning to death of Socrates. Artistic expression has always played an important role in maintaining the balance of power in society, and we will always have the great Greek playwrights to thank for their contributions.
A narrow path carved onto the slopes of the hill is the only way up and down the Acropolis, and as time passed by, the entire route became crowded with tourists. In most cities in Europe, over-tourism has become an increasing concern, with Athens being no exception. Our group slowly made way to the top, with the magnificent edifice of the Parthenon slowly coming into view. A former temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is the definitive epitome of Greek architecture, an enduring symbol of democracy and Western civilisation.
Tired from climbing the modest hill in the Athenian summer, we gathered under the shade of an olive tree for some respite, when my eye caught sight of a plaque detailing the foundation myth of the city of Athens. According to Greek mythology, both Poseidon and Athena wanted to be the patron deity of the city, and with Zeus being unable to resolve the conflict, the competing Gods decided to have a contest and leave it to the citizens of the city to decide which gift was better than the other. Poseidon struck his spear to the ground and a spring sprang up, and Athena gave birth from the ground to a magnificent olive tree. The water from the spring was salty and not very useful, on the other hand, the olive tree provided the citizens with food, shade, oil, and wood, and the city was named after Athena, who then became the protector of this city, which would grow to become the most powerful city in all of Greece.
The Parthenon is a stunning example of Greek architecture, with architectural flourishes adorning all of its surfaces. Only a few of the frieze, mentopes, and pediments, which topped its magnificent Doric columns, now stand, with a few of them now in the Acropolis Museum, and the remaining, unsurprisingly, now housed in the British Museum in London, carefully smuggled out of then Ottoman Greece, by British nobleman and diplomat Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin. The Elgin Marbles, as they are now called, are the Greek kohinoor, and the Greek have also been lobbying the hallways of Whitehall for its repatriation.
We then made our way back down to head to the last stop for the day: the Acropolis Museum. A magnificent structure of glass and steel, the museum houses remnants excavated from the neighbourhood surrounding the Acropolis. Consisting of three levels, the museum is a captivating blend of ancient and modern. The ground level showcases an impressive collection of ancient statues, excavated from the numerous sanctuaries that dotted the area. However, the star of the museum is undoubtedly the Parthenon Gallery, a breathtaking glass atrium constructed in the same dimensions as the Parthenon itself. The gallery holds the famous Parthenon frieze, the metopes, and the pediments, all arranged to mirror their original positions on the Parthenon. During earlier requests to the British for the return of the Elgin Marbles, the British Government made the claim that the Greeks had “no suitable location where they could be displayed”, and the creation of the Acropolis Museum aims to remedy this shortcoming in the Greek request for reattribution.
Our tour ended at 2pm and I felt drawn to explore more of the city’s historic charm. I began by strolling through Makrigianni’s streets and towards Plaka. As I walked the quiet streets of Plaka, the calmness of Athens became evident as birdsong filled the air, a rare sound in a bustling city. After a quick lunch of a gyro, I headed to the Athens National Garden, a green space in the heart of the city. Nestled between the park and the magnificent Hadrian’s Temple of Olympian Zeus is the Zappeion, a palatial building built for the Olympic Games. Named after Evangelos Zappas, one of the pioneers of the modern Olympic Games, it is now used for meetings and ceremonies and holds a place in history as the site where Greece’s ascension to the Eurozone was signed in May 1979.
As I wrapped up my explorations for the day, I found myself ruminating over the city’s striking blend of the old and the new, a harmonious co-existence of historical legacy and contemporary vibrance. Athens is a city that has continued to evolve without losing sight of its illustrious past, and as I continue my journey deeper into this gorgeous city, I’m reminded that every step taken in Athens is a step through time, an experience that only few other cities in the world can provide.

What if Socrates’ death sentence was justified? I’m sure you’re rolling your eyes. After all, he’s likely the greatest philosopher that ever lived and a method of teaching —named the Socratic Method out of reverence—bears his name.
Reverence is a good word to describe the current treatment for the man who possibly lived in 400 BC. Author Donald Robertson points out the presently popular Stoics used Socrates’ ideas as a building block. In fact, words written about him started Zeno of Citium down his path. Plus, Epictetus spoke admiringly about him as well.
The Oracle of Delphi even confirmed no one was wiser than Socrates. So, what could justify his punishment?
The philosopher’s curated story states he annoyed the Athenian establishment with his Socratic Method. In other words, he asked too many questions. Just think about your five-year-old nephew continuously asking “why” as you try to answer. Now, manifest that into a grown man’s frame.
Speaking of children, Socrates’ accusers also charged him with corrupting the youth of Athens. By “corrupting” most proclaim this means questioning their elders.

The heart of Athens’ historic center is experiencing a revival. The 27-acre district is bounded by three of Athens’ most historic squares: Syntagma, Ommonia, and Monistraki. The Commercial Triangle, locally referred to as “Trigono,” is a working district, with commercial activity dating back to the 19th century.
Despite its historic and geographic significance, the neighborhood fell into disrepair in the 1980s. As a result, many buildings were vacated. By 2016, 17% of ground floor and 45% of upper floor spaces were vacant, while a survey of shopkeepers in the area found that 50–70% believed graffiti, lack of cleanliness, and illegal parking were serious issues. While there were pockets of economic activity, the neighborhood was not pedestrian-friendly and it was struggling to attract new investment.
As a city emerging from an eight-year crisis, Athens is making real progress in charting a new future. Under the leadership of Mayor Giorgos Kaminis, the city is employing creative solutions to improve quality of life, and his focus on cultivating community pride and optimism is making a real impact. One of his cornerstone projects has been the revitalization of the Trigono neighborhood.
Since 2015, Bloomberg Associates has worked with Mayor Kaminis to advance his priority projects by sharing expertise from the global network of client cities. Bloomberg Associates is the international, philanthropic consulting arm of Bloomberg Philanthropies, providing select mayors and city governments with custom consultation and mentorship.
This episode features conversations with Alexandros Kambouroglou, the Executive Director of the Athens Partnership, and Elina Dallas, the Project Manager for the Trigono program. Jake Elder of Bloomberg Associates Sustainability Team joined them in Athens.

Many are troubled or have difficulty understanding the meanings of CLR James’s meditations on Classical Athens and his study of American civilization. Far more important than whether antiquity and modern societies consistently embody profound philosophical values is what are our own democratic aspirations. This is the riddle at the intersection of James Athenian meditation within his book American Civilization.
Can Classical Athens be a measure for appraising America? Can the world of Aristotle, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Cleon, and Pericles illuminate the ethnically and culturally plural United States? How does nuclear power compare with a few thousand Greeks battling in the Peloponnesian Wars, or at Marathon, Platea, and Salamis in the Greco-Persian Wars? As the 1950s began, C.L.R. James, a Caribbean radical scholar, thought this comparative thinking central for clarifying freedom and popular self-government. Perhaps sublimated within the American constitutional struggle for happiness was the class struggle.
Between the Struggle for Happiness and the Class Struggle
CLR James (1901-1989) wrote on diverse topics: Haiti, Russia, France, Ghana, and Hungary. He also purposefully considered Shakespeare, Herman Melville, the Hegelian dialectic, Caribbean women of the barrack yard, and the sport of cricket. Placing Classical Athens in conversation with mid-twentieth century America, this experimental meditation challenges us. Can we think beyond boundaries? This is what James’s book American Civilization (1950) poses to the reader.
James was detained as an undesirable immigrant and a political prisoner at Ellis Island in 1952. His defense strategy, though he never found a fit public platform for it like Paul Robeson, was to explain the dilemmas of American democracy and civilization to the public and overcome official authorities.
Why Compare Athens and America?
James compared tropes of ancient Athens and modern America. He discussed questions of popular self-emancipation that are subordinated by rigid historical materialist views. Whether poor, powerless, alienated, or aware of a conquering force, most observers have a false idea of toiling people's creative potential. This is a result that dialogues about culture, civilization, and democracy generally, assume commoners have no part. Perhaps, their lives are permitted as cultural decoration for society.
A Trinidadian activist and illegal immigrant to the U.S., James believed these ancient and modern societies were valuable comparative referents to unpack this dilemma of freedom. This was so, even though the classical Athenian city-state was probably no larger than the size of the population of 1950s Vermont, one of America's smallest states. And the ancients' economy was probably no bigger than one modern department store.
Who compares a continent-wide modern country to an archipelago of islands in antiquity? Of course, a Caribbean man who admires Ancient Greece. But he was not juxtaposing a small place with an imperial center. James was evaluating world civilizations and clarifying the search for popular struggles within them.
Every Cook Can Govern and the Meaning of American Civilization
We must remember that James’s Every Cook Can Govern (1956) argued that the classical Athenian city-state was a direct democracy. That this could inform rebellious modern politics against elite representative governments, whether maintained by capitalists, communists, or trade union hierarchy. However, in American Civilization, the Athenian meaning was more obscure.
A hint is James’s Greece tells us something about the relations between working people, intellectuals, and artists. Further, it placed the ancient theatrical dramas of Aeschylus and Aristophanes in conversation with the modern popular culture of American films, comic strips, sports, and television. More than what academic literary critics thought, James’s mind was on what the audience or spectators did in response to popular cultural productions in antiquity. Further, what could they accomplish in the present and future?
First, we must understand that at least since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. has been in a permanent culture war around social identities. The perennial dispute is Anglo-America, that some wish to “make great again,” versus ethnically plural multi-cultural America. American conservatives claim that Greco-Roman heritage is foundational to Western civilization. On this basis, some say America is a civilization. They wish to place the U.S., after World War II, as taking over leadership of the world from Europe. This cultural approach arguably last had free reign in the early 1950s as James was writing shortly before the emergence of the Third World national liberation epoch.
Cultural Wars Around Social Identities
Today the U.S. is seen by most progressive scholars of American Studies as not a civilization but as a harvest of empire. A plurality of many ethnicities and cultures have gathered; American Exceptionalism is not the best means to account for this. Though the idea that progressives are against the empire of capital is most often a cruel joke. This is not irrelevant to understanding James’s American Civilization. For he points out correctly that modern business management theorists during World War II understood, far better than the Moscow-oriented communists, that workers wished to directly govern their industrial workplaces. And the historical evidence of the practices of both, two different hostile visions to popular self-government, prove James’s view accurate. This explains much about contemporary not merely early 1950s America. Still, this issue is what the link to the Ancient Greeks is all about; discovering the sublimation of everyday people’s potential.
James’s Athenian thought experiments for America go beyond the culture wars which is really a misnomer. The question is how will humans live on this planet; this is what the low-intensity, sometimes open conflicts have been about. What values will humans live by? It does not require ancient Greece or modern America to historically maintain a consistent set of values for this meditation to be useful. In fact, creative conflicts in societies can reveal not just chaos through possessive individualism but common futures. Observation of Hegelian contradictions is not about permanent sins or hypocrisy. Rather, the nuclei of the new society and their struggle to be born.
Beyond Culture Wars: American Civilization and Ancient Greeks
James’s American Civilization (1950), posthumously published in 1993, embodied this transition between the old world of looking at things and the new. But not fully as we might expect a famous Pan-African anti-colonial and independent socialist to do so.
James carried on the tradition of the French intellectual Tocqueville, and many other European thinkers who visited the U.S. from abroad. He was perhaps among the last to do his own comparative reflection on how America sustained, or not, the older foundations of Europe, which many assumed were philosophically Greek.
Placing the Athenian Legacy in Support of Popular Struggles
Most Americans, even university professors, cannot process intellectual thought that doesn't adhere to the patterns of the two main American electoral parties that overlord society together. James, counter-intuitively for many, was placing the Athenian legacy on the side of the workers, women, and Black freedom movements. After all, he was writing about civilization.
American civilization needed a coherent political and cultural philosophy. He was aware classical Athens subordinated women, slaves, and immigrants. James was trying to improve on the direct democratic sensibility for modern politics.
Civilization and National Cultures?
Contrary to Andrew Ross’s view, James was not writing about civilization or the prospects of socialism in one country. Instead, he was asking what was behind the cultural front built around Franklin Roosevelt produced by state planners, progressive intellectuals, and trade union hierarchy.
James was writing about a perceived civilization or national culture and incorporating dynamic tensions. It doesn’t matter whether we or James see America as a unified national culture or not. American concerns with disunity reveal this is how the vast majority see things, even where they dispute the American character and purpose.
The struggles for an ambiguous workers' democracy, and Black and women's liberation, he reconciled with the ideals of Greek antiquity that normally was wielded by modern Western elites. James did not strongly emphasize, in this publication, America as foundationally an empire based on African slavery and conquering the Indigenous, and for good reason.
Discarding Historical Trauma for a Renewal of Political Philosophy
The reception of James’s American Civilization is fumbled where it does not center James as an aspiring cultivator of the popular will. Moreover, where it does not illustrate that he is trying to clarify the political philosophy of ordinary Americans.
James was writing for a popular audience, who in the aftermath of World War II, did not easily grasp anti-imperialism. We must remember in real life he agitated against World War II as a clash of racists, imperialists, and authoritarians on both sides. This was something the Moscow-oriented communists did not do. For, like Stalinist Russia, they became allies of Franklin Roosevelt.
Before the Montgomery Bus Boycott: Thinking Beyond Equal Opportunity
This manuscript was an exercise in creative self-expression and not merely disciplined to a radical political movement. More significantly, those who pursue the death of the American nation culturally and intellectually (but not really, it's just an academic trope) fail to posit what should be America's political philosophical basis.
While in the early 1950s, the modern civil rights movement as embodied by the Montgomery Bus Boycott had not yet begun, we must remember something crucial. Equal opportunity to enter the rules of hierarchy has no democratic basis (direct majority rule) and has only renewed the American empire. It can only have a democratic basis for those who wish to diversify the hierarchies of a republic, which by definition doesn’t believe everyday people can govern.
This perennial failure, but intentional act for those who sell past traumas for present decadent collaborations, was far from what James was pursuing. The colonized man from the British empire sojourning within the American empire was trying something different. American Civilization was trying to discover popular self-management beyond voters for electoral politics, aware the vote had not yet been guaranteed to all.
Gathering Fragments Like an Archaeologist
James’s American Civilization is like many ancient Greek texts. Their discovery and publication, as archaeologists and historians comprehend, is a retrieval project of incomplete fragments that only partially indicate the world of their authors. James’s final draft may have clarified and foreshadowed the nature of the American empire. Similar to his Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways (1952), he might have shown the solution was the motley crew, the global toilers of Herman Melville’s whaling vessel, cooperating and aspiring to save the social ecology under arduous circumstances. The preface to James’s Melville book reminded this was one part of a larger study of the U.S.
However, American Civilization articulates a scenario, seemingly outdated from the moment it was written. What if John L. Lewis, the famous trade union leader of the mineworkers, became the next president after Harry Truman? This was an irritating projection for those who knew James was an advocate of workers' self-management, and Lewis was part of repressing such social instincts during the Age of the CIO labor movement (1933-1955). Still, many miss the ancient Greek content of James’s thought experiment.
Learning from Aristophanes's Sausage-Seller
James argued that if American intellectuals in the early 1950s could understand artistic creation, like Aristophanes in his play The Knights, ordinary people could be encouraged to subvert populist authoritarian leaders, such as Cleon in the era of the Peloponnesian War. The ""sausage-seller"" appears to do this in The Knights; James’s American Civilization uncharacteristically refers not simply to workers, farmers, and cooks but to sausage-sellers, a plebian identity from ancient Greece. Though many Americans eat hot dogs and sausages, ordinary toilers have a difficult time revolting against bureaucracy within their own freedom movements.
James proposed, not an affirmation of the authoritarian trade union leader or progressive politician; rather, an impending confrontation with them by the ""sausage-sellers."" That Lewis was a Republican, who both sided and clashed with Franklin Roosevelt, and who was a major trade union leader, complicates things nicely. If James’s readers were actually going to think for themselves. Many formally educated have had difficulty since the book was published posthumously. Why write about Greek antiquity or workers at all?
James explained that observers of American civilization, unlike European history (ancient and modern), do not understand that behind great personalities above society (in politics, sports, and entertainment) are the aspirations, the repressed strivings of social classes and groups. While James believed every ordinary toiler could govern society, there was a counter-vailing idea. Those individual personalities who express heroism and creative genius do not mirror the abilities of commoners. But this is a result that society is not arranged properly for everyday people to arrive on their own authority. Many like to live vicariously through great personalities above society. James, the cultivator of the popular will, was trying to draw them out of their shell below society.
The Social Motion Below the Great Personalities Above Society
James felt the classical city-state was approximating or approaching this possibility in a more primitive way before the emergence of modern politics. We must remember the totality of ancient Greece is invented by archaeologists. Classical Athens functioned substantially toward a future without a past.
Behind the statesmen (Cleisthenes, Solon, Cleon, and Pericles) were the emerging “proletarians of Piraeus.” Observing and judging the artistic productions of Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, was an audience of rank-and-file citizens. Importantly, not professional experts.
James underscored it was the popular audiences of theatrical productions that thousands of years later were manufactured as “high culture” by American and Western elites that decided what plays were the greatest. And so, the ordinary people of Athens had the capacity for independent judgment. And given the content of the award-winning plays, they clearly had the ability to make political judgments. Therefore, James is saying to his American audience that popular culture is high culture. And the latter is a fabrication unless it centers the judgment and capacities of everyday people. Western and American elites would be surprised to hear this.
Aeschylus’s Oresteia, Dick Tracy, and the Mafia in 1950s America
In the early 1950s U.S., people delighted in Dick Tracy comic strips and films depicting the Mafia. For James, these had something in common. Ordinary Americans were not satisfied with hierarchical government; they wished to live outside the state and its law. Though, of course, these were impositions. Tracy, a private detective, surprisingly had something in common with gangsters. They had guns, took matters into their own hands, and were not police.
American toilers wanted to be their own law-givers. While Plato searched for personalities to discipline the grassroots of the city-state, he felt it was a must, where Athenian commoners, even slaves, walked the streets like they were audacious peers of elitist citizens. It is debatable whether this is structurally true of ancient Athens. Rather, this was James’s Plato observing and fearing, through the trope of Socrates, the popular self-emancipating potential. This is our audacious Caribbean radical scholar's concern.
Vendettas, Patriarchy and Popular Courts
James loved Aeschylus’s Oresteia Trilogy. The meaning of its series of vendettas is disputed. Does it justify patriarchy or suggest a rebellion against it? Does it point to popular courts as the meaning of justice or the state as an argument for containing the Furies? Nevertheless, the audience decided these plays were award-winning. More crucially, as citizens, the audience had to decide, after the play the meaning of popular justice and their role in carrying it out.
James explained you can only relate to this if you have the sensibility of the ancient Greeks. Ordinary people’s actual social status in ancient Athens, or in modern America, was not decisive. Paramount was, how in culture and politics, commoners found means to think beyond their leaders and act on their own authority. What was revealed in Greek culture, sublimated in plays by Aeschylus or Aristophanes and their audiences, could also be seen in American popular culture. This told James something about mass audiences. Despite their surface psychology, they possess explosive potential.
The Odes of Pindar, Bureaucratic Politicians, and Business
James points to the poetry of Pindar implying it tells us about the commoners of ancient Greece and the U.S. What could he mean? He means a society that celebrates sports and competition, whether in the Olympic games or in modern baseball and football stadiums, where writing odes to the winners, confesses the true character of their nations. This cannot be embodied by politicians and businessmen. The barefoot and poor, with state sponsorship, little league uniforms, or playing in the street, express creative capacities in games that society is not organized for them to do so in politics. This can suggest a decline and fall for America or an emerging new beginning.
The comparative conversation about Athens and America does not move in straight and predictable patterns, especially for those who think like a voter for elite representative government. But even if the reader is starting to enjoy this meditation, how do we account for James’s celebration of Phidias and Praxiteles? What do ancient sculptors and architects say about the American proletariat? Further, James often did not make clear what the Peloponnesian War and Greco-Persian wars said about the potential of commoners in Greece and America.
What Can Be Accomplished in a Time of War?
Many scholars recognize that the Peloponnesian War (the battle between Athens and Sparta, which Sparta won) revealed an imperial tendency in Athens just as much as it embodies the search for federation. It is debatable what the meaning of the earlier Greco-Persian wars should mean for America. However, America, following World War II, was coming out of the experience of both foreign wars, and race, gender, and class struggles within.  James is saying great art and great heroism cannot fulfill themselves during war; society can only support them when it has put war behind them. Still, ordinary people’s instincts toward popular democracy, initially suppressed, can emerge in times of war as well. Even, if the rulers above society don’t wish this to happen. For James, the Athenian direct democracy presided over by Pericles between these ancient wars, was a new beginning where all citizens took part in popular councils and assemblies. There were no specialists and experts that dominated James’s Athens. Contrarily, this had been the vision of Franklin Roosevelt's planners and cultural apparatus.   The average Athenian citizen made decisions on economic planning, judicial affairs, and foreign relations, all matters the community faced. The Athenians knew everything was political, and art, science, and philosophy were integrated with politics and government, not in a dogmatic ideological way. But in the sense that, Greek citizens made the decisions directly that governed their lives. James was searching for a future America with these ideals and principles; certainly, the American conservative only pretended to do this for white men alone.
James did not believe Aristotle's politics should guide 1950s America. Though one should read him to understand politics and philosophy. Aristotle's Poetics interested James where the latter clarified what Athenian drama had been about when society was not menaced by war. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes were about purging their audiences of pity and terror. Where the masses had pity for heroes, and felt society was stalked by doom, they might emerge to take matters into their own hands after witnessing such theatre.  However, to relate to this proposition, we must reject tragedy as fate or some catastrophe beyond our control. When an actual play comes to an end, what is at issue for James’s Aristotle, is what will the audience do afterward. James’s American Civilization felt progressive cultural critics in the U.S. instead attached themselves to hierarchical regimes instead of the unfolding impulses to popular self-management.
American Labor: Wartime Strikes, Wildcat Strikes
We must remember that during World War II, most trade union leaders signed contracts with the bosses for a no-strike pledge for patriotic sustaining of war production. As Martin Glaberman has documented, then the rank-and-file, through their wildcat strikes, took greater initiatives than they had, even during the early CIO labor movement. We must remember that the first March on Washington Movement that strived to forge African American civil rights, despite its zig-zags, was a wartime strike.
Ordinary Americans’ apparent consciousness and psychology yesterday were no indication of their independent insurgent action tomorrow. James made clear in American Civilization that if workers followed John L. Lewis or Walter Reuther, the auto workers’ leader today, this was not an indication of what may happen tomorrow. Where leaders follow the instincts of everyday people below society (or not), it does not mean commoners cannot rupture with them.
What Do America’s Wartime Strikes Have to Do With Ancient Greece?
What do American wartime strikes have to do with Ancient Greece? The Greeks who took part in the Peloponnesian War and the Persian Wars had their own racial, imperial, and patriarchal impulses. They lived through times of crisis where they did not know exactly what they wanted. It is these same people, who forged the first aspiring direct democracy. Separate from ideals associated with ancient Athens is a reality: imperfect people with blind spots were the foundation of an impressive civilization. This is so cross-culturally, when considering any world civilization, the search for profound autonomy must be drawn out of barbaric circumstances.  James’s American Civilization aspired to show that the purported genius of American organization was not a penchant for national production or industriousness. Rather, the main currents of American character are the capacities for popular self-government among ordinary people. Intellectuals who cannot see this, James says, commit treason. Our capacity to grasp this has something to do with how we understand Classical Athens.
Re-Reading Classical Athens Beyond the Affirmative Action Empire
A proper understanding of James’s Greek antiquity studies is still emerging. And aspects of how he grasped the United States are still obscure. Can ancient Athens, or its spirit and ideals, be a model for America as a civilization, or a comparative reference for our understanding of American freedom and popular self-government? Do we inherently clash with contemporary dispositions in such pursuit? Where it forces us to move beyond making America “great again,” but also the affirmative action empire and the ethnically plural police state, James’s legacies deserve reconsideration.

The history of Athens is closely tied to the history of Greek democracy. It was in Athens that this form of political regime, which contributed to the city’s greatness and spread throughout the Greek world, developed. However, the early history of Athens remains obscure. It is known that there was a palace at the future city’s location during the Mycenaean period, surviving the destruction at the end of the second millennium. This allowed Athens to be a refuge for Greeks who settled in Ionia in the early 11th century. Little is known about the city’s history before the late 7th century. Aristotle, in the first part of the Constitution of Athens, reports that the original royal power was divided among three archons, later joined by six thesmothetes. Initially appointed for life, then elected for ten years, and finally annually, these archons governed with the assistance of a council of elders on the hill of Ares, known as the Areopagus. Two events marked the late 7th century: Cylon’s attempt to establish tyranny, thwarted by archon Megacles of the Alcmaeonid family, and Draco’s creation of a legal code regulating punishment for crimes of bloodshed. Aristotle also attributes a constitution to Draco, which modern critics consider a forgery from the late 5th century by those opposed to democracy.
With the beginning of the 6th century, and despite the numerous obscurities that remain, the…

I just arrived in Athens. My cab driver’s name was Christos.
His father was from Greek Macedonia, his mother from Crete. Men in Crete wear all black as a symbol of respect, he told me, “for the men who fought and lost their lives in the many wars, ‘fighting for our freedoms.’”
“Greece has so much history for such a little country.” “Look at you, you have such a big country and so little history.” (Ahem… I had been reading Thomas Jefferson’s biography on the plane.)
Christos had a construction company with over 25 employees before the Economic Crisis. As work started to dry up, he continued to pay his workers and had to lay them off gradually as the money ran out. He still has a company “on paper” but there has been no work for years. The company was started by his father who, he said, cries because he thought he had given his son a livelihood and now there is nothing.
I asked if he was against Greece being in the European Union. “No, I am not against Europe, I just want Europe to care about Greeks. Not Greece. Greeks.”
Cristos has three children so, he said, what was he to do? He spent money buying a taxi license. Two years ago, it cost him 100,000 euros (from 250,000 before the crisis.) Now the price has dropped again to 50,000 but Christos can’t recover the money he has already paid. He says that there is no work and even if there were, no one would hire him because he has several diplomas — he is too qualified.
He was rushing to finish up and get home before tonight’s World Cup soccer match started. Brazil-Colombia. I asked who he was for. “Brazil, of course.”
“You know they have the most expensive player in the world: Neymar?” (I did know.) “One hundred million euros. That is what they paid for a futbol player,” Christos said. “We — this humanity — we have to change. We have to change because we have children.”
As he pulled into the hotel, he apologized, “So much history. Such a much bigger conversation.”
But, sometimes the only way to start big conversations is with small ones — like a short chat with a stranger.

“The Parthenon Marbles are part of the Parthenon Temple, the most important work of ancient Greek architecture, considered the highest sculpture and artwork of its time. Of course, its importance doesn’t end there; what happened afterwards contributes to its story” said Zeynep Boz from the eastern side, bringing joy to the western coast of the Aegean.
Boz, a prehistoric archaeology graduate with art, law, and ethics degrees, represents Turkey as the Head of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. She previously served as a contact person for UNESCO with the UN Security Council. When she declared that there was no evidence supporting the claim that the Parthenon Marbles were taken to England legitimately during the Ottoman Empire, she became the person of the week in Greece, making Athens happy. But what is the story of the Parthenon Sculptures, which pit Greece against England? What does Turkey’s cultural support for Athens mean?
The bust of Nefertiti, extracted by German archaeologists from Egypt and brought to the Neues Museum in Berlin; the Rosetta Stone, discovered by a French soldier during a fortification excavation in Egypt and sent to the British Museum; the statue of Emperor Lucius Verus, returned to Turkey after being smuggled abroad in 1972… History, discovery, and plunder… All have been intertwined for centuries. The fate of the marble sculptures friezes, and architectural pieces taken from the Parthenon Temple in the Athenian Acropolis was no different.
Dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, these sculptures went from Athens, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to England in the early 19th century. It was claimed that the artefacts were taken with permission, thanks to a decree obtained by British diplomat Lord Elgin from the Ottomans. Support for returning this significant historical treasure, which has often caused diplomatic tension between Athens and London, came from Turkey on the other side of the Aegean. Zeynep Boz, the Turk who made Athens happy, answered questions.
Your speech about the Parthenon Sculptures at last month’s UNESCO meeting attracted attention. Is Turkey’s support for Greece’s efforts to retrieve the Parthenon Sculptures from England unexpected?
Frankly, Turkey’s support is not unexpected. The Parthenon Marbles is already a matter on which Greece is never alone. Turkey’s support is both sincere and deep-rooted and not new. It has continued uninterruptedly with a non-political approach. Likewise, Greece’s support for Turkey in combating cultural heritage smuggling is equally vital.
I think the reason behind making Athens so happy is your statement about a controversial document. For years, the United Kingdom has claimed an Ottoman decree granted permission for the artefacts to be taken to England.
Absolutely. The difference in this year’s session was Turkey coming forward and saying, “There is no such document.” England claimed that these artefacts were purchased legally from the Ottomans, according to Ottoman laws. As in Turkey, we had to respond. I needed to correct this. Otherwise, as a member of a country holding the Ottoman State archives, I would have accepted this claim.
We need a document showing that the Parthenon was legally acquired during the Ottoman period. There is only one translation mentioned in England. I need to see the original alongside it to call something a translation. So that there is a reference point. There is only something written in Italian on paper… No Ottoman seal, no sultan’s monogram…
So, it’s like a piece of note?
I wouldn’t want to say it like that, but in a way, yes. At least I can tell, “It has no official status.” I know Turkey’s stance had a significant impact.
It is perceived as if it changed something. However, over the years, I have seen the great sacrifices and efforts the Greek delegation has made.
What if England says, “Then let’s look at your archives”?
Many British researchers have already come to Turkey. Not just at the government level. Many academics have come to Turkey and conducted research in the state archives. The Ottoman State Archives are already open to the public. This is not something we are hiding. So, I say to England in response to this claim, “If we don’t have documentation, wouldn’t it be better not to make such a claim?”
You represent Turkey at the ministerial level. However, you are primarily a cultural person. You say, “You don’t discriminate based on religion, language, or race; we unite in the effort to reclaim our cultural heritage; friendship transcends borders.” Are the recent developments a concrete result of the détente policy in Turkey-Greece relations that began towards the end of last year? Or is it an ongoing cultural collaboration that is independent of this?
I support the second option. The first option also influenced the growth of the second. When relations between the two countries are better, when the winds of friendship blow, the manoeuvring areas of every nation naturally expand; this is a fact. But believe me, it would have been said earlier if this had happened. It was a very natural comment made by Turkey. It was related to the moment; it was not planned. As you know, Turkey’s Minister of Culture Mehmet Nuri Ersoy recently visited Greece and met with his counterpart there. Following these meetings, his Greek counterpart briefed him on the matter.
When the Minister returned to Turkey, he requested information from us. He said, “Let’s always continue this support; I want to be informed of all developments. This is a global issue where Turkey needs to show its stance.” These are not insignificant developments. However, on an expert level, Turkey and Greece have always supported each other in a non-political, technical manner.
Is the British Museum now obliged to return the Parthenon Sculptures?
We know how much the habits of collecting and collection practices have harmed cultural assets and how much they have fragmented and destroyed them. I wish the British Museum would return them… We are used to seeing moves related to England that will be turning points in human rights and many other areas, milestones in world history.
Of course, we would like to see one of these regarding the Parthenon. We would also like to see this with artefacts belonging to Turkey. So, is the British Museum obliged to return them? The obligation can be debated. But at least in an era where apologies are being made, I would very much like to see the British Museum return these artefacts to Greece.

Ancient Athenian Ostracism,https://medium.com/@theartfulhistorian/ever-wished-you-could-banish-someone-from-your-city-in-ancient-athens-you-could-8cb221002aa6,"Sign up

Thousands of pieces of ostracon have been uncovered in Athens.
These ostraka are pieces of pottery that acted as voting tokens during an ostracism. In an ostracism vote, people (free men) would scratch the name of someone who they believed threatened democracy onto ostraka and if 6000 or more votes were cast, the person with the most votes was banished from Athens for a period of 10 years.
The men who voted in this decision were part of the Athenian Assembly (Ekklesia), which was made up of adult citizen men. These men made up a fairly small percentage of the 30,000–60,000 large population which was also made up of women, enslaved people and foreign-born residents.
Ostracism did not happen automatically, the assembly had to vote each year in favour of holding one and often they were not called. In the 71-year period that ostracisms took place (487 BCE — 416 BCE), only 13 individuals were ostracised.
If the vote was to be held, the actual ostracism poll would happen two months later. The voting process was called the ostracophoria, meaning ‘election to ostracise’.
The unlucky individual who ‘won’ the vote had 10 days to put their affairs in order before they had to leave with no* possibility of return before a decade was up. If one did try to reenter Athens during this time, they faced the possibility of the death penalty.
Despite these harsh terms, an ostracised individual was still allowed to keep any property they owned and could still be considered a citizen of Athens, which, as stated earlier, was a privilege which was not extended to everyone. Further, on return to Athens, it seemed that little changed for the outcast and they could return to politics with significant social status.
No politician was safe from ostracism and it was extremely common for a senior member of the state to have to take a 10-year ‘break’ from Athens due to the vote. One such example was Themistocles, a non-aristocratic politician and general of the 5th-6th centuries BCE who had succeeded in leading Greece to triumph over their enemy, Persia. At one point, Themistocles was one of the most famous and important politicians in Athens, meaning that he was a threat to democracy.
The pieces of ostracon above hold the names, top to bottom, of Pericles (politician and general), Cimon (politician and general), and Aristides (politician). Pericles is the man who put into motion the building program that created the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis. Aristides is one of the lucky banished men who actually got to return to Athens before his ten years were up. Aristides was ostracised in 482 BCE but was recalled to the city-state in 479 BCE to help Athens get ready for the upcoming war against Persia.
Although the purpose of the ostracism was to vote out somebody who became too powerful, it’s likely many people just voted for the person they liked the least. Some of the votes found in ancient rubbish dumps seem to have had a message of personal grievance. Some names had the added epithets of “traitor”, “slanderer” or “adulterer”. The politician Cimon, whose name can be seen on a piece of ostracon in the above picture, had his personal scandal alluded to by at least one angry voter. Smithsonian Magazine writes that one ostracon had the words “Kimon Miltiadou, take Elpinike and go!” etched onto it, Elpinike being the half-sister he was rumoured to have had an affair with.
For better or for worse, the last ostracism took place in Athens in 416 BCE.
Should we bring ostracism back? It seems like a much faster and more efficient way of non-violently removing people from authority, than the bureaucracy that keeps politicians in check today. I, for one, am a fan.

Imagine walking in the footsteps of the greatest thinkers of all time, witnessing their lively debates, learning from their wisdom, and participating in their democracy. This is what it was like to visit the Agora of Athens, the heart and soul of ancient Greece.
The Agora was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
In this article, we will take you on a virtual tour of the Agora of Athens, and show you how you can think like a Greek. We will explore the fascinating world of the philosophers, who challenged the status quo, questioned everything, and sought the truth. We will also discover the secrets of the citizens, who practiced direct democracy, exercised their rights and duties, and defended their freedom. And we will admire the beauty of the gods, who inspired awe, devotion, and art.
Are you ready to embark on this journey? Then let’s go to the Agora of Athens, and learn how to think like a Greek.
The Agora was the birthplace of Western philosophy, where Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle taught and debated. These three philosophers are known as the founders of the classical tradition of philosophy, and their ideas have influenced countless thinkers and fields of study throughout history. But who were they, and what did they teach?
Socrates was the oldest and most controversial of the three philosophers. He was born around 470 BC, and he spent most of his life in the Agora, engaging in conversations with anyone who would listen. He did not write anything himself, but his words and deeds were recorded by his followers, especially Plato.
Socrates was famous for his method of questioning everything and everyone, often annoying the authorities and the public. He believed that the only way to find the truth was to examine one’s own beliefs and assumptions, and to expose the contradictions and ignorance that lay beneath them. He once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
Socrates was interested in ethical and political questions, such as what is justice, what is virtue, and how should one live. He claimed that he did not know the answers, but that he was seeking them with the help of his interlocutors. He also claimed that he was guided by a divine voice, or a daimon, that warned him of what not to do.
Socrates’ relentless questioning and criticism of the established norms and values of his society earned him many enemies, especially among the powerful and the wealthy. He was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety, and he was brought to trial in 399 BC. He defended himself with eloquence and wit, but he refused to compromise his principles or to escape from prison. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
Socrates’ death was a tragic and heroic event that marked the end of an era, but also the beginning of a legacy. His followers, especially Plato, continued his mission of seeking the truth and questioning the conventional wisdom. Socrates became a symbol of courage, wisdom, and integrity, and his example inspired generations of philosophers and thinkers.
Plato was the most devoted and influential student of Socrates. He was born around 428 BC, and he came from a wealthy and noble family. He was interested in poetry and politics, but he abandoned these pursuits after meeting Socrates and becoming his disciple. He followed Socrates everywhere, and he recorded his dialogues and teachings in his writings.
Plato was the founder of the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He established the Academy in 387 BC, near the sacred grove of Academus, outside the walls of Athens. The Academy was a place where students and scholars could study and discuss various subjects, such as mathematics, astronomy, music, and philosophy. The Academy attracted many brilliant minds, such as Aristotle, Euclid, and Archimedes.
Plato was the author of many dialogues, which are considered the most important and influential works of philosophy. In his dialogues, he used the form of a conversation between Socrates and other characters, such as his friends, enemies, or famous figures. He used this form to explore various topics, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, morality, beauty, and justice. He also used this form to present his own views and arguments, often through the mouth of Socrates.
Plato was an idealist, who believed that there was a higher and perfect realm of ideas, or forms, that existed beyond the physical and changing world. He believed that the forms were the true essence and models of everything that exists, and that they could only be known by reason and intuition. He also believed that the forms were the source of goodness, beauty, and justice, and that the goal of human life was to achieve harmony and alignment with them. He once said, “Philosophy begins in wonder.”
Plato was also a visionary, who imagined the ideal state and the ideal ruler in his most famous dialogue, the Republic. In the Republic, he argued that the state should be governed by the philosopher-king, who had the knowledge and the virtue to rule wisely and justly. He also argued that the state should be divided into three classes, according to their natural abilities and roles: the guardians, who were the rulers and protectors; the auxiliaries, who were the soldiers and helpers; and the producers, who were the farmers and craftsmen. He also argued that the state should provide education, censorship, and eugenics, to ensure the harmony and stability of the society.
Plato’s ideas and writings have had a profound and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most original thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
Aristotle was the most brilliant and prolific student of Plato. He was born in 384 BC, in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He was the son of a physician, and he had a natural curiosity and interest in the natural world. He joined the Academy when he was 17 years old, and he stayed there for 20 years, until the death of Plato. He then left Athens and traveled to various places, such as Asia Minor, Lesbos, and Macedonia. He became the tutor of Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, who conquered most of the known world. He returned to Athens in 335 BC, and he founded his own school, the Lyceum, where he taught and wrote until his death in 322 BC.
Aristotle was the author of many works, which cover almost every field of knowledge, such as logic, ethics, politics, biology, physics, and metaphysics. He wrote in a systematic and analytical style, using observation, classification, and deduction. He was the first to develop a comprehensive and coherent system of philosophy, which aimed to explain the nature and causes of everything that exists.
Aristotle was an empiricist, who believed that knowledge was derived from experience and observation of the physical world. He rejected Plato’s theory of forms, and he argued that the essence and form of a thing were inseparable from its matter and substance. He also argued that the world was composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire, and that each element had a natural place and motion. He also argued that the world was governed by four causes: the material cause, which was the matter of a thing; the formal cause, which was the shape and structure of a thing; the efficient cause, which was the agent or force that produced a thing; and the final cause, which was the purpose or goal of a thing. He once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
Aristotle was also a practical and ethical thinker, who was interested in the best way of living and the best form of government. He wrote the Nicomachean Ethics, which is considered one of the most influential works of moral philosophy. In the Nicomachean Ethics, he argued that the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life was happiness, which he defined as the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. He also argued that there were two types of virtue: intellectual virtue, which was acquired by learning and reasoning; and moral virtue, which was acquired by habit and practice. He also argued that virtue was a mean between two extremes, or vices, and that it required practical wisdom and moral judgment.
Aristotle also wrote the Politics, which is considered one of the most influential works of political philosophy. In the Politics, he argued that the state was a natural and necessary institution, which arose from the human need for social and political association. He also argued that there were different types of states, according to their constitution and their aim. He classified the states into six categories, based on the number and the quality of the rulers: monarchy, aristocracy, and polity, which were the good forms; and tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy, which were the bad forms. He also argued that the best form of state was the polity, which was a mixed and balanced constitution, where the middle class had the power and the common good was the aim.
Aristotle’s ideas and writings have had a tremendous and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
The Agora was also the center of Athenian democracy, where citizens voted and served as jurors. Athens was the first city-state to adopt a system of direct democracy, where every male citizen had the right and the duty to participate in the government. The Agora was where they gathered to elect magistrates, pass laws, and decide on war and peace. The Agora was also where they held trials, where citizens acted as both judges and jurors. One of the most famous trials was that of Socrates, who was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
But what exactly was democracy? And how did it work in Athens?
The word democracy means “rule by the people” in ancient Greek. It was a radical and revolutionary idea, that challenged the traditional forms of government, such as monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. It was based on the principle of equality, that all citizens had the same rights and responsibilities, regardless of their wealth, status, or birth. It was also based on the principle of freedom, that all citizens had the liberty to express their opinions, to choose their leaders, and to hold them accountable.
Democracy in Athens was not the same as democracy today. It was a direct and participatory democracy, where citizens made decisions by themselves, without representatives or intermediaries. It was also an exclusive and limited democracy, where only adult male citizens had the right to vote, while women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. It was also a fragile and unstable democracy, where factions, conflicts, and coups threatened its survival.
Democracy in Athens was practiced mainly in two institutions: the Assembly and the Courts. The Assembly was the main legislative and executive body, where citizens met at least once a month, and sometimes more often, to discuss and vote on various issues, such as laws, decrees, taxes, treaties, and wars. The Assembly was open to all citizens, who could attend, speak, and vote. The Assembly was also the supreme authority, that could elect, appoint, or dismiss magistrates, such as generals, treasurers, or archons. The Assembly was also the sovereign body, that could revise, amend, or abolish the constitution, or the fundamental laws of the state.
The Courts were the main judicial body, where citizens served as judges and jurors. The Courts were divided into several types, according to the nature and the amount of the cases, such as civil, criminal, public, or private. The Courts were composed of a large number of citizens, who were selected by lot, or randomly, from a pool of volunteers. The Courts were independent and autonomous, that could not be influenced or controlled by the Assembly or the magistrates. The Courts were also powerful and decisive, that could impose penalties, such as fines, exile, or death.
Democracy in Athens was a remarkable and unprecedented experiment, that inspired and influenced many other states and civilizations. It was also a challenging and demanding system, that required the active and informed participation of the citizens. It was also a noble and admirable ideal, that sought to achieve the common good and the public interest.
The Agora was also the place where temples and altars were dedicated to various gods and goddesses. The ancient Greeks were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods, each with their own personality and domain. The Agora had shrines for Zeus, the king of the gods; Athena, the patron goddess of Athens; Apollo, the god of the sun and music; Ares, the god of war; and many others. The Agora was also where religious festivals and ceremonies were held, such as the Panathenaia, the most important festival in honor of Athena. The festival included athletic contests, musical competitions, sacrifices, and a procession that carried a new robe for the statue of Athena.
But who were these gods and goddesses? And how did they influence the life and culture of the ancient Greeks?
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the personifications of the natural forces and phenomena, such as the sky, the sea, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the fire, the thunder, the rain, and the seasons. They were also the patrons and protectors of various aspects of human life, such as love, war, wisdom, justice, beauty, agriculture, commerce, and art. They were also the ancestors and relatives of the heroes and the legends, such as Hercules, Perseus, and Jason.
The ancient Greeks had a complex and rich mythology, that explained the origin and the history of the world, the gods, and the humans. They believed that the world was created by Chaos, the primordial void, from which emerged the first gods, such as Gaia, the earth; Uranus, the sky; and Tartarus, the underworld. They also believed that the gods were involved in a series of conflicts and wars, such as the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians; and the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the Olympians. They also believed that the gods interacted and intervened in the affairs of the humans, sometimes helping, sometimes harming, and sometimes falling in love with them.
The ancient Greeks worshipped and honored the gods in various ways, such as building temples and altars, making sacrifices and offerings, performing rituals and ceremonies, and holding festivals and games. They also sought the favor and the guidance of the gods, by consulting oracles and diviners, by making vows and prayers, and by following omens and signs. They also feared and respected the gods, by obeying their laws and commands, by avoiding their wrath and punishment, and by accepting their fate and will.
The ancient Greeks also expressed their admiration and devotion to the gods through art and literature, such as sculpture, painting, pottery, poetry, and drama. They created magnificent and realistic statues of the gods, such as the statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They also depicted the gods and their stories on various objects, such as vases, coins, and jewelry. They also composed epic and lyrical poems about the gods and their deeds, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer, and the Theogony and the Works and Days by Hesiod. They also wrote and performed tragic and comic plays about the gods and their relations with the humans, such as the Oresteia by Aeschylus, the Oedipus Rex by Sophocles, and the Bacchae by Euripides.
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the sources of awe and art, that inspired and influenced the life and culture of the ancient Greeks. They were also the symbols and the expressions of the values and the ideals of the ancient Greeks, such as courage, wisdom, beauty, and justice. They were also the reflections and the projections of the hopes and the fears of the ancient Greeks, such as love, war, fate, and death.
The Agora of Athens was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens witnessed the rise and fall of the Athenian democracy, the glory and tragedy of the Greek civilization, and the birth and development of the Western thought. It was the place where Socrates questioned and challenged, where Plato dreamed and idealized, where Aristotle observed and analyzed, where citizens voted and debated, where gods were worshipped and honored, and where art and literature were created and celebrated.
The Agora of Athens is a place that still inspires us today, and that we can learn from and admire. It is a place that reminds us of the achievements and the challenges of the human spirit, of the values and the ideals of the human society, and of the hopes and the fears of the human condition.
If you ever have the chance to visit Athens, don’t miss the opportunity to see the Agora for yourself. You will feel like you are traveling back in time, and you will discover the roots of Western civilization. You will also feel like you are connecting with the ancient Greeks, and you will understand their worldview and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens is not just a historical site. It is a living and breathing museum, where you can see, touch, and feel the history, the culture, and the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. It is also a vibrant and lively square, where you can meet, talk, and interact with the modern Greeks, who are the descendants and the inheritors of the ancient Greeks.
The Agora of Athens is a place where you can think like a Greek, act like a Greek, and be like a Greek. It is a place where you can experience the past, the present, and the future of the Greek civilization. It is a place where you can find yourself, lose yourself, and rediscover yourself.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you will never forget, and that you will always remember. It is a place that will change you, and that you will change. It is a place that will challenge you, and that you will challenge. It is a place that will inspire you, and that you will inspire.
The Agora of Athens is a place that awaits you, and that you await. It is a place that welcomes you, and that you welcome. It is a place that invites you, and that you invite.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should visit, and that you will visit. It is a place that you should see, and that you will see. It is a place that you should know, and that you will know.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should love, and that you will love.

This artwork contains the presence of humans. There are many people gathering up against each other while doing what seems to be studying. Proven by the books they carried and read, these figures represent all of the greatest mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists that lived in that specific decade. Dozens of these geniuses all gathered around to discuss, sharing their ideas, expressing their opinions, and learning from each other. The architectural yet enormous building is mostly painted white. Some figures lay on the ground, reading and conversing. Some are upstairs gathering together, making a little crowd. The color palette was mostly vibrant, but washed out. Yet you can still see the soft contrast between the people’s clothes and backgrounds.
The artist used shapes such as cubes, rounded, and curved to create perspectives on the architectural building. At the front, we can see the building’s perspective from the curved line on the roof. But the overall structure of the building was probably cubed or a block. These different and neatly spread types of shapes made the artwork look more composed. The whole composition looked like it was moving. Because the artist made designs of people interacting with one another, they also made the color palette soft, so it radiates peacefulness. The central interest of this artwork is the two main characters that were painted in the middle of the commotion. It was obvious to spot them since the other individuals were all gathering around them. The artist succeeded in gaining my attention to the two by highlighting the middle of the painting. As you can see, the area where they stand is a bit lighter than the rest. Such little details make the biggest difference when it comes to painting.
The painting took place during the historical era of Plato. Let’s analyze the most distinctive element, which is the two people that were standing in the middle. Research claims that the two characters happen to be Plato and Aristotle. Plato was wearing red and purple. This color symbolizes the color of spirituality. A color that inspires reflection and self-awareness. While Aristotle was wearing blue with brown, which symbolizes the sky, sea, and earth, it also represents reliability and wisdom. These are the two main elements that the artist wanted to show through the main characters. The overall mood of the painting has a sign of coolness and warmth at the same time. The cool color tones that were used actually made the mood warm because the amount of commotion made the painting somewhat peaceful and relaxing to see. The landscape came off as natural, as the painting used a little bit of green for the building, so the piece itself was naturalistic. The object of the monument was already perfect because it holds and completes the inside of the painting, which is the people.
Paragraph one explains what is happening in the painting. We already knew they were discussing and trying to express their thoughts. This represents all of the different opinions and answers between people. The painting shows us geniuses. Mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. Yet they are gathering together, trying to find and gain answers. This shows that everyone can disagree with one another. They can have different thoughts and philosophies about one case. The artist is trying to say that even if we are concerned and confused about a single matter, humans will try to find a way to solve it. The main theme behind this piece is the high Renaissance. If I were inside The School of Athens, I would probably try to catch up on the topic that was being discussed, so I wouldn’t feel left out. The story behind this art is that it’s positioned facing Disputa and symbolizes philosophy, setting up a contrast between religious and lay beliefs. The painting is abstract because it looks at other non-objective artistic elements of shape, form, and color. The artist explored his ideas beyond the canvas and physical reality. I would explain this artwork as a painting where people gathered up all their ideas. As proven by the painting itself and the dozen people there.
Raphael had created a masterpiece and expressive drawing. The soft and cool tones he used added to the overall feeling of composure, calm, and relaxation. The unseen movement between the people makes me feel at ease just by looking at it. The faint green tones developed a sign of liveliness and nature. For me personally, this artwork does not need any improvements, as it is already perfect and has met the criteria for being the aesthetic theory of Renaissance art.

Initially, I was skeptical. In the age of Covid, do people even attend conferences anymore? With free educational content on YouTube and virtual conferences on Zoom, what’s the point? Despite my doubts, I found myself driving to Athens to participate in Devoxx 2023. Devoxx Greece is a three-day event where developer communities gather to discover the latest technological advancements, presented by some of the most inspiring speakers in the industry. The Devoxx family, which includes Belgium, France, UK, Poland, Marocco, and Ukraine, welcomes over 15,000 Devoxxians annually!
To my surprise, the conference was exceptionally well-organized, and the turnout was impressive. Four large rooms were filled with enthusiastic attendees, eager to absorb the knowledge shared in each session. The talks were organized into the following tracks: Architecture, Containers & Infrastructure, Data & AI, Development Practices, Java, UI & UX, Programming Languages, and Security. In this post, I will share my impressions and key takeaways from the talks I attended.
But first some pictures from the venue and the event.
Let’s see some of the main points for the talks that I had attended and enjoyed :-)
Ted aimed to bridge the gap between developers and managers in his well-prepared talk, which was filled with numerous real-life examples from his own experiences. The presentation focused on the key responsibilities of managers, such as assembling strong teams rather than just hiring star programmers, fostering an environment that helps developers achieve a state of flow, minimizing disruptions by reducing unnecessary meetings, and even making tough decisions like relocating or dismissing individuals who negatively impact team dynamics.
Natalie, a Community Ambassador for OpenAI, showcased the latest advancements in AI, specifically focusing on transformers. One notable takeaway from her presentation was the introduction of Phind, an impressive AI-powered search engine designed for developers. This innovative tool not only cites sources but also automatically generates follow-up questions, among other features.
Apache Kafka has become the go-to standard for high-performance data streaming applications. Such applications are rarely focused solely on message processing; they often need to integrate Kafka messages with remote endpoints, store messages in a datastore, or relay them to third-party services.
Ozan from Red Hat showcased how Quarkus, combined with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, can be used to build Kafka-based event-driven architectures. Quarkus is a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework designed for creating Java applications. Using a sample application, Ozan demonstrated the key concepts and common patterns, illustrating how Quarkus simplifies the development of event-driven microservices and integrates seamlessly with Quarkus’ reactive core.
What an incredible talk! Dan delved into a fascinating concept: leveraging the untapped potential of a company’s computers by running tasks in Chrome tabs. Each tab functions as an isolated environment and boasts a robust API. So, why not utilize the browsers within an organization to act as containers for running workloads, ultimately saving money on servers? I’m eager to get my hands on the source code he demonstrated!
Eliza from Amity showed how she can effectively create with the help of Generative models technical (code) and nontechnical presentations with a clear structure, slides with bullet points, images, and or even videos.
Jane introduced us to Qwik, a novel JavaScript framework that employs a unique rendering paradigm called “resumability.” This approach allows a JavaScript app to be serialized into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique commonly used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. Qwik enables the creation of “resumable apps” that require minimal JavaScript for interactivity and employ fine-grained lazy loading to load only the necessary components. Jane’s talk provided guidance on getting started with Qwik.
The key points covered in her presentation included: understanding the Qwik framework, comparing Qwik to React and Angular, strategies for reducing the size of JS bundles, and a tutorial on building with Qwik. The presentation piqued my interest, and I’m eager to give Qwik a try.
Dionysis, the Director of DevOps at GWI, showed us OPA: Open Policy Agent, which makes it possible to write policies that test the changes Terraform is about to make before it makes them. Also, he combined OPA with another open-source tool called infracost that calculates the cost of a terraform plan. This way he can also test and limit the cost of a terraform plan before actually applying it. Nice ideas for our DevOps!
Frank, a principal at Databricks, delivered a lively and engaging presentation on Data Lakehouse, a new platform from Databricks that blends the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. This innovative approach provides the reliability, robust governance, and performance associated with data warehouses, while also offering the openness, flexibility, and machine learning support characteristic of data lakes. Essentially, data is stored at the S3 level, but ACID transactions can be performed on top of it. An important takeaway from the presentation was that the term “real-time pipelines” may be somewhat misleading, as there is always a slight latency. Additionally, Frank introduced the appealing concept of continuously ingesting all data and replacing traditional ELT pipelines with streaming pipelines — truly cutting-edge ideas!
Emilia, a software engineer specializing in mobile gaming technologies, shared insights from psychology and cognitive sciences to illustrate how their application can lead to more effective user experiences, both positively and negatively.
Key topics covered in her presentation included dual process theory, heuristics, the illusory truth effect, the paradox of choice, priming, and inadvertent priming, among others.
(Note to myself from the talk: The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over other from William James)
In his presentation, Mohammed, an avid Formula 1 enthusiast, explored how we can make our code deployments as secure as Formula 1 races. Drawing from various principles employed in F1, he demonstrated how we can learn from and adopt these concepts in the way we design, structure, deliver, and safeguard our systems.
The talk covered:
+ Importance of having a trusted and adversarial CI/CD pipeline
+ Security patterns: Least privileged principal, defence in depth, Zero trust
+ Resiliency patterns: Micro-segmentation, Anti-overload patterns
+ Monitoring and alerting
In Cassandra’s presentation, she offered a wealth of both theoretical and practical guidance on leveraging social media, podcasting, and YouTube to establish a meaningful personal brand that not only benefits one’s career but also contributes to the community. These platforms have evolved from simply being enjoyable ways to share our lives and connect with others to becoming essential tools for networking and career advancement. During the talk, attendees heard about individuals whose personal brands played a key role in their success as esteemed developers, managers, and community leaders. Participants learned how to utilize their online presence for career growth and received valuable insights on best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for striking a balance between professional and personal content.
In this presentation, Chris discusses the approach they devised for executing chaos engineering scenarios. The aim was to conduct exercises for new team members, acquainting them with alarms and the complete incident response procedure to ensure their preparedness for real situations. He demonstrated the rationale behind conducting such experiments, the design process, implementation, and ultimately, the evaluation and application of the solution.
This is a brief summary of some of the talks I attended. I’d like to thank the Devoxx team for organizing such a professionally-run conference. The audience was genuinely enthusiastic, and many valuable and meaningful conversations and connections took place. Be sure to visit Devoxx’s official website or Facebook page. I’ll attempt to share my impressions of the remaining talks in a future post.

What is Western Civilization and where did it come from?
This is the question I have been seeking answers to which has guided much of my reading. Today, those answers are coming from Jacob Howland’s book, Plato and the Talmud.
I first heard of the idea that Western Civilization is a combination of Athens and Jerusalem from Ben Shapiro in his book The Right Side of History. It made some sense to me then but the more I dig, the more sense it makes. There is a resistance for some people to understand and even admit that much of our culture is Biblically derived, but I don’t see any way around it.
At this point, I don’t think anyone can understand Western Civilization without an understanding of the Bible in the same way that we would expect them to understand Greek philosophy. And when someone tries to convince me otherwise, I take it as evidence that they don’t understand our civilization and will not until they get over that hump.
What Howland is doing in this book is comparing those two distinct lines of thought and describing their similarities and their differences.
One major difference which I have suspected is a key ingredient in the Bible missing from…

Before you start reading, I bet you’re wondering what exactly is a Perrucha: it is not any type of dog, or parrot (as in French), it is simply a term of endearment for those who feel independent, like to explore, to discover (and discover themselves), or what Charli XCX called a Brat. It means someone who is open minded and likes to have fun, and to mix with real people. If you’d like to visit only fancy places, there are other guides for you. When I visit a city, in Perrucha mode, I like to let the city tell a story, of the good and the bad sides, everything that makes it what it is.
As for Athens, you will se it has graffiti, the Acropolis, beautiful museums, sandy beaches, a vibrant music scene, an anarchist neighborhood, and one of the most welcoming people I have ever met. And just wait till you taste the food!
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home. Coming from a Latin American city, I believe it was the mix of beauty and chaos which won me over. Ever since, I’ve felt the need to return and keep exploring. I hope this guide will give you some tips that go beyond the main touristic areas and things to do, the same way I like to share my recommendations with my friends (this way I can also get them to read what I write).
If you are an international traveler, you will probably get to Athens by air -to the international airport Eleftherios Venizelos, commonly initialised as AIA-, or by sea -to Piraeus Port. If you get to the Port, you can easily take Line 3 to the city center, to the airport, or just get a taxi.
Going to the city center from the airport has quickly improved in the past 10 years, now you can just take the line 3 of the metro directly — approximated cost is 9€ per person. A trip to the city center (Syntagma Square), will take approximately 40 minutes. Uber is connected to the Taxi services, which you can also take to and from the airport.
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home…
You can order taxis via Uber and Freenow (only official taxis exist and use the meter), or take the metro/buses (as the metro won’t take you everywhere). The metro is quite clean and useful to get to and from the international airport.
In the Greek capital, I would say most of the people speak English, and all over Greece the road signs are in both Greek and English, I imagine because Greek is not so popular outside Greece. However, once you move to more retired places, having Google translate (or other apps) comes in handy, even if the younger generations speak English, you may find yourself ordering random items on the menu. In any case, people will most of the times be ready to help you, even if they don’t speak your language.
In short, with a metro card, basic English, and a positive attitude, you can easily move around.
You have two main areas you can choose from: enjoy the historical city center, or stay somewhere closer to the beach.
If you prefer the historical city center, you can try areas such as Plaka and Koukaki, which are walking distance to the Acropolis and full of restaurants and bars. You also have easy access to the metro. This areas are mainly touristic, especially Plaka; I personally prefer Koukaki for its chill vibes and it still walking distance to famous monuments like the Acropolis.
I would avoid areas such as Omonia and Monistiraki, even though they might offer cheaper options, they’re very busy and not as charming as other areas. The same goes for Pireas Port area, it’s not a place to hang out, unless you want to photograph ferries.
On a whole other vibe there is Exarcheia, the anarchist neighborhood. The neighborhood features a maze of architectural styles, bohemian shops, second-hand stores, record shops, and bookstores. Also amazing bars and restaurants for really good prices.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area. Since there is no metro to go there (there might be in the future), the closer you stay to the beach, the cheaper the taxi (duh). If you go further South, you can even visit Vouliagmeni Lake, also worth seeing.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area.
There is also an option in between the historical city center and the beaches: Paleo Firios, which is walking distance from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, an iconic building housing a library, an opera, a rooftop, and it’s a more residential neighborhood.
First and foremost, in Plaka neighborhood, go all the way up to the Acropolis. In front, instead of paying to enter the museum, which is empty (you can see the pieces in the British or Louvre Museums), just go to the museum restaurant and take pictures from there.
On Sundays see the change of guard in Syntagma Square.
Walk around Monastiraki square. See Filopapo’s hill (Socrates Prison) for the view (Colina Filopappou). If you have extra time you can go up the Mount Likavittos up the hill’s transport.
Walk around Exarcheia (the anarchist neighborhood) and discover the restaurants and cafés in a unique setting.
See Renzo Piano’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation if you can (on your way to Pireas port). The sunset from the rooftop bar is breathtaking. From June to August, you can also enjoy a free Open Air Cinema at night.
I insist for the beach lovers: make sure to check out the Vouliagmeni area, there’s even a Lake with a fancy spa. Most people skip the beaches in Athens, but to me they’re worth the visit, plus, the prices are quite affordable, even for the beach clubs.
There’s the small area of Mikrolimano next to the port with nice restaurants and a gorgeous view.
You can take a day trip to see the Delphos Oracle.
You can buy cosmetic products made with olive oil and honey. Just for the fun, go check out Greek pharmacies, they have the best natural cosmetics, a perfect souvenir.
For sports fans: you can visit the city’s multiple stadiums, be that the Olympic Complex built by renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Olympiacos F.C. Stadium near Pireaus, or the AEK Athens F.C. Agia Sophia Stadium in Nea Filadelfia. The locals I talked to are fervent fans of the AEK Athens F.C. and love the atmosphere.
A plus: a 40-minute drive from Athens, you can visit the APIVITA Cosmetics factory. If you’re my friend, you know I wish they would sponsor me since I use all of their products: they’re made of honey or olive oil. The factory visit is free of charge and you can buy their products at factory prices (located at Markopoulo Mesogaias).
Greece has rich culinary traditions and excellent quality ingredients, so it is not too hard to find good food, coffee and wine wherever you go. In my experience, Athens is one of the best cities in the world for cocktails, the attention to detail and creativity is impressive (also for the prices).
My personal favorites are the following:
· Fried cheese in all forms (cheese beignets, cheese pie)- the cheese can be Feta or Saganaki.
· Eel, squid and fish.
· Eggplant salad (spread).
· Greek salad Saganaki gambas (or anything in Saganaki -red- sauce).
· Mezze: small plates to share.
· Souvlaki (meat on a stick).
· Greek Yogurt with fruits, nuts and honey.
· Iced coffee: Greeks take iced coffee very seriously (as anyone should), hence you will have some of the best iced coffee, no matter the way you order it.
· Alcohol: most beers are pils, for darker beers try micro breweries (mostly in Athens).
· Grape liquors: Ouzo, Raki/Tsipouro — with or without Anis, Masticha, Wines.
Greece is a great place to be a vegetarian or vegan, as they have the well-known Mediterranean diet with fresh cheese, tomatoes, olives, cucumber and olive oil.
· Mpakaliarákia (Greek food) — Kidathineon 41
· Lolos — Geor. Olimpiou 5
· Mikrolimano area (Greek food) — 16, Akti Koumoundourou 24
· Try fried feta cheese with honey, moussaka (like lasagna), souvlaki (meat on a stick). Honestly everything is delicious.
· Drink Raki, Ouzo, Tsipouro (with or without anis), Rakómelo and Mastiha.
· six d.o.g.s — Avramiotou 6–8
· Neratzia Café Bistró (great wine bar) — Zan Moreas 6
· Tranzistor — Protogenous 10
· Baba au rum — Klitiou 6
· Rosalia — Valtetsiou 59
· Bolivar Beach Club — Leof. Poseidonos, Alimos 174 55
· Attic Urban Rooftop — Ermou 86
· Migniardise — Veikou 30
· Plaka is great for shopping for souvenirs such as clothes, magnets, food and cosmetics.
· Syd Records — Protogenous 13
· Athens Tattoo Studio — my favorite artist there is @boss_667ttt
· The prices are competitive, so look for the one closest to you and try it out.
Disclosure: make sure to check the listed places on Google Maps to see if they’re still running.
If you have anything you think I missed, feel free to share in the comments.
Having seen Athens, you can take a ferry and continue your trip to the islands, or take a train or car and see the inner part of the country.

Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP) is the largest water utility in Greece providing services to 4.3 million customers. Read how EYDAP is reducing water-energy nexus pressures.
By Robert C. Brears*
EYDAP has launched an ambitious program of renewable energy utilization with the objective of contributing to the optimization of the energy balance across the country and society and exploring the possibility of expanding to new profitable business. The water utility’s involvement in energy can be grouped into the areas of hydropower, cogeneration of heat and power, solar energy, and energy reduction initiatives.
Hydropower
Along the aqueduct system that brings raw water into the Athens area for treatment there are existing energy dissipation works (small waterfalls along the aqueduct). EYDAP is in process of converting these energy dissipation works into energy production plants, therefore taking advantage of the aqueducts’ hydropower potential. These energy production plants consist of temporarily redirected water flowing through a turbine that converts the hydraulic energy potential into electricity by use of a generator. The water then rejoins the aqueduct at a lower elevation and continues its flow to the water treatment plant. To date, EYDAP has constructed six small hydropower plants along its aqueducts located in Kirfi (760 kW), Elikona (650 kW), Kartala Kihairona (1,200 kW), Mandra (630 kW), Evinos Dam (820 kW), and Klidi (590 kW).
Cogeneration
At Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant, which receives 730,000 m³ of wastewater per day, biogas is captured to produce electricity and thermal energy at the Psyttalia heat and power cogeneration plants, with total wattage being 11.4 MWe and a thermal force of 17.3 MWth.
Solar energy
EYDAP has already licensed production for a photovoltaic power station that generates 1,971 MW on its premises of Aharnes. The contract will enable the selling of electricity to the Hellenic Electricity Officer. In addition, EYDAP is exploring the possibility of constructing smaller photovoltaic plants at other company locations.
Energy conservation
EYDAP has designed an intensive program of energy saving in buildings and facilities including energy inspections and energy saving advice. The utility is also undertaking preventative maintenance to achieve the best possible maintenance and extension of lifetime energy-intensive plant equipment to save energy. The overall aim of EYDAP is to save energy by maximizing the management of existing building equipment without making additional investments with excessive costs.
Multiple benefits
By developing renewable energy systems and undertaking energy conservation measures EYDAP is realizing multiple benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, additional income from trading carbon rights or green certificates, and new employment opportunities.
The take-out
By embracing renewable energy and energy conservation, water utilities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills, all the while offering employment opportunities.

The Greeks planted colonies widely, from Istanbul to Marseilles to Alexandria. And scattered all over the Mediterranean you will find remains of Greek temples (Wikipedia’s (incomplete) list notes 43 of them; it would be a good project for people to add to that list). But which — whether due to their preservation, or their setting, or their architectural value — are the best to visit? We’ve criss-crossed the Mediterranean in pursuit of the best, and we’re happy to share our list with you.
Overshadowed by the more spectacular Acropolis in Athens, the Hephaestion is under-appreciated. One of the very best preserved of all Greek temples (look at that ceiling!), it’s a must-see for any visitor to Athens. Set in a pleasant if slightly bland park — it’s easy to feel disconnected from the urban fabric of Athens here — it’s not difficult to find a shady place to watch the play of light on the temple’s myriad carved surfaces. Long known as the Theseum and a favorite of 19th century artists, it’s a must-see for lovers of ancient architecture.
In school you hear about Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns, but almost all the best-preserved Greek temples are Doric. At Didyma (Didim, in southwest Turkey) you’ll get your best opportunity to appreciate the Ionic: the Temple of Apollo Didymaios. Be prepared to be impressed: the temple’s platform is almost 400 feet long, and supported an incredible forest of 116 columns each more than six feet in diameter and 60 feet high. Admiring what is left, you begin to grasp the first reason why we have so little of the Ionic: these temples were lofty, ambitious structures. Sixty-foot columns don’t typically stand earthquakes, and when they fall, they shatter. But the Ionic style isn’t only to be admired for its size. These are some of the most elegant, beautiful ruins you will ever see: giant Medusa-heads watch over the ruins, exquisite reliefs ring the column bases, and everything is made of a gleaming marble whose beauty you have to see to believe. The vast temple enclosed an open-air court, where were kept a spring and laurel sacred to Apollo. Bring your Herodotus with you: the sanctuary — generally referred to as “Branchidae” by Herodotus, for the family that maintained the temple — was a key player in the Ionian Revolt, and Father of History recounts all the steps that led to its destruction in 494 B.C.
Delphi, easily reached from Athens, is one of the most touristed places in Greece. But it’ll take a lot more visitors to ruin this incredible mountain sanctuary. Tucked away in a valley the Greeks thought resembled a uterus (delphus), it’s still one of the most spectacular religious sites in the world. The views alone are worth the trip. And while the actual structure of the temple probably won’t overwhelm you, the significance of the place, and the weight of so much emotional human history — for centuries, people came here in the thousands literally looking for answers — still can be felt today. The famed objects are almost all gone — the wooden staff offered by Brutus, Rome’s first consul, or the rich gifts left by Croesus — but reading Pausanias’s account of them all will serve to remind you that this little mountain village was in many ways the spiritual center of the ancient world.
If you think Delphi’s mountain scenery is spectacular, wait til you try a visit to Bassae, a truly remote Greek temple atop a mountain literally in the middle of Arcadia. Most of the year you’ll probably have the place pretty much to yourself, too — if you can get there (it’s accessible only by car or by an expensive taxi). It may be the best-preserved Greek temple in the world, and as such has been the subject of much academic study (and the first to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Supposedly designed by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon, this temple’s beauty and harmony were singled out for praise by Pausanias almost two thousand years ago. And just to see those columns, still standing on that summit after all these centuries, is enough to give the pious traveller chills. The interior frieze was carted off to the British Museum in 1814, where you can still admire it (Mary Beard and John Henderson made the frieze the starting-point for their 2000 volume, Classics: A Very Short Introduction, a suitable companion for your journey in Arcadia).
This site might well have taken the top spot on our list were it not for the fact that in 1987 an enterprising preservationist decided the temple needed to be protected, and that the right way to protect it was to put it beneath a gargantuan latex tent. As you drive up the winding road it appears that the mountain is now crowned not by an extraordinary ancient temple but something rather like a Cyclops’ discarded condom. The temporary structure — which is remarkable-looking on the inside, I will confess — has now been there for almost thirty years. To make matters worse, at times the “preservation works” inside take up all the area inside the tent, and visitors are allowed to visit only the front face of the temple. What was once perhaps the most spectacular place in all Greece is now at times almost completely off limits. Not only that, but the tent has spawned a whole brood of conspiracy theories (“what exactly are they hiding up there? ALIENS?”). But a trip up to this three-thousand-foot-high ridge is to see just how spectacular the Greek architectural imagination could be.
The mountains of Greece are remarkable, but when you think of Greece, you think first and foremost of the sea. The most glorious religious manifestation of this is the temple of Poseidon at Sounion. On a sea-girt promontory jutting into the Aegean, almost every ship bound for Athens came within sight of this clifftop shrine. The structure is decidedly ruinous, but the spectacular setting is forever memorable (as is the signature from Byron carved into one of the pillars). The site history is not complex here — there has been the temple and the sea and the rock and not much else. On summer evenings a crowd gathers at the temple to watch the sunset, with a pleasant holiday vibe. It’s touristy, but the spot is still appreciably wild: I’ve hiked all over the promontory and even camped out there to get a little time alone with the beach.
Cumae is the place where Daedalus landed (without Icarus) after flying away from the Labyrinth, and his wings were supposedly kept in the temple of Apollo there. There’s not much left of the temple today — just the foundations — but the location on an abandoned hillside in Italy overlooking the Mediterranean is second to none. It’s the setting of Book Six of the Aeneid too, and reading Vergil’s lines on-location at the temple will give you shivers. Factor in the remarkable cave structure there, the Roman roads climbing the acropolis, and the temples of Zeus and Artemis nearby, and this is one of the best archaeological sites in the whole Mediterranean. It’s undiscovered too — the crowds all head to Pompeii and Naples just to the south.
Selinunte is one of a trio of top-notch Greek temple sites in Sicily (the other two are Segesta and Agrigento), all of which make our list. On a high plain overlooking the sea and flanked by golden beaches, it’s pretty easy to have a good time at Selinunte: mornings with the temples, afternoons at the beach, and evenings at the clubs. Not only that, but Selinunte boasts five major temple structures and several minor ones sprawling over the largest archaeological park in Italy. “Temple E” (generally presumed to be a temple of Hera) makes for the best pictures — it was re-erected using the original stones — but the whole site is interesting, especially if you can get there before temperatures start to soar.
Once the home of the great warrior Ajax, Aegina, just across the Saronic Gulf from Athens, doesn’t get the love that the more distant Greek islands get, but this temple of the mysterious “disappeared” Earth goddess Aphaia (aphaia means “not appearing”) is something special. It sits atop a hill overlooking the sea, on a quiet part of the island far away from the crowds. The temples of the Acropolis and Sounion are actually visible from here, and there may have been some kind of communication in antiquity from temple to temple with watchfires. The panorama is all big sky, old stone, and blue sea, an essence of Greece refined up through twenty-five hundred years. The temple itself is Doric, from around 500 B.C., and the sculptures from its pediment — now in Munich — stand, like the temple itself, right in that happy borderland between the Archaic Greek period and the full Classical style.
Strolling through the flowery hillsides, you might find it hard to imagine that Segesta once was a city. Almost nothing of the place remains, a fact which makes its two principal ruins all the more striking: an impressively preserved stone theater and an even more perfectly preserved Doric temple. You start by the temple, its unfluted columns aging to the color of sand and ochre; the Sicilian sun marks time’s every stroke upon the stone with a casting of shadow; landscaped grounds display the sun-loving Sicilian vegetation. A half-mile walk up the hill brings you to the theater, cunningly built as most of them are, splendidly preserved and following the line of the hill. Turning back to see the temple set among fields, with the waters of the Mediterranean in the distance and even further beyond, the endless hills of Sicily, you get one of the world’s most picturesque views. Thomas Cole selected precisely this view to produce one of his best Grand Tour keepsake paintings. Past and present seem to join hands here. Even today the temple looks almost brand-new, as if a team of builders threw it up in the past month and have just gone home for the day before coming back tomorrow to put on the roof and give it a final paintjob.
We know, we know, we know: the crowds can be awful, the sun is so glaring your eyes start watering without sunglasses, it’s beastly hot in summer, and parts of the place get roped off for no apparent reason. But it’s the Parthenon, and there’s a reason the crowds keep showing up. The most iconic image of Ancient Greece, the temple of Athena Parthenos is still a standout among Greek temples, for its incredible position at the center of Greece’s greatest city, for the Doric proportions perfectly poised between airy elegance and stony heft, for the gorgeous Pentelic marble that seems to mirror the color of the sun in the sky — pink at sunrise, blinding white at midday, honey-colored in the afternoon — and because it’s the Parthenon. This is the chief monument of “the school of Hellas,” the tangible remainder of Periclean Athens. It’s hard not to be impressed when you’re there. And there’s the rest of the Acropolis to see too — from the Erechtheum on top to the theater of Dionysus below (yes, that theater). There’s a reason why this is all a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’re better off going off-season, but no one who loves Greek temples is going to want to miss this one.
The Italians have chutzpah, and at times it pays off. The temples at Paestum, just south of the Amalfi Coast, face onto a road. There are businesses along the road: a few hotels, a few restaurants, a few bars. This could be a disaster. But it’s not: it’s delightful, and it makes visiting Paestum a real pleasure. The last time I was there I visited a bar where couples and friends were lined up at tables just staring at the sun setting over the Temple of Athena. It seemed like some kind of perfect dream of Mediterranean life. And it’s Italy: the restaurants are fabulous (they’re famous for their mozzarella di bufala), the bars are fabulous. There’s even a hair salon with a temple view. And the temples themselves? They are perfect. Their names have changed over generations, but the one now known as the Temple of Poseidon is one of the standout works of antiquity. The etching Piranesi completed of it — perfectly capturing the mystery of all things old — is perhaps the master’s greatest work. That Paestum comprises multiple temples, that they are so accessible, that there are perfect vantage points from which to draw or contemplate them, that the beach is so close, that the walls of the city form another remarkable attraction reachable by short walks through the fields, that they are visited but not overcrowded, that the place is easily accessed from the train — all these things make a visit to Paestum one of the very best ways to experience Greek temple architecture.
Grand as all the temple sites of Magna Grecia are — Paestum, Segesta, and Selinunte are all on this list — the grandest of them all is Agrigento, the ancient Akragas, where a walk through a grove of almond and olive leads you from magnificent Greek temple to magnificent Greek temple, all of them perched on an impossibly photogenic ridge. The site is hot in summer but truly beautiful all throughout the year, thanks to the warm climate, sea views, and some gorgeous Mediterranean landscaping. The bloom of the almond trees in February is particularly stunning, and the wonderful spread of the site makes it a perfect botanical garden — it’s almost as if the ancients spaced out their temples to cater to the tourist experience.
The so-called Temple of Concordia is the star attraction, a splendidly preserved Doric temple in a warm buff stone, but the site boasts seven temples, all of which are worth visiting, and much besides: the remains of an “Atlas,” part of the temple of Zeus, shows its utterly unique temple design. Alone of all the Greek sites in Italy, the Valley of the Temples has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status. The adjacent town of Agrigento is a kind of miniature Sicily in itself, with ancient, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and modern buildings in a kind of glorious jumble. Olives, sunshine, sculpture, blossom, wine-dark sea, history laid upon history: if you want to get the experience of an ancient Greek temple, it’s pretty hard to beat Agrigento.
You don’t have to choose just one, of course. The best is to find a way to see them all. Have a favorite we left off our list? Feel free to add it in the comments.

(TW: Sexual Assault. Please read with care. Thank you.)
There were none wiser, stronger, or better than her, Athena, the Goddess of wisdom and strength, knew. Victory flowed fresh in her blood of gold — ichor. She had just won the battle of being the patron God of Athens and won from whom but her uncle, the God of the Waters himself! However, she knew Poseidon’s propensity to hold grudges. An attack could be on the way anytime soon. The caution did not stop her from savoring her spoils as her hungry eyes wandered over the capital, looking for a new conquest to engage her. Mortals could be the most entertaining species. Amidst the cacophony of the cosmopolitan city — hawkers crying, officials announcing, and buyers haggling, a mellifluous voice struck her ears.
“Goddess Athena!”
Few things managed to take Athena aback. The woman’s beauty happened to be one of them. Long, golden hair tumbled on her dusky face, which was adorned with a dainty nose and full, red lips. Her white robe contrasted against her skin. The woman was kneeling in the exquisitely built temple of marble, which had been devoted to the Goddess. The mortal continued to heap praises. Well aware of the protocol, the golden-haired maiden stood and draped an embroidered silver robe on Athena’s statue. Divine rays emanated from the statue as Athena deigned to appear in the temple.
“Goddess!” the woman gasped, falling on her knees.
“Rise, maiden.” Athena’s rich, deep voice reverberated in the temple. “What is your name, and whence do you come from?”
“Medusa is my name,” the mortal’s silky voice said. “I am the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto, minor lords of the sea.”
Athena’s eyes hardened. “Lords of the sea, you say?”
“The sea, Goddess. But I am here to devote my heart and soul to your service. I want to be the first priestess of this temple.”
Medusa looked into Athena’s eyes. A sudden current passed in the space between them. The mortal must have felt the exchange of sparks too, for she looked away, red rushing to her cheeks. Athena noticed the blueness of those frail mortal eyes — eyes that were bluer than the sky and deeper than the ocean. Yet, another factor attracted her. Those eyes seemed to contain intelligence and consideration more than most men.
“Answer me, then. What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?”
Medusa did not take time to think. “The answer should be a human. In the morning of life — our childhood — we crawl on all fours. At noon, which is adulthood, we walk upright on two legs. In the evening of our lives, we use a cane as a third leg.”
“Born of the earth, yet a gift divine,I thrive where the sun and soil align.A token of peace, a feast I provide,In oil or fruit, I’m prized worldwide.What am I?”
Medusa smiled in recognition. “Your gift to us, Goddess, what else? The people of Athens chose this over Poseidon’s salt water. They are your divinely provided olives.”
Athena continued to grill the woman — on policy, on Gods, on anthropology. Each answer seemed better than the previous and drew Athena closer, till she could hear the mortal’s breaths. Athena knew her presence overwhelmed mortals, yet the maiden held her ground.
“Last question for today,” Athena said.
“I cannot be seen, yet I color your view,I cannot be touched, yet I’m felt through and through.I can bind the mighty, or make the meek bold,A treasure eternal, yet never bought or sold.What am I?”
Athena watched Medusa’s lips as she spoke. “The answer is love, Goddess. The best and the worst feeling in the world.”
A rush of power hit Athena; a unique exhilaration and euphoria made their way to her heart. She could appreciate beauty with brains; she could appreciate a challenge. Medusa remained on her knees, awaiting the judgment.
“Call an official,” said Athena. “I have an important announcement to make.”
And so, one of Athena’s first and grandest temples in Athens got the perfect priestess. The duties, the offerings, and the devotion were at a level unseen by Athena before. At the dawn of every week’s first day, Athena used to appear in the temple to meet the priestess. The Goddess posed riddles, discussed the recent developments in Olympus, or simply shared silence with the mortal. Those times energized the Goddess more than ambrosia could. During those conversations, butterflies flew in Athena’s stomach, and she could see the yearning in the mortal’s eyes. For the time being, she decided to keep her distance and tease the mortal some more. The bountiful sparks added a new flavor to her life.
She looked forward to them eagerly.
Medusa swayed her way to the temple from her home. The sun was rising, the sea reflecting the sky’s oranges and pinks beautifully. A smile touched her lips. Maybe, today would be the day that Athena would close the distance between them. Perhaps Athena was waiting for her to make the move. After all, who would appreciate bravado more than her?
Today, Medusa decided. Today I would say it all.
Just then, drizzle began. Medusa increased her pace, knowing the temple was still a stretch away. Her gut was pounding. A shadow fell on her shoulder. The scent of salt water hit her nose.
“Young lady,” said a hoarse voice. “I have seen none finer than you.”
Medusa turned and gasped. A muscular man with blue robes and dark, long hair towered over her. Yet, he looked more ugly than desirable to her. She clutched her white robe, which told the world that she was devoted to Athena.
“God Poseidon,” Medusa managed to say. “T-thank you for your compliments. I was headed to Goddess Athena’s temple.”
Medusa immediately knew that was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone in Poseidon’s eyes. As he took a step forward, she took a step back, her hands quivering.
Athena, she prayed, over and over. Athena.
Clouds grew darker over her. Huge waves began forming in the sea and crashing over the coast. It seemed that the God grew in size. Medusa fell backwards. Her heart pounded loudly.
“Are you denying the chance to be with me, young lady? Isn’t your name Medusa? Aren’t you the daughter of minor lords under ME?”
“Have mercy,” Medusa said, slithering backwards. “Mercy, Lord, I apologize, I am already devoted to Goddess Athena. ATHENA.”
Thunder crackled. Poseidon fell on her, twisting her arm, making her turn over. Medusa went numb. A golden light flashed somewhere. Poseidon cursed. Momentarily, the weight was removed from her. Through her tears and blood, Medusa saw two great lights clashing. A shrill shriek dominated the air. In horror, she realized Poseidon was coming towards her again as a wounded beast. She tried to stand. A force other than Poseidon hit her then, throwing her back. Poseidon cursed again, his shout shaking the ground. A cold, brutal wave crashed on her. The last thing Medusa was aware of was Athena’s tear-stricken face.
It seemed that she had been unconscious for ages. The ground was hard below, and there was a constant hissing around. When the memories set in, Medusa sat up straight and horrified.
Was it a dream?
She found herself in a cave overlooking the sea. Looking around, she was shocked to see her cousins — the Gorgons — sleeping in the corner. Perhaps Athena had made them guard her. They had their hair as hundreds of tiny snakes, their faces grey and what was generally considered monstrous. The hissing of their snakes filled her head. There was a small pool of water on the other end of the cave. Feeling the thirst, Medusa wandered towards it. Her reflection was not something she was prepared for. That was why the hissing sounded too loud. Her scream was loud enough to disturb the sea.When her throat could scream no more, her ears caught the sound of sobbing. Even without turning, Medusa knew who the person was. Pain like no other twisted in her heart.
“Medusa,” said Athena, her voice cracking. Medusa turned. When once those blue eyes glittered at the sight of the Goddess, now there was only blankness.
Medusa opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. She closed her eyes, hot tears splashing on her cheeks. Whatever had happened had to be a dream. Soon, her body was rocked by hefty sobs. Athena kept apologizing in the background, her eyes as red and swollen.
“If only I had claimed you sooner,” said Athena. “Would that have made a difference?” The Goddess crawled closer to Medusa, whom she had transformed into another Gorgon. “I am sorry, Medusa. I am sorry. I love you. This seemed the only viable solution to drive Poseidon away.” The Goddess gulped. “I could not defeat him.”
Looking at Medusa’s defeated face, Athena grabbed her shoulders, her voice betraying the pain she felt. “Tell me.
“I linger unseen, a shadow in light,I burden the heart, both day and night.I grow with your secrets, thrive on your pain,I bind you in chains, yet leave no stain.What am I?”
Medusa finally stared in the grey eyes. “Guilt.”
Slowly, legends about Medusa spread.
Some of them claimed that she could turn people into stone just by looking at them. Heroes began to seek her out, to win the confidence and support of people around. Medusa’s peaceful life began to be poked at again, by men. Athena knew she had to do something. Every time she thought of the incident, a knife twisted in her chest. Soon, a quiet trip to Hades was made. As depressing and spooky as the underworld was, Athena knew it was the path to Medusa’s salvation. Hades was hard to bargain with, but the presence of Persephone helped. Promptly, two gilded swords that held the power to never miss a strike were transported to Hades. His part of the bargain would come later.
In the meanwhile, a young and promising hero named Perseus, the son of Zeus, was rising in popularity.
One night, Athena paid a visit to him and whispered his task. He had to behead Medusa as painlessly as possible and bring the head to the Goddess. Perseus did not question the specifics and accepted a shield for the task, a shield that shone brighter than gold, that reflected better than a mirror. The hero set off. Athena helped him whenever she could without making it obvious, until he reached the infamous Rock Island.
Athena watched with bated breath.
The day of the final encounter arrived. Perseus entered the cave in the middle of the day. That was usually the time when the Gorgons slept. The statues of people around did not help his nerves. He gripped the shield tightly, a royal sword hanging by his waist, and tiptoed where Medusa slept. The unevenness of the ground made him fumble. He tripped, making the other statues around him crash to the ground. Then, it was deathly silent. His heart stopped as he heard the snarl of Medusa, the hissing of her snakes.
The moment she turned to him, he lifted the shield.
Medusa faltered. Perseus, his eyes closed, swung his sword, praying his strike was right. He heard a thing plop to the ground. Daring to look up, he saw the headless body of Medusa collapsing. The other Gorgons came for him, but Perseus made a dash, dodging over the fallen statues, managing to take the head of Medusa with him.
When the hero was back in his kingdom, Athena paid a visit to him. Perseus handed over the head and the shield back as promised.
After blessing him, she returned to her abode. In the space of her own, she fused the head of her lover with the shield. As she did the task, she knew it would be one of the deadliest weapons. Any ill-intentioned onlooker would be turned to stone through its use. A maiden in trouble could lift the weapon and fight off the attacker easily. Athena went on to keep it safely in the temple where Medusa had reigned for months.
Guilt still weighed heavy in Athena’s chest — no longer did she feel as mighty or as wise.
Yet, Medusa’s hearty afterlife in Elysium — courtesy of Hades — managed to ease some of it. After three attempts of visiting her, Medusa had finally made conversation with her. It had been short, but it was the only thing that had healed some part of Athena.
“Athena,” Medusa had said.
“I am a bridge that mends the torn,A balm where wounds and pain are born.I free the heart, untie the chain,And bring the sun through clouds of rain.
What am I?”
Athena had bowed her head to the spirit, experiencing the bittersweetness of the moment. “Medusa, the woman who opened my eyes and my heart, the answer is forgiveness.”

No other ancient city is as alive for us as Athens at the time of Socrates. Written sources are plentiful, and we do have a lot of Archaeological evidence — especially remarkable are the painted ceramics, showing the inhabitants of Athens in their houses, at the gymnasium, at war and all their other activities. All this allows us to use Plato’s Dialogues as a guide: skipping over the philosophical discussions, together with Socrates, we stroll through the city and enter the houses of its inhabitants.
Socrates reports: ‘At the earliest stages of dawn, Hippocrates came and started beating at my door with his stick; a slave opened the door for him, and he came rushing in and yelled out: Socrates, are you awake or asleep? [Hippocrates brings the news that Protagoras is in town and wants to visit him right away.] ‘Let’s not go there now, my good friend, it’s too early. But let’s go out into the courtyard here and spend the time until sunrise strolling around out…

A walk through history as you tour mill ruins, historic homes, and a battleground at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site.
The site is located about three hours north of St. Louis near the Iowa border.
We first stopped at the former Athens, Mo., General Store. The building is open to the outdoors and now serves as a picnic shelter. Inside you can read signs that describe the history of the store. It was once at the corner of Spring and Thome Street along a path that went down to the ferry that once crossed the Des Moines River.
A nearby sign shows the town at its height from 1853–1860 when it was an important port along the river pre-Civil War.
Next, we saw a monument explaining that the Battle of Athens on Aug. 5, 1861, was the northernmost Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River.
First, a short history lesson to better understand what happened here. Athens prospered until the outbreak of the Civil War. Settled by people from the upper South. Considered by Unionists to be a hotbed of pro-South sentiment. As the spring of 1861 moved into summer, northeast Missourians began choosing sides in the ever-widening national conflict.
Pro-Unionists rallied around David Moore, who had raised a force of about 500 men. Moore entered and occupied Athens on July 24, seizing homes and businesses from pro-South supporters to quarter and provision his troops. Pro-South supporters rallied around Col. Martin Green. Green raised a force of about 3,000 men, including two of Moore’s sons.
The confrontation between Moore’s and Green’s forces took place in Athens on Aug. 5, 1861. The battle began around 5 a.m. Moore and his Unionists were surrounded on three sides by Green’s troops, with the Des Moines River to their rear.
Despite being outnumbered at least five to one, Moore’s men were better trained and equipped.
After about two hours of fighting, at least 50 soldiers had been wounded or killed and the pro-South side was demoralized and in full retreat.
The big loser in the battle was the town of Athens. Bitter feelings between neighbors continued for decades following the Civil War. Athens was also hurt by the shift from the river to railroad transportation in the post-war era. By 1900, the once-thriving town was nearly gone.
(From the Battle of Athens State Historic Site website)
Along a former road, we went by a white picket fence surrounding a foundation. In front, a sign explains what happened after the battle.
A sign in front of the Benning House talks about the forming of Union troops in Northeast Missouri.
We happened to be up at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site when they were conducting tours so the historic homes were open to the public. I would call first to see if they are doing tours before you drive to the site if you want to see the inside of them.
Bedrooms are set up to that period including chamber pots, beds, a chest of drawers, and cabinets along with stoves.
My son pointed out the large piano and a nearby violin.
Fascinating were the intricate details of the patchwork quilt with ducks and even an 1800s girl with schoolbooks.
We then saw the large apple peeler at the end of a cabinet in the kitchen.
The most intriguing aspect of the house is the hole a cannonball left through the kitchen door, through the kitchen, and out the other wall. Although the cannonball harmed no one.
The cannonball fired from the artillery of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard hit the house during the Aug. 5, 1861 battle.
Next, we walked up the road to the Smith Hotel.
Here we found a weaver machine from the 1800s.
A corkboard had photos from the 1800s giving you a sense of the people and houses that were in the town back then.
Andrew checked out the rifles and guns on display.
Next, we walked out to the back where a large cannon is set up on the former battleground. Andrew stood in the back like he was about to fire it.
Then we walked over by the brick Moreland House and Wm. S. French House, abandoned homes in the town.
Next, we went down to the sign for the Mill Trail, which says it is a .3-mile one-way walk. Although, you can do it as a loop since the trail curves back up the hill a short way after passing the mill. This is also shown on the printout of the Mill Trail from the historic site’s website. The total walk is a .4-mile natural surface loop.
Heading down the wide mowed path we pass a ravine that goes into trees.
I spy a white mushroom growing on part of a log.
Below the hill, the trail goes to the left and we saw the brown rock mill remains. These remnants were from a mill constructed by Edward Colton. Built to withstand ice and flooding and stood on a 30-foot stone foundation with an additional four stores and had a water wheel. It was a grist and textile mill until the 1890s.
After checking out the mill we walked a short way along the river before coming to a trail that headed back up the hillside. You could continue along the river, but this is an unlisted trail.
At the top, you can take the White Connector trail to the 2.8-mile natural surface Snow Trillium Trail that goes along the river hills.
We headed back up into the former town to check out the Athens Mill Overlook boardwalk.
This is a good way to see the mill site without having to go down and up the river hill.
Along the boardwalk, you can also see remains of brown rock structures in the woods.
If you like history and ghost towns then this is a worthy trip to make if you are in northeast Missouri. A lot of history in a small area.
A fishing lake, picnic areas, and a playground.
Call 660–877–3871 for more information or to schedule a tour.
Drive: A little over three hour’s drive from the St. Louis Metro. Take Interstate 64 or Interstate 70 to U.S. 61 and go north. North of Wayland, Mo., make a left onto Missouri Highway C then a right onto Missouri Highway 81, and then a right onto Missouri Highway CC that leads to the historic site.
Hours: 7 a.m. — sunset, daily, year-round
Address: State Hwy CC, Revere, MO 63465
A national Civil War battlefield, a frog-shaped rock, and a devil’s elbow are some of what can be seen on the way from St. Louis to Branson!
Dennis Schick Trail includes historic sites and war machinery such as a World War II Sherman Tank in Jefferson Barracks Park in St. Louis County.
If you are heading up to Iowa City from St. Louis another stop is the Swinging Bridge in Columbus Junction, Iowa.
In Columbus Junction, Iowa, you can walk along a swinging bridge that is 262 feet above a dark ravine shrouded in a jungle-like forest.

Athens
Athens, Greece; June 13, 2019
Where to start. It’s so vulnerable to put writing– my ideas materialized for literally anyone to read– out on the internet. Yet, I feel like I need to start blogging. I mean, one day, this will be amazing to read and remember all the details of my life that are so present now. But not only that. I hope you guys (even if the only person reading is my mom) enjoy what you read and take something away from this.
OK. Time to get into what you’re here to read. Greece. Honestly, Greece is a logistical nightmare. Now, don’t get me wrong. Actually being in Greece is incredible. But, the getting there… now that’s a headache. Flying anywhere in Europe is an 8 hour flight or more– that’s a given. But to get to Santorini, it takes a flight from Nashville to New York and then another flight to Athens and then a ferry to the island. That adds up to be almost 24 hours of travel straight. A logistical nightmare. Planning the flights and ferries, doing time change and travel time math… needless to say we were exhausted when we arrived in Athens that first day. We had our ferry to Mykonos booked for the next morning, planning to spend one night in Athens to split up the day of travel. But, when in Athens, you have to visit the Parthenon. So what did we do that day? We visited the Parthenon.
Nashville’s Parthenon had not prepared me for the hike up to and the heat that encompassed the Grecian Parthenon. It was in the upper 90s when we went to the Parthenon, and I was sweating buckets. The Parthenon is on top of this huge peak in Athens, which is amazing in the sense that at the top, you can see a 360* view of the city. But on the other hand, the peak is that much closer to the sun, making walking around on the pavement surrounding the Parthenon feel like you are cooking on a hot grill. The view at the top was insane. Humbling. We could see the entire city below us, seeing the true insignificance of ourselves in the grand scheme of life. Yet, I also felt so important in that moment. The fact that I had traveled so many miles and was lucky enough to experience such an out-of-body moment in the most beautiful country I’d ever been, with the people I loved the most- it was a feeling I can’t find the words to describe.
We made our way down the mountainside (is it a mountain? I don’t really know… maybe a really big hill?) to find ourselves famished. In Europe, the restaurants operate way different from American ones. For one, there are rows and rows of restaurants directly next to each other, all with menus out front and all outdoor seating. Imagine Downtown Franklin, but no indoor seating and all the tables extended into the sidewalk. Also, you have to sit suuuuuper close to the people next to you in Europe when you eat. These are both due to the lack of space and expensive real estate in European cities. See, there are no skyscrapers in Europe; the restaurants are in original buildings. So, when searching for a restaurant, you can see the entire thing from the street and you kind of know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.
We walked down street upon street of crowded restaurants, searching for one that could accommodate the 5 of us and seemed to serve ~gluten free and vegan~ food. We finally found this one, which was literally the first one we saw and somehow skipped. This restaurant was at the foot of the Parthenon, with an incredible view of the Acropolis from below. (It’s called Athina Bistrot, if any of you are ever in Athens and need an amazing restaurant!) We were seated among locals, all of whom were enjoying casual coffee and business meetings amidst our day of tourism.
Another thing about Europe: they don’t serve you water. Ok, that’s dramatic. They do serve you water. But not in the way American restaurants do. Let’s take dinner at Cheesecake Factory for example. You sit and the waiter brings you a glass of water initially, refills when they bring you bread, refills when getting your food order, and again fills your glass when the food comes. And that’s not even including dessert. But in Europe, you have to ask for water and for refills. And the water comes from a glass bottle they leave at your table to refill. And here’s the catch: they charge you for each bottle. So, it is likely that one is dehydrated the majority of the time they are abroad. That being said, my family finished six. Let me repeat. Six bottles of water. Before we had even been served. We were parched–to say the least. Our waiter and the others dining in the restaurant found us comical- the group of 5 American tourists guzzling down upwards of $30 in water.
Our waiter. The reason I am writing this today. Actually, he and I are friends on Facebook so he may see this. So, if you’re reading this, Nikitas– hey! Nikitas was quite the conversationalist. His English was really good, so we were able to chat with him whilst inhaling our Greek salads. Every so often, I would look over into the kitchen to see Nikitas looking fondly at my family.
Every few minutes, Nikitas would come over to our table to check on us and start up a conversation about everything– to life in America and what we had planned for our trip. Here’s another thing about Europe that’s important to know here: they don’t give you the check. Again, I’m being dramatic. They do give you the check. But, in America, the minute you finish eating your food, they give you the check. This table turnover is the way American restaurants operate. The sooner they get you in and out, the more tables they can seat and the more tips they can make. But in Europe, they don’t give you the check immediately, you have to ask for it. European culture centers around eating and community, so the waitstaff don’t rush you out. Secondly, the restaurants in Europe stay open until the early morning hours, so there is not really a rush from the waiters to kick each table out. That being said, we sat at that table for hours sipping on our bottled waters and chatting with Nikitas.
Towards the end of our meal, Nikitas came by again. This time, he told us about his life. He was a single father raising his son, a son he saw as his world. He told us about the countless hours he worked just to make sure his son was well cared for. When Nikitas talked about his son, his eyes sparkled and he beamed. He opened up about how he envied the closeness of our family and how he loved seeing us together, happy.
That one hit home. I realized the true value of the moment I was living. I had all of my family together, at one table, in the most beautiful country, and here’s the kicker. We were happy. I began to think about how this moment was fleeting. Some day I would look back on this moment with such nostalgia, such joy. I felt a twinge of sadness, I knew I would miss this moment and I was currently living in it. Nostalgia for the present is such a powerful thing. I missed this moment before it was even over.
This idea taught me to hold on much tighter to what I experience that is good. I now feel as though I collect moments and memories, rather than let them pass idly by. I have grown to miss moments whilst living them, knowing the exact laughs and conversations are irreplaceable. And after my whole life, not stopping to realize the impermanence memories, it took Nikitas, a waiter in Athens to teach me. I took that lesson and ran. I lived that trip with the intention to remember and cherish every moment.
We left Athens the next morning and embarked on two weeks of Grecian life in Mykonos and Santorini. And trust me, the stories I have about the rest of the trip will be told in their entirety on future blog posts… Get excited ;)
Back to logistics. A ferry back to Athens was the first leg of the trip back home to Nashville. Again, we stayed in Athens for a night before we took a flight to New York and then another one to Nashville. When we arrived in Athens, I knew there was one thing I wanted to do. Eat at that restaurant.
My family and I made our way back to the restaurant he worked at– hoping he would be our waiter again. He was there. A reminder of the fleeting nature of the present and the necessity of cherishing every moment.

Athens is an iconic city with a huge history. I’ve always dreamed of going there and this article will help you enjoy this.
Also, remember that I’m also writing on Medium and that it is very important for me growing a huge community over here so please go and follow my channel with this link : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Athens, the capital of Greece, is a dynamic metropolis in southeastern Europe. With an area of around 39 km², it is relatively small compared to other European capitals, but its cultural and historical wealth makes it a place of exceptional importance.
In 2021, Athens had a population of around 664,046, making it Greece’s most populous city. It is the country’s political, economic and cultural center. The city is famous for its emblematic ancient monuments, including the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the ancient Agora, which bear witness to its rich historical heritage.
Athens is divided into several districts, but has no official arrondissements like some other metropolises. The city has a complex administrative organization, with subdivisions such as districts, municipalities and suburbs.
Geopolitically, Athens is of strategic importance due to its geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea. It plays a central role in Greece’s politics and economy, as well as in the region’s international relations. The city is home to numerous government institutions, embassies and international organizations.
In addition to its historical heritage, Athens is also renowned for its Mediterranean cuisine, lively neighborhoods, colorful markets and vibrant nightlife. Visitors can explore its museums, theaters and art galleries, as well as enjoy the breathtaking views from the Acropolis hill.
Athens, with its fascinating blend of past and present, is a must for travelers seeking history, culture and the excitement of a major European city.
Athens has a rich history stretching back thousands of years, with roots deeply rooted in Greek mythology. Here’s a summary of key moments in the city’s history from its legendary beginnings.
Athens takes its name from the Greek goddess Athena, who is said to have won a contest with Poseidon to become the city’s protector. According to legend, she gave the city an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity, and thus Athens was born.
The first traces of human occupation in Athens date back to the Bronze Age, around 3000 BC. At that time, it was a small farming community.
Athens developed during the Archaic period (800–500 BC), becoming a powerful city-state with a system of government based on nascent democracy.
The 5th century BC is often referred to as Athens’ Golden Age. Under the leadership of Pericles, the city flourished culturally, politically and economically. It was during this period that monuments such as the Parthenon were built.
Athens played a crucial role in the Median Wars (490–479 BC), repelling the Persian invasion and consolidating its position in Greece.
Athens was embroiled in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), a devastating conflict with its rival Sparta. This war weakened Athenian power.
In 338 BC, Athens fell under the domination of Philip II of Macedon, then his son, Alexander the Great.
After the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens lost some of its political importance, but became a cultural center of the Roman Empire.
Under the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, Athens continued to be a prosperous city, although it suffered barbarian invasions and unrest over the centuries.
From the 15th century onwards, Athens fell under Ottoman domination, a period that lasted until the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century.
The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) led to the liberation of Athens and the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830.
Contemporary times: Since independence, Athens has become the capital of Greece, playing a key role in the country’s political, cultural and economic development. It hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has continued to thrive as a cultural and intellectual center.
Today, Athens remains a crossroads of history and culture, bearing witness to its long and fascinating history from its modest mythological beginnings to its status as a dynamic, modern metropolis.
Athens is packed with historic, cultural and picturesque sites to discover as a tourist. Here are ten must-see places to visit when you’re in Athens:
This is Athens’ most emblematic site, home to the majestic Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Theater of Dionysus. The Acropolis offers a panoramic view of the city.
This historic site is home to ancient temples, stelae and monuments. It was the heart of public life in Athens in ancient times.
This world-renowned museum displays an impressive collection of artifacts and sculptures from the Acropolis, providing a valuable backdrop to a visit to the site itself.
Watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony in front of the Parliament building on Syntagma Square. The building itself is a magnificent example of neoclassical architecture.
Explore the winding, picturesque streets of Plaka, one of Athens’ most charming districts, with its boutiques, tavernas and colorful houses.
This museum houses a vast collection of ancient artifacts, including sculptures, jewelry and archaeological treasures, offering a comprehensive overview of Greek history.
Climb to the top of this hill for breathtaking panoramic views of Athens, especially at sunset.
Visit this lively district for its flea market, cafés, vintage stores and the famous Monastiraki square.
Discover this ancient marble stadium, which was restored to host the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
If you have time, take a trip outside Athens to admire the temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, located on the seafront and offering spectacular views of the Aegean Sea.
These sites offer a comprehensive overview of the history, culture and beauty of Athens, giving you an unforgettable experience in this fascinating city.
A world-renowned Greek philosopher, Plato was the founder of the Academy of Athens, one of the world’s first institutions of higher learning. His philosophical dialogues, notably “The Republic”, have influenced Western thought for centuries.
A pupil of Plato, Aristotle was another renowned philosopher from Athens. His contributions to philosophy, biology, politics and metaphysics had a lasting impact on many disciplines.
Athenian historian, Thucydides is the author of “The Peloponnesian War”, a detailed account of the war between Athens and Sparta. His work is considered a masterpiece of history and politics.
An influential Greek politician, Venizelos was Prime Minister of Greece four times in the early 20th century. He played a major role in the reforms and political events of his era, including the Balkan Wars and the First World War.
Actress and politician, Melina Mercouri was a passionate cultural ambassador for Greece. She won the Prix d’interprétation féminine at the Cannes Film Festival in 1960 for her role in “Jamais le dimanche” and served as Greece’s Minister of Culture, fighting for the restitution of the Parthenon marbles.
These Athens personalities have left a lasting imprint in fields ranging from philosophy to politics to cinema, helping to shape the history and culture of Greece and the world.

In early 2019 I took a leap of faith and moved to Los Angeles to pursue my own, American dream. There, while working two jobs to make ends meet, I made a painful realisation: the industry that I had been born into, the industry of hospitality, is not the one that makes my heart skip a beat.
While still in the city of angels, I stumbled upon jetdrops’ job opening and I sent my CV. A couple of Skype interviews and a transatlantic flight later, here I am, sitting on my desk with my fancy new title: Communications Specialist & PR Executive.
Some people might say I kicked “an opportunity of a lifetime” by coming back to Athens, Greece. I returned extremely driven and determined to get out of my comfort zone and pursue my desire: a career in the communication field. It is a personal challenge, an investment on my own self and I am ready to face all the consequences with unapologetic confidence.
I still remember how nervous I was while preparing for my first day. I wanted to look professional and considered as an equal team member from my colleagues. My black work pants, a casual white shirt and my blue loafers were my best allies. Soon after arriving in the office, I realised my outfit plays a minimal role and everyone here speaks through their work.
After a typical “first day in the office”, where I met the rest of the team and got a brief introduction to my duties, I recall my bizarre feelings while walking home: it probably was a mixture of utter excitement and… panic; a mixture that even today, cannot fully decode & understand.
This was not your typical 9–5 job, full of judgemental supervisors or surrounded by people who hate their jobs. jetdrops is an environment of regulated individual autonomy that operates with a common purpose: build projects that make the team proud and the client happy. And if not anything else, I had come to respect their commitment and work of ethic. Thus I could not help but feel intimidated since I had yet, nothing to offer to the table.
Despite the fact that I have very little experience working in an advertising & communications agency, terms like “press release”, “media kit” and “brand awareness” were not foreign to me. However, understanding their practical meaning has in fact proven to be extremely crucial.
My manager and mentor, Dora Papakonstantopoulou, has been a catalyst that will determine my future in this field. My learning process has been expedited; reporting, research, project management and aligning with internal and external stakeholders have been in my place since day one. Before my second week came to an end, I had already organised and facilitated the internal process of an upcoming campaign’s brainstorming.
Having such an overall sense of responsibility is the kind of position I have been dreaming for and, despite my limited experience, I am determined to validate my efforts. My choice of leaving la-la land was a risk that was meant to be taken and I fully agree with Jim Rohn:
If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.

Clear your calendar on May 22, 2023, and prepare yourself for the trial of the millennium. And it’s not the one you’re thinking of. This particular event has been in the making for about two thousand years.
The one and only Socrates has received a second day in court, in front of The National Hellenic Museum (NHM) in Chicago of all places
Honestly, I’d convict him again, but my opinion isn’t popular.
The gut reaction for most is an easy win for the defense. After all, Socrates is likely one of the most beloved figures in the history of philosophy. As law student and history scholar Theodoros Karasavvas at Ancient Origins points out:
“His death was a dark moment in Athenian and human history, but his thinking and teachings have survived as a beacon of light for almost 2,500 years.”
Karasavvas also reminds us “for all his greatness and popular acclaim, Socrates had fanatic enemies as well,” mainly for his “powers of persuasion” and “opposition to authority.”
Like many have stated before, he calls the original case “one of the saddest cases of a miscarriage of justice…

A literary translation of my thoughts on cities, public spaces, urbanism etcetera.

This one came to me as a volunteer assignment from Laneway Project, a nonprofit organisation in Toronto that works to convert laneways to vibrant public spaces. As researcher and writer, I was asked to study best practices in laneway projects across the world and write about any one of them. Since another volunteer had already researched examples from the US & Australia, I was left to get more creative and research about lesser known examples from the non-English-speaking world.
There were four projects that were interesting to study — the Dashilar project in Beijing that revived a traditional urban hutong in the city; the revival of Gaengeviertel in Hamburg by artists and citizens to prevent its demolition; a project called BioUrban in Sao Paulo led by a sociologist who lived and worked in a favela to develop a sense of stewardship among the favela dwellers and lastly, Atenistas — a citizen group in Athens that is run exclusively by volunteers to regenerate dead spaces in Athens and make people fall in love (again) with Athens.
Tough as it may be, I had to choose one of these projects to write on. I think what really pulled me towards Atenistas was the community spirit and love for the city they seemed to be injecting into Athens and its people. And so, I began to write about them. To read the article, click here.

A week ago, we drove 30 kilometers to Athens. We had to do a hospital check-up, which turned out to finish quickly.
It was broad daylight in Athens at that time, and we didn’t feel like driving back 30 kilometers to home immediately. So, we decided to do something in the city. We had plenty of time until dusk.
There were several Asian restaurants in Athens with cuisine that I wanted to taste. Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, and Indonesian foods were among the options I was curious about. To kill time, we therefore opted to have lunch at an Asian restaurant.
After comparing the opening hours of several restaurants, we finally picked an Indonesian restaurant. It was the only one ready to accept hungry visitors. Other restaurants would open later, in the afternoon or evening.
Without further ado, we drove off to Agios Nikolaos.
The Indonesian restaurant that we were about to visit was Lombok Red Chili—lombok means ‘chili’ in Indonesian.

After my emotional post talking about seeing the Acropolis and Parthenon from afar I thought I would now share our experience of seeing it all up close and personal.
We decided to go and visit the site on our third day in Athens and set off nice and early to make sure we had a full day to take it all in.
We walked through the city feeling excited and with the boys chatting a lot about what they were expecting to see. I understand why people use taxis and other public transport to get around cities but if you are physically able I really recommend walking. As you approach the main entrance to the hill you come through a village within the city called Plaka. It’s one of the oldest parts of the city and is full of quaint winding roads filled with cafés, restaurants, tourist shops and jewellery stores. You’ll pay more for food and goods here as they are hoping to entice the excited overseas visitors but if you go just for the atmosphere and hold back from getting the credit card out it’s really charming.
We made our way through the maze of small streets and approached the top of the hill. Before you get to the main entrance, over to your right you will see a rocky outpost jutting up in front of you. This is called Areopagus Hill (or Mars Hill) and if you like your Christian history this is the hill where the Apostle Paul delivered his famous “sermon in the mount”.
There are some steps up to the top and it’s really worth taking 5 minutes to head up and take in the views. You can see Plaka beneath you stretching out to the city beyond and behind you is the Parthenon, sitting grandly at the top of the hill. This is where you get your first full view of the size and magnificence of the place.
After we’d had our fill of this view we made our way over to the ticket office. We’d read that in the summer it can get really busy but on this warm December day just before Christmas it was fairly quiet and we didn’t have to queue at all. There were quite a few tour guides eager for us to use their services but we’d decided to go at our own pace and so politely, but increasingly firmly, said no thank you.
In the winter season you pay €10 for adult tickets with children getting in for free (the adult price is doubled through the summer). Your ticket gives you access to the whole site which is massive so well worth the money we thought.
We entered through the ticket barriers and tried to get our bearings a little. There’s a hill straight in front of you that takes you up to the Parthenon itself and then pathways leading away to your left and right, we took the right hand path and started to wander along.
One of the first things we saw was The Odeon of Herodes Atticus. This is a fairly “modern” part of the site because although the original theatre was built in 161 CE, over the years it was left to ruin before being rebuilt in the 1950’s and it is still used for drama and musical productions throughout the year. The seating area is solid marble and really impressive. You can also see this structure from the road behind the Parthenon site and it’s worth taking a wander at some point while in Athens to see both angles.
Carrying on past the Odeon there are collections of pillars, engraved stones and other treasures that have been excavated from the site over time. A very serious security guard is on hand to be sure no one is touching but you can go right up the stones, getting really close and trying to make out the faded drawings and writing which we thought was great.
A little further along is the Theatre of Dionysus. Much older than it’s Odeon counterpart and would have been used to showcase the first Greek tragedies in the 6th Century BCE. Dionysus was god of many things including wine making, festivity and theatre and we thought he sounded a fun god to have around.
We then wandered around the rest of the gardens on that side of the hill, you can see more artifacts dotted about and there are plenty of information signs in both Greek and English that fill in any of the gaps in knowledge that you might have. On the south side of the hill, high up from ground level is the entrance to The Forgotten Monument of Thrysallus. An ancient entrance to a temple that is now sadly too damaged to enter safely. The doorway, with it’s white columns, stark against the surrounding rock looks really enticing and I hope that they are able to restore and reopen this impressive monument one day.
Having seen all there was to see at ground level we now began to make our way up the uneven paths towards the Parthenon itself.
If you are ever here you must make sure you enter through the Propylaea, this is the original entrance where Athenians through the ages would have entered to seek knowledge or help or to pray and it’s really a grand sight. We took some time to sit on the steps, drinking in the atmosphere. It was a little busy but not overwhelming and everyone was mindful and respected other’s personal space. Other than signs asking you to please not touch the marble, it’s all open and again you can get really close to the pillars and stonework that make up the walk way to the top of the Acropolis.
Once at the top of the stairs the floor levels off, there is always work being done on the site and they have apparently spent a long time in recent years improving access. So although the pathways around the temples are rocky and uneven there is a smooth path right through the middle making it much more accessible to those with mobility issues.
There is so much to see once at the top, the highlight of course being the Parthenon itself, the largest structure and centrepiece of the site (this is the one you see on posters, postcards and websites — the one you can see from all around the city). Plenty of scaffolding around the temple does not detract from it’s size and grandeur. Take some time to study the pillars, looking at the hand carved detail is astonishing. We did at least two laps of the building before moving on.
My favourite thing to see was the temple of Athena — with it’s reproduction statues of the goddess around the front (you can see the originals in the Acropolis museum), it’s really a site worth seeing. If you can manage some steps and uneven ground go around the back to see the enormous entrance door to get a perspective of what it would have been like for members of the public coming to pray and offer gifts to the goddess.
The last thing I’ll point out as a “must do” up here is to go to the far end of the site and up a few steps to the Acropolis View point. This looks back over the Parthenon and other temples giving you a wonderful vantage point (and if you are feeling brave you can also peer over the top at the sheer drop down the side of the Acropolis back to street level! Warning this is not an activity for those, like my dear husband, who are worried about heights).
There are of course many other sites to see, smaller temples like Athena Nike (which was painstakingly taken apart, renovated and then put back together again in the late 1990's), as well as other areas of restoration. If you go with children see if they can spot the metal tracks that circle the site which are used to move the huge stones and marble structures as work is carried out.
After we had had our fill of Greek history we slowly made our way back down through the grand entrance and back down the hill. It takes some time, partly because it’s all quite uneven and a little slippery but partly because you just can’t stop looking at the architecture and small treasures to be found around each new corner.
We left the site through the smaller entrance on the South side, along the pedestrianised walkway of Dionysiou Areopagitou. I understand that this entrance is mostly used for tour groups and school visits but in the summer can be less busy than the main entrance for individuals needing to buy tickets.
The entrance to the Acropolis Museum is also along this walkway, we did the museum visit on a different day but if you are only in Athens for a short time it would definitely make sense to do both in the same day as they are so close. I would really recommend seeing the Acropolis first as it was fabulous to see the friezes, statues and pillars in the museum and be able to picture where you would have seen them up on the hill.
Like so many people seeing the Parthenon and spending time on the Acropolis was one of the big reasons for our visit to this city and it did not disappoint. Here are some final tips that I think would make your visit go smoothly:
* Wear good comfy, study shoes. They are making big improvements to accessibility on the site but there are lots of uneven pathways, steps and slippery surfaces so open toed sandals would not be a great choice of footwear.
* Bring plenty of water. It was a warm day when we went and with the amount of walking we did we needed plenty of hydration, I imagine it can get quite uncomfortable in the summer months.
* Read up about some the Greek gods before you go, in particular Athena, Psoiedon, Zeus and Dionysus. It was really great to bring those names to life as we saw the temples and read the information signs.
* If you are going to visit more than one or two archaeological sites you can buy combination tickets which can end up saving you money.
*Decide beforehand if you would like to use a guide while you are there so you can be confident in saying yes or no to the people who approach you at the ticket entrances.
Comment below if you’ve found this useful or if you’ve been yourself and would add any other tips :-)

It’s currently day 5, and I should say first off that it’s pretty hard to get started on writing right now. That’s not because I’m exhausted from all the cycling and heat and general intensity (although I very much am). Rather, it’s the opposite. It’s because I’m laid back in the perfect deckchair, reclined at the perfect angle, looking out at the perfect view from my perfect rest-day holiday home which I snagged for the perfect — and perfectly ridiculous — price of £33 a night.
But it hasn’t all been this sweet. Far from it.
Let’s rewind a bit.
Athens was good to me, all things considered. This is a blog about bike touring so I won’t go into too much detail regarding my holiday affairs, but a few choice notes before we continue:
Verdict: I thoroughly recommend Athens as a city to visit. Don’t hesitate if you get the chance.
Anyway, let’s get this bike tour started!
I’d been waiting for the bike tour anxiety to arrive for months, and it was only on the morning of leaving that it hit me. But I don’t think it was the tour as a whole I was afraid of; it was simply getting out of Athens. I’ve been to cities with worse traffic, but I’ve also been to cities with much better.
I tried to make the most of the €4 all-you-can-eat breakfast, shovelling spoonfuls of oats into my mouth, but the nerves weren’t allowing my stomach to settle. I did my best to force it all down, figuring that I’d just throw some of it up if need be. My body would work it out.
I’d reassembled my bike the previous day and had all my bags packed, so I’m not quite sure how it took me a further hour to get going, but that’s what happened. Eventually I was ready, and, after some rejigging of the panniers (does one ever just jig?), I was on my wobbly wobbly way out of the hostel and into the streets of Athens. I had begun!
And then, not 10 seconds later, I stopped. Brake calibration issues would in fact plague me for the next hour or so, but eventually I got those suckers under control and started to build some momentum. As for the streets of Athens, they were remarkably easy to navigate (Komoot certainly helped). There were plenty of bike lanes, pink and quiet and well-paved, and within just a few minutes of finding them all my fears of getting squashed by a passing fruit cart were put to rest.
The bike lanes eventually ended and I had no choice but to take to the roads, but these weren’t too much trouble. There was one hill which to this day remains the steepest hill I’ve climbed — we’re talking cheese-rolling levels here — but after I’d tidied my lungs back into my chest, the rest of Athens was plain sailing.
Talking of sailing, next up was the Port of Piraeus, where I’d been told I could board a ferry to Salamina, a necessary stepping stone on the way out of Greece. I asked around and was told a boat would come ‘soon’. Four people gave me the same answer. I waited for the boat. And waited. And waited. Was ‘soon’ actually the Greek word for ‘you’re in the wrong place, my friend’?
It might well have been. Eventually, the fifth person I asked told me that I was indeed at the wrong port and that I’d need to get to Perama. Alrighty then. Another 10km of riding, this stretch significantly less enjoyable as I shared main roads with speeding cars, and I was finally at the right port just as the ferry was about to leave. I rolled the bike onto the ferry and gave myself a pat on the back for making it through the streets of Athens.
Riding in Salamina was great, my first experience of the treats to come. An appetiser, if you will. Lightly undulating hills carried me past glittering waters under a clear blue sky, and there was a pretty horse somewhere too. It wasn’t long before I had to stop for my first photoshoot — the first of many, I’m not ashamed to say.
After an hour or so, I reached the next ferry that would take me back to the mainland. Rolling my bike onto the ferry, a man in overalls began yelling at me:
‘Look at the cones, look at the cones, what do they mean!?’
Smiling dumbly, I told him I didn’t know what the cones meant, but, goodness me, there’s a strong smell of paint in here, isn’t there?
It turned out I had rolled my bike straight over his freshly painted deck. Whoopsie. The paint wasn’t wet enough to cling to my tyres — a shame, cornflower blue wheels would have been quite fetching — but he gave me an earful nonetheless. I made my silly-tourist apologies and parked up my bike, breathing in the good if slightly painty sea air as we made the crossing.
Back on the mainland, I experienced some hillier sections for the next hour or so. My legs hadn’t yet adjusted to the work required and I found this pretty tough going. However, it was made much easier by the scenery I was passing through: looming dusty-orange cliff faces to the right, sparkling ocean to the left. And also by the driver who gave me the rocker sign as he passed me in his van. Thank you, stranger.
Away from the coast, I had my first encounter with aggressive dogs. This was to become a frequent occurrence. You hear the barks first of all, not quite sure which direction they’re coming from, and then suddenly there’s a four-legged creature all slobber and fury rushing towards you. I’ve become a little more used to it by now, but it still jars, and the first time was a pretty hairy experience.
At one point, the dogs wouldn’t stop chasing me and I was worried about them getting caught in the wheels, so I stopped, put the bike between myself and the dogs, and in my best angry-dad voice, commanded ‘STOP, BAD DOG, GO HOME’. And did they listen? Reader, they did not. They just snarled and barked and bared their impressive canines.
But, next time, I’d be ready for them. Oh, I’d be ready for them. I’d slipped my ultrasonic dog repeller into my pocket for easy access and, at the first sound of barking, I wielded my wand like Ron Weasley at a pack of fluffy dementors.
Be gone, vile beasts! I might or might not have yelled.
And, astonishingly, it worked! At least kind of. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting anything at all from this unassuming bit of plastic, and it’s true that the device didn’t stop them from chasing me all together. But once I clicked that magic button, they seemed to fall back to a safer distance. And oh, the power I felt… This Ron might just become his own Voldemort.
As the day was drawing to a close and my energy reserves were being depleted, I stopped off for the perfect refuel: a pita filled with chips and gyros. This I shared with a much nicer chap than the ones who had come before. Maybe it was the food, but this dog was just an absolute pal. Perhaps I should be wielding chicken gyros at my attackers rather than a plastic stick in future.
I finally reached my campsite in Ancient Corinth at around 7.30pm. I didn’t want to wild camp, deciding that it would be best for the first night to be somewhere I felt safe and could get a decent night’s rest.
The former worked out well; the latter, not so much. Dogs barked from all sides deep into the night and, as I had left my earplugs in my panniers and was tucked up (un)comfortably in my tent, I couldn’t bring myself to go outside and get them. Eventually, at around 1.30am and with the chorus of howls still in full swing, I succumbed and dragged myself out of the tent.
It was a smart move. There is a singular pleasure to wandering out of your tent in the dead of night — the stars, the moon, the exquisite isolation. As I stood there craning my neck up at the sky, feeling impossibly small and yet entirely undiminished, I felt a deep sense of good will from the universe. The trip had begun, and everything was going to be okay.
Distance covered: 94km / Elevation gained: 740m

Welcome to Athens, Mississippi. Athens is an unincorporated community just a few minutes outside of the small town that I reside in. But, somehow, I had never explored it.
I assembled a dream team of myself, Davis Helton, and Luke Johnson (Davis would kill me if he didn’t have a shout-out), and we decided to delve deep into this lost community to visit the long-fabled Athens Jail.
Built in 1830, the jail is somewhat mysterious, with stories of ghosts running abound in my community. According to the fine folks at the Monroe County Historical Society (this society is truly top notch, keeping records and finding stories of a small community with little publicity), Joshua Toomer created the current structure of the jail in 1845. Later that night, Toomer drunkenly hopped on the wrong horse and was accused of being a horse thief. This accusation landed him the luxury of being the first person to stay a night in this newly founded jail.
It is no surprise that ghostly rumors would be abundant for a building of this nature. This is where things get a little murky, as the jail kept no records as to who exactly died there and how.

Kelly May Sheehan — UX Researcher, Designer, and Developer
Zoë Phalen — UX Researcher, Designer, and Developer
During my Emerging Media Master’s program, I developed a capstone project in place of a thesis. I partnered with my peer, Zoë Phalen, to create Athens Era.
The final task on the capstone journey requires individuals and teams to present their project at the event, Emerge. This event invites students, faculty, alumni, and guests to celebrate the completion of the degree and each capstone project. Each team takes the spotlight and provides an overview of their completed work.
I created an e-ccomerce marketplace website for local artists of Athens, GA along with my partner for our capstone project, called Athens Era. I worked on developing the website, while producing supporting materials. All materials and deliverables may be accessed on our project website, here.
We developed our capstone project in separate stages, and documented our progress with youtube videos. Our full capstone journey can be viewed on our youtube playlist, here.
At the beginning of this course, we already produced our capstone website in its alpha stage. We started with developing our website in its beta stage, with guidance from the results of our user research and testing.
We had identified the website’s issues, but finding the solution for each was our challenge.
With each stage of development, we focused on separate issues we identified during our research:
One of our biggest leaps in development, was when we created additional graphics to match our brand and help tell the story of what Athens Era is. They really helped show how Athens Era is a credible platform for artists and assisting in storytelling throughout the website. Here are a few graphics:
Beyond the development of our capstone website, we created a poster to promote our final project. With this poster, we aimed to clearly communicate what Athens Era is and attract people to the website. This would help solve the issue of: “weak recognition of website for only Athens, GA artists” before people first visit the website.
Of course, we also addressed the weak recognition of the website for only Athens artists by changing our information architecture and wording for more clarity.
Along with the poster, we also created a trailer for the promotion of Athens Era. We began with a storyboard of our original idea for the production of the trailer.
Later, we iterated our storyboard to reflect our final trailer, which may be viewed here.
We used Canva to produce our trailer after trying out different videos platforms. Due to our lack of video production equipment, we opted to use Canva for its digital animations and resources for a fully digitally designed trailer, as opposed to using raw footage we could have filmed form our phones.
After we uploaded all of our deliverables to our project website and concluded our development on Athens Era, we presented our results at the New Media Institute’s end of year event, Emerge.
Our Emerge presentation summarizes our capstone journey and demos our functioning website and its notable features.
We spoke about the inspiration of the project, along with our ideation methods, research, and development.
The Athens Era Emerge Presentation may be viewed here.
Throughout this course, I learned how to effectively communicate with an audience through digital and physical products. I am pleased with the completion of our capstone project and how much I have developed my storytelling skills.

Outbound adventures: 10 mouth-watering dishes you should try next time you visit Athens,https://medium.com/@noureldin_z3r0/outbound-adventures-10-mouth-watering-dishes-you-should-try-next-time-you-visit-athens-e89b83e5050b,"Sign up

Greece is one of the oldest, most authentic, and most delicious countries you can ever visit.
Besides its magnificent culture and history, Greek cuisine is something you need to try!
A lot of the Greek delights are similar to the food we are used to having here in Egypt, but with an exquisite twist!
Meat is vital in Greek cuisine. You have three dishes that you may think are the same: Souvlaki, Gyro, and Kebap.
Souvlaki means skewer, so it’s basically anything grilled on a skewer; could be meat, chicken, or lamb, usually served on a dish, but sometimes also gyro-style. Yummy!
Eating at Thanasis, a very famous local souvlaki place.(Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is the most traditional 2-euro food in Greece.
Meat is grilled vertically and then sliced (like shawarma), rolled in the delicious Greek “pita” bread, and sauced with the most famous Greek sauce: tzatziki (you may think you have tried it in Egypt, but trust me, it is not the same).
Fun fact: almost every gyro place in Athens has Egyptian workers!

This is the last of the meat trio. It looks like “kofta,” but much more delicious, with a different set of spices. It is also larger in size and more fatty and is usually served gyro-style. This is also cheap, 2 euro food.
4- Mousaka
This is like pasta-free lasagne, made up of eggplants, zucchini, minced meat, and potatoes, topped with onions and tomatoes and covered in bechamel and sometimes grilled cheese. It is a traditional delicious dish you must try.
Eating Spinakotapa for breakfast. I can do that every day. (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is a personal favorite. I hardly love spinach, but this spinach pie has changed what I think about vegetables!
It is a pastry pie filled with green sautéed spinach, sometimes with grilled cheese or feta cheese, available in different shapes and sizes. Personally, I can have this for breakfast every single day!
No Greek food list should miss tzatziki! This sauce is the most common appetizer and the most delicious dipping for almost anything. Whether you are eating chips, eggplant, or meat, tzatziki works as a perfect dip. Or you can just eat it with a pita!
Deep-fried feta cheese! Here in Egypt, we are used to having “Roumi” cheese fried, but feta? You should try this!
Simply zucchini balls. I’m not a big fan of zucchini at all, but Greece taught me that I am wrong! Almost any food that contains zucchini here is utterly delicious. I even had zucchini pizza!
Try this one and change how you feel about zucchini forever.
Zucchini balls and Saganaki, are delicious Greek specialties. (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Some of you might be familiar with this. It is an old recipe that my grandpa used to make for us but is rarely found anywhere now. It is a very simple recipe of oil, sugar, semolina flour, and water.
It is like a greenish pudding with a truly mesmerizing sweet taste. You should give it a try.
Although it looks exactly like your regular “konafa,” I promise you, it’s not the same!
Kanataifi is more creamy, frothy, and sweet. It literally melts in your mouth. You should have one!
Chilling in my favorite Athens neighborhood, the Plaka (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
These are just some of the Greek delights! The list is longer than we can fit in one article. There is Loukoumades, Galaktoboureko, Fava, Baklava, Taramosalata, and your good old Greek salad too!
You will gain a couple of kilograms in Athens, that’s for sure.

A blog looking at modern performance, adaptation and appropriation of Shakespeare on stage, screen and beyond. #RethinkingShax

Last week I attended the NT Live broadcast of Nicholas Hytner’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at The Bridge Theatre and it is an experience which I will never forget. Just as Peter Brook’s seminal RSC production struck a chord in the 1970s with its minimalist staging and darker, adult take on Shakespeare’s comedy, so I expect director Hytner’s immersive, pop culture savvy production to become one which defines future Dreams for decades to come.
Despite the largely carnivalesque tenor of this production (which felt as palpable in the cinema as in the theatre), the production opened on an unexpectedly sombre note. A procession of black clad men and women entered the stage singing in plain chant, thus conjuring a funereal mood as opposed the ‘nuptial hour’ promised in Theseus’s (Oliver Chris) opening line.
The costumes of the female characters, the audience had been told in the opening commentary before the production began, were supposedly evocative of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, which has found renewed cultural currency in recent years due to a successful television adaptation and its resonance with contemporary feminist movements such as #MeToo.
This was underlined by the production’s first (of many) spectacular effects as Hippolyta (Gwendoline Christie) was transported onstage, trapped inside a sleek glass cage which reminded the audience of her status as a captive queen, a fact over which so many productions choose to elide. Gemma wrote about this aspect of the production in detail in her article earlier this week, offering a deeper dive into that image and its connections to Christie’s role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones.
Not only is Hippolyta a prisoner to a conquering duke but Hermia (Isis Hainsworth) is also greatly mistreated in this opening scene as it is assumed that she is the property of both her father and intended husband, despite her protestations that she wishes to marry another man of her choosing. The decision to draw out these more insidious themes from one of Shakespeare’s most beloved comedies by connecting them to memorable feminist imagery in popular culture was therefore highly astute.
One of the key feature’s of this production were the modern linguistic additions to Shakespeare’s text which, although initially jarring in the serious opening scenes at court, felt incredibly natural once delivered by the Rude Mechanicals in their first appearance onstage. The Bridge Theatre’s immersive pit also allowed actors to use the audience in inventive and involving ways, such as when the Mechanicals wish to consult a ‘calendar’ in Act 3 Scene 1 to know whether the moon will shine during their performance.
Given the ‘extra-textual’ additions to Shakespeare’s text already established early on in the production, it therefore made perfect sense for the cast to break out into the audience and decide to consult the Calendar app in an audience member’s phone. This not only updated the scene to incorporate the changing sense of what the word ‘calendar’ means but gave way to hilarious unspoken remonstrations when the Mechanicals became side-tracked by looking through said phone at images which we can only assume were illicit. The extract from the broadcast below features this moment in all its glory.
Hammed Animashaun’s extraordinary Bottom shone particularly brightly during these anachronistic moments. His naturalistic delivery and a wide comedic range encompassed everything from deadpan moments able to draw laughs by the merest eyebrow raise to the best version of Pyramus’s ludicrously overlong and overblown suicide which I’ve ever witnessed.
However, it would be remiss not to mention Felicity Montagu’s understated Quince, who provided the perfect foil for her shrieking, scene-stealing counterpart. There was a perfectly acute balance between tension and affection at the heart of their relationship. Despite Bottom’s leading thespian/backseat director pushing against the rules imposed by Quince’s put-upon actor-manager, it was nevertheless clear that they were pulling in the same direction and this ensured that those scenes were some of the production’s best.
In a further attempt to redress the gender imbalance and biases of Shakespeare’s play, Hytner chose to swap many of the lines delivered by Oberon (Oliver) and Titania (Christie). It is this decision, perhaps, that served the production most effectively. Now with the lion’s share of the lines, Christie was a truly powerful Titania, displaying brilliant armography (thanks Strictly) and radiating majestical power which will be familiar to anyone who has seen her steal each Game of Thrones scene in which she features.
The reversal of Fairy King and Queen was particularly effective in the inclusion of a subtle twist at the play’s end that — thanks to Oliver and Christie playing both the magical and mortal monarchs — Hippolyta may have secretly conjured the fairy kingdom to terrorise her husband-to-be. Hytner chose to keep this ambiguous but it was an inspired suggestion and made sense of the decision to have the same two actors play these roles.
Christie was ably supported by a nimble, creepy, day-glo Puck, played by David Moorst who delivered a brilliantly original iteration of the beloved fairy: think Lee Evans meets Willem Dafoe. Moorst not only displayed a spectacular array of acrobatics but oscillated between mischievous contempt for the lovers he poisoned and genuine pathos once he realised the extent to which they had suffered. Like Animashaun, his delivery of the extra-textual additions felt incredibly natural, whilst the blurring of the fairy and courtly world were sinisterly underscored by his additional role as a quietly malevolent Philostrate.
An example of the production’s attention to detail and its capacity to elevate oft-forgotten moments in this oft-performed play was Philostrate’s address to the three couples prior to the Rude Mechanicals’ performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Prior to Theseus selecting their play, an array of other options are delivered by Philostrate and, rather than skate over these in the audience’s anticipation of Dream’s grand comedic climax, Hytner instead chose to have actors (who had already featured as fairies) appear onstage to represent those alternatives.
These ranged from a group of women grotesquely entangled in red balloons to a vaudevillian entertainer creating a paper chain of people, all of which was in service of an inspired final gag. Theseus’s decision was framed as a reality television-esque winner reveal, underscored by ever-diminishing lights and the dramatic music which erupted once the Mechanicals had been selected. Their adorable purple jumpers (which read ‘Rude Mechanicals’ on the back) underscored their position as amateurs amidst professionals. Truly, Athens Got Talent.
In my next article, I’ll focus in greater detail on these references to modern culture and, in particular, the popular music which featured throughout this dream of a show.

After checking out the Aegean Business Class Lounge it was time to board my Aegean business class flight from Athens to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my itinerary and how I booked the trip. Also see previous reviews of the ground experience in Newark for Emirates passengers, SAS Lounge at Newark, the Emirates business class flight from Newark to Athens, and my stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked this flight by transferring my Amex Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan, a program that typically has good redemption values.
In this case, the cost was 15,000 miles for business class, plus $86.50 in Canadian dollars in taxes and fees. I charged the taxes and fees to my Amex Platinum to take advantage of the 5x per dollar on airfare, no foreign transaction fees, and the generous travel protection benefits it offers.
For this flight, there was a coach seat available for 7,500 miles. And as a Star Alliance Gold member, I would have received priority check-in, baggage handling, and lounge access anyway. However, I decided the premium of 7,500 miles was worth it to try the experience, even if it only consisted of a blocked middle seat and perhaps better food for the 2-hour hop. This was my first flight on Aegean so I wanted the full experience.
I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate for my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV).
At the gate, I was surprised that there was not much by way of added security. Usually, flights to Israel feature additional security.
Boarding began relatively on time. Aegean elites, Business Class, and Star Alliance Gold passengers were invited to board immediately after the pre-board for young families and the disabled.
Priority boarding did seem to be enforced by the Aegean gate crew which is always appreciated.
Boarding moved pretty quickly and we pushed back relatively on time. There was a safety demonstration in Greek and English and we briefly taxied before taking off.
I was welcomed at the cabin door and directed to my seat in the small forward cabin. Aegean has an exclusively narrow-body fleet and even a few propeller planes. This flight was operated by one of Aegean’s Airbus A320 aircraft.
As is standard for European short-haul business, the Aegean business class cabin was standard coach seats with a blocked middle. While people love to make fun of the recliners in domestic forward cabins in the United States, they are an upgrade over the European standard.
I assigned myself 2C. As boarding slowed, the Aegean crew quickly welcomed us aboard and offered orange juice, sparkling wine, and water (served in real glassware).
The seats offered USB-A ports, which while not a full outlet, is great to have, but somewhat outdated with the move towards USB-C.
It’s also not guaranteed on short-haul flights in Europe, even on mainline carriers. While the extra space of an empty middle was nice, I hate how some airlines put a tray in. It would be nice to be able to lift the armrest and be able to spread out (as you can on British Airways Club Europe).
There was a card in the seat pocket advertising wifi and what’s available on the portal.
It was cool to see Aegean offer 10 minutes of free connectivity onboard. While a few carriers make wifi free in premium cabins and others are aiming to make wifi free for everyone, it’s nice that Aegean gives everyone a few minutes free.
Unfortunately, the wifi was not working on this flight, so I couldn’t test the connectivity. Most of the flight was over the Mediterranean, so I can’t say I’m too surprised that wifi was not working.
Aegean distributed paper menus that were printed in English and Greek. Despite the destination being Israel, they did not have menus in Hebrew.
I was impressed by the 3-page paper menu for such a quick flight. And while US carriers have European carriers beat in terms of the seat, European carriers usually beat on service and soft product in Euro-business.
I liked that there were 2 hot entrees available to choose from. Both, however, were animal protein so if you are vegetarian or vegan, I would recommend packing your own food or ordering a special meal. The 4 wines were all Greek or from the region, a local touch I liked.
There was an extensive drinks selection of soda, coffees, teas, beers, and spirits. Having espresso drinks on board is also a nice touch of European carriers. I wish US carriers had espresso on board short-haul flights.
Based on my pre-flight research, I determined Aegean uses Stogel for their kosher meals out of Athens. My general experience with Stogel is that the food is not great, so I did not order a kosher meal ahead of time. I took a picture of the base tray set up from my seatmate, but nothing else from the service. My seatmate reported that they enjoyed the food.
I self-catered, and just ordered some beverages.
The crew very were friendly and checked back to top up beverages. As it was a quick flight, the service wrapped up pretty fast, and I passed the time till landing by reading. I did dip into the forward lavatory, which was pretty tight, but nicely appointed.
When we landed, we didn’t spend too long taxiing before deplaning at a gate. Unfortunately, Israel does not offer fast-track immigration for premium passengers and waits can be quite lengthy. However, I was lucky to have a relatively quick queue and the wait for my bag wasn’t too long once I was through.
Given the tight security entering Israel, I did not take any photos of the arrival experience in Israel.
Aegean offers a very solid business-class product, especially given that short-haul routes dominate its network. While a more premium seat would be appreciated, the friendly crew, paper menus, and meals served on real glass and china gave the overall experience a premium feel. While Athens isn’t a major connecting hub, I would not hesitate to fly Aegean in the future.

As a writer, I’m a sucker for literary themed restaurants, especially those I stumble upon, which is exactly how I found the Little Kook in Athens. The restaurant changes themes seasonally and I was lucky enough to enjoy the Alice in Wonderland ambiance.
Surrounded by the chaos of Athens’ life, adults and children alike visibly exhaled when they entered the alleyway with tables lined under an archway of decorations. The vibrant colors, familiar characters, and smell of desserts in the air seemed to bring out the silliness in the patrons: laughter, photos, one older woman giving herself cat ears as she posed next to Alice.
The staff was dressed in full themed outfits. I first requested a menu from Alice, then the Mad Hatter, and only after asking the Mad Hatter a third time did I receive one. It crossed my mind that perhaps I misunderstood (I am navigating Greece as a non-Greek speaker) and this was one of those “purposely rude” establishments. Don’t worry, it’s not one of those restaurants.
Before I could order, a coffee drink was brought to my table. Sadly, it belonged to the man at the next table. I’m not sure if he ever received his. The server generously told me to keep what they brought and did not charge me for the drink.
After reviewing the English menu, I narrowed it down to ordering Granny’s Hair, The…

This week Mayor Giorgos Kaminis announced the creation of the Athens Partnership, a nonprofit vehicle established with guidance from Bloomberg Associates. The mission of the Athens Partnership is to facilitate public-private partnerships, supporting priority public programs in Athens, Greece. This uniquely positioned entity will intersect between city government and the private sector, leveraging the resources and strengths of both. It will allow the city, with philanthropic support, to address pressing needs and pilot new programs while evaluating their outcomes and merit for future investment.
As the migrant crisis and economic instability in Greece continue to deeply affect Athens residents, the Partnership will be one tool to help the city remain responsive and moving forward. Bloomberg Associates is honored to count Athens among its client cities.
Op-ed by Athens Mayor George Kaminis in the newspaper “Kathimerini Tis Kiriakis”

A Mayor who wishes to do his job properly in today’s Greece must always find a balance among four basic priorities. Firstly, he must ensure the daily operation of his city. Secondly, he must respond to the social needs constantly generated by the current economic crisis (soup kitchens, homeless shelters, distribution of primary need goods, social tutoring classes, etc.). Thirdly, he must react fast to the, special or by now usual, political uproars we have been experiencing in recent years (political violence, long term strikes, occupation of public buildings, extended delinquency etc.). Fourthly, in several cities, as for example Athens, the mayor is now required to deal also with the multiple consequences of the refugee/immigration issue threatening to deconstruct an entire society, the strengths of which are tested and have reached their limit in the last six years.
One would say that all of this constitutes a multifaceted reality, which every mayor acting under similar conditions is compelled to deal with. In some way, this chronic and multifaceted crisis that our country is going through has formulated a “normality” of its own, an explosive mixture of daily life and special circumstances, where the latter are clearly dominating, since daily life in our days obeys to no normal routine. The drastic reduction in resources, both in manpower and materials, along with a number of other factors have made extremely and unimaginably difficult the effort of a mayor to even accomplish elementary duties such as, e.g., sanitation.
It is not enough though to just keep our head above water. We must also have our eyes focused deep in the horizon. Our cities, especially the major ones, and Athens mainly, have eventually taken over the duty to prepare the country for the post-crisis times. What the central government has failed to realize for several years now is that there are actually municipalities that are innovative. This is what we’ve been doing for so long in Athens.
At the same time that we are dealing with the problems of today being absolutely focused on our job, we are also obligated to prepare for tomorrow, raising the bar to the height it should be as if everything around us was going well. We are constantly seeking new modes of action, with a stable outward orientation, in Greece as well as abroad. In Athens especially we have broadened the range of collaboration of the City, forming partnerships with all of the reliable agencies of the city: businesses, public organizations, professional and commercial chambers, universities, private sponsors and, certainly the active citizens of the Society of Citizens.
Today we are taking a step further. We created the Partnership for Athens or Athens Partnership, a non-profit organization promoting targeted synergies of the municipality with the private sector.
With the Athens Partnership we support infrastructure projects, but also initiatives to reinforce the social cohesion and economic development and by and large the improvement of the quality of life in the city. The Partnership is seeking to attract donations from foundations, businesses and private sponsors, among which of course are the Greeks Abroad. The organization and operation of the Partnership shall obey the most updated principles of accountability, transparency and effectiveness, with emphasis on the funding of innovative and pilot programs, which shall not only benefit the city but also the municipality through the transfer of modern know how. As an independent organization operating between the municipality of Athens and the private sector, the Athens Partnership combines the forces of both, with the final beneficiary being the resident of our city.
The Athens Partnership is following the tradition of successful prototypes that have been operating efficiently for several years in major cities abroad such as London, New York, Los Angeles, and Melbourne; they also have non-profit organizations cooperating creatively with the municipalities in vitally important sectors, like fighting poverty, dealing with crises and sustainable development.
The municipal authority of our city and myself, personally would like to extent our heartfelt thanks to all the private citizens and organizations in Greece and abroad that have supported at times the capital with donations and sponsorships. With the Athens Partnership we are capitalizing on the experience we have acquired and upgrading the quality of our cooperation with all those who are intended to help us in this difficult task that we have undertaken: to keep our city standing and methodically prepare it for the future.

I came with low expectations — a stopover, a few days at most. “It’s kind of chaotic,” a friend warned me. “Not like the islands.” But I landed, blinked into the bright Athenian sun, and something in me clicked.
It started with the coffee. Greeks take their coffee seriously, and I learned quickly that sipping a freddo espresso at a slow pace is practically a lifestyle here. I sat at a small café in Koukaki and watched the city swirl around me: scooters zipping past, old men arguing over backgammon, the Acropolis peeking out in the distance like it was eavesdropping on our conversations.
Athens has this joyful contradiction to it — ancient and alive. In one direction, you walk past ruins that have witnessed centuries. In the other, a street artist is painting a neon mural on a crumbling wall. It’s not a museum — it’s a mosaic. And somehow, it works.
I wandered through Plaka, where balconies overflowed with bougainvillea and cats napped in the sun like tiny emperors. I bought fresh koulouri from a street vendor for 50 cents and felt like I’d hacked happiness.
Then came the music. At sunset, I stumbled upon a group of musicians playing traditional Greek songs near Anafiotika. Strangers danced. Kids laughed. Someone handed me a drink and said “Kalosorises” — Welcome. I smiled so wide my cheeks hurt.
I kept walking. The golden hour in Athens is no joke. It bathes the entire city in honey — softening even the graffiti and concrete into something cinematic. I climbed Filopappou Hill and looked back at the Parthenon as the lights flicked on. It felt like the city was winking at me.
And just like that, I was in love.
Not with some idealized version of Athens, but with the real one. The imperfect, passionate, noisy, sun-soaked Athens that feeds you too much and talks too loud and insists you stay just a little longer.
By the end of the afternoon, I stopped being a tourist. I was a guest. Maybe even something more.
Athens didn’t just surprise me — it lifted me. Reminded me that joy doesn’t have to be loud to be deep. That sometimes, happiness is a glass of cold white wine on a rooftop with strangers who feel like old friends, and a city that feels like home — even if it isn’t yours.

Note to Readers:
These reflections are simply my personal observations and interpretations, based on my experiences in Athens. I understand that myths, religions, and cultures are deeply subjective and complex. While the stories and comparisons might resonate differently with others, I hope to offer a glimpse into how I viewed these intersections from my own perspective. At the end of the day, we all bring our unique lenses to the world, and it is through these diverse viewpoints that we learn from each other.
The story of the city of Athens being named so starts with a scene of a duel between Athena and Poseidon. A king sought a patron deity for the city who would protect it from attacks and bless its citizens. Both gods were interested.
The venue for the duel was decided to be at the top of a hill where Acropolis stands today. Poseidon struck his trident on the ground and out came gushing water. People ran to have a sip of what they thought was holy. It turned out to be saline, reinforcing Poseidon’s dominion over the Sea. Then Athena struck her staff and there emerged a beautiful olive tree. Olive proved invaluable to the greeks: Its wood were used to make boats that helped them trade, fruits made pickles, seed pressed for oil. Therefore, Athena was chosen as the patron deity. [1]
However, this enraged Poseidon who cursed the city with floods. To calm him, Athenians built a temple for Poseidon at Cape Sounion, overlooking the sea, his kingdom.
The Greek gods, I realised, seemed to differ from Hindu gods in how they were influenced by emotions and expressed unpredictability in actions, which many might term as impulsive and unjust. This caused a lot of dissonance to me because of the striking contrast to Hindu deities or gods I’ve grown up around, who although express emotions, but never allow these to cloud their judgment or be unrighteous. (There are exceptions ofc, but statistically insignificant and associated with taboo). Over the course of the trip, in a conversation with my guides, I reached the conclusion that Greek gods reflect psychological archetypes, while the Hindu gods represented ethical ideals. It seems like a classic case of Prescriptive vs Cautionary approaches. I will explain this with an example later.
Meanwhile, let's take a short detour to understand present circumstances in Greece.
I arrived in Greece at night, and the first sights that greeted me were far from the postcard-perfect images of Santorini and Mykonos areas. My stay was in a residential area of Omania, away from the curated tourist experience, and I was taken aback by the sheer poverty, homelessness and drug abuse, that lined the streets.
Greece’s economic crisis played a large role in this. After joining the EU, the government underreported its actual debt, making the economy seem more stable than it was. When the truth surfaced, investor confidence collapsed, and the country fell to debt crisis.
Because Greece uses the euro, it couldn’t devalue its currency to make exports more competitive, closing gates to making an economic comeback. People lost jobs, rural population migrated to Athens, to the point that today almost one-third of Greece lives in Athens alone. This led to a strain on urban amenities. The symptoms were very visible to me. I saw open defecation, men and women fighting and desperate looks from beggars scanning passerbys.
It busted the myth which the British perpetuated in colonized India that white man is superior by nature because he is inherently civilized. [2] Turns out, stripped of prosperity, social stability decays everywhere. That social stability and ‘in-group members trust’ is more a function of economic security than a function of race, was an assuring observation.[3]
Although the situation is too complex to be done justice in a paragraph, it can be said that misplaced intention to generate political good-will coupled with several other factors instead of investing in avenues which would ensure multiplier effect in the economy, Greece fell deeper into the debt trap. (I believe we would help ourselves by applying this lesson to the worsening situation with Freebies in India.)
While Greece faces serious economic struggles, I was moved by the resilience and warmth of the Greek people despite their hardships. They were nice and straightforward, even weary of their circumstances. Tourism keeps their economy afloat but I could sense their quiet frustration with tourists. And although you can’t quiet bite the hands that feed you, you are free to resent the fact that you have to rely on it.
Anyways, back to our cultural discussion. The next day started with a tour of Acropolis. It is at the center of the city, both geographically and historically. The Greek civilisation was a cluster of city-states, each with their own Patron Deity. However, they all worshipped a shared pantheon of 12 Olympian gods.[4]
The Acropolis itself houses three key temples, each dedicated to different aspects of Athena. The Parthenon, the grandest, is dedicated to Athena Parthenos (the Virgin Goddess). The Erechtheion is tied to the myth of Athena’s contest with Poseidon, and the Temple of Athena Nike honors her as the goddess of victory. [5]
Built fully out of marble, the columns of The Parthenon stand huge, with the doors facing the east. This was done intentionally to have the sun’s first ray in the morning fall upon Athena’s idol, which was around 12 meters tall and was said to have been built out of Gold and Ivory. Must have been a beautiful sight to behold!
However, there is no idol there anymore. It was destroyed in the later years as Hellenism fell and the temple became a church first and a mosque later. What stands today is just a few columns, although the government is now working to reconstruct the temple, asserting its central role in the Greek tourism and economy.
In fact a culture-preservation law prohibits any building in athens to be taller than 103 meters, ensuring that the Acropolis must be visible from all corners of the city and should be the highest point.[6]
The funny thing however is that right next to the hill of Acropolis, I saw Mount Lycabettus, with a Greek Orthodox chapel at the top, exactly twice the height of Acropolis. Orthodox Christianity is the state religion of Greece and I couldn’t help but wonder if the placement of this chapel — literally twice higher than the sacred Acropolis — was a subtle statement of the new religious order.
Hellenism survives today in form of modern reconstructions of rituals from textual sources and around 2000 people follow the religion in private. [7] . Private, I emphasise, because the Hellenics have had a tough time recently opening a temple because the temple supervisor was jailed on inauguration day and the church released an official statement, urging the adherents of the true faith “not to be led astray”.[8] The funniest thing, the Right to practice religion is an inviolable right in the Greek constitution and it was essentially ensured to the adherents of hellenic religion after its official recognition in 2017.[9] Critics have cited the lack of proper official procedures and other troublesome aspects underlining the reason behind closure of the temple but I am of the firm belief that this is outside the scope of our discussion and is purely concern of the involved parties. We have no right to impose our POV over theirs, since the stakes differ.
Hellenism died a slow brutal death. I call it brutal because unlike the forces that actively engage in demeaning pagan practices today, did not even find Hellenism worthy of being opposed in the Roman ages. The Romans in-fact absorbed the greek pantheon, often reshaping characters and stories. The real blow came with the Fall of Rome to Christianity where Hellenism was actively suppressed (Theodosian Decrees which outlawed pagan practices).
Greek gods derive their stories from texts like The Odyssey and The Iliad and these stories (to say the least), though fascinating, feel scandalous to the modern mind. Like the story of Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and fire, who was physically deformed and married to Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite had an extramarital affair with Ares, the god of war. This angered Hephaestus who created a magical web to trap Ares and Aphrodite in the “act” in order to shame them in front of public. They were trapped and Hephaestus called the gods to witness the blatant unrighteousness. The gods simply laughed at all of them and let it slide. No one was punished. No consequence whatsoever.[10]
When such stories and their morality were challenged by the Greek philosophers, the priestly class did not seem equipped to handle the questions. In fact, instead of reasoning or applying intellectual capacity, some even tried to silence the dissent. Philosophers like Socrates, who offered alternate theories of Godhood, were thrown in prison on charges of “corrupting the youth” (shown in picture).[11] This is in severe contrast to the brahmanical approach where the response was to strengthen arguments and rationalize actions, codifying them even, which is probably the reason why Hinduism survives today. The natural response of the Vedic society to Buddhist rise was the systematic Refutation of Śūnyavāda (Doctrine of Emptiness) by Mīmāṃsakas led by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, which was later followed by the rise of Ādi Śaṅkarācārya who brought the Vedic teachings to their logical conclusions.
This is also be traced to the differing roles of the priestly class in a Hindu and Hellenic society. While the hellenic priests often acted as a medium between the gods and the common mass, conducting rituals, orally communcating stories and seeking blessings, the priestly class in Hindu society served multifold roles of conducting rituals, preserving texts, codifying ethics and asserting supremacy of The Vedas. Hinduism’s ability to absorb, debate, and reformulate ideas, even in the face of external challenges, is a significant strength. [12][13]
Although the Vedic Paramparā also distinguishes between Karma Kāṇḍa (ritual action) and Jñāna Kāṇḍa(knowledge), the traditional Gurukula system trained students across a wide spectrum of disciplines — ranging from astronomy and mathematics to linguistics, logic, and philosophy. This stands in striking contrast to ancient Greece, where schools of philosophy often developed independently of the priestly or ritualistic traditions, leading to a sharper divide between intellectual inquiry and religious practice.
The stories of gods were also contrasting, with common undertones of personified emotions. During an interaction with another Greek Mythology enthusiast, who quoted me this story of Aphrodite and Ares (the underlying theme being adultery and passion) , I was immediately reminded of the story of Lord Hanumān doubting his capabilities before making a leap to Lanka. It took him a trusted aide in the form of Jāmbavān to remind him of his true powers, set aside his doubts and take a leap across the seas. His story underlines the common theme of self-doubt and imposter syndrome that all of us face, whilst also providing a solution — seeking reassurance from a trusted friend or mentor.
If Greece taught me anything it is that Bharat and Bhartiyata are here to stay. Our ancestors have left us with an unshakable foundation — a profound source of strength and reassurance. Big white pill.
Yes, people might moving towards and away with time, but to quote His Holiness The Late Shankaracharya of Dwarkapeeth
“the seed will never perish. A minority shall always remain faithful to traditions…….. and that will be enough to keep it from getting lost”.
Around 2000 people in Greece still follow Hellenism. Zeus, Athena, and Dionysus are quitely worshipped in the altars of their homes. Their festivals have found a way to stay alive.
If a tradition, once our contemporary, can stay alive in shadows, how much stronger must ours be?
For over a thousand years, around 130 Agnihotri families have kept the sacred Agni alive. [14]
The Vedas are today chanted on the Ghats of Kashi, exactly like they were chanted 4000 years ago.
Indra, Varuna, and Mitra are still offered oblations.
The lineage of our Acharyas remains strong. The saints and realized beings still walk around us, in subtle and physical forms.
Our deities still respond to our prayers.
The institutions are still around to produce another Shivaji, another Vivekananda, and another Chandragupta Maurya.
People still chant the name of Shri Rama. Glory be to Him. Glory be to Maa Bharti for staying so strong even on the face of severe onslaughts. And Glory be to the Divine Mother for making me a Bhartiya first and an Indian second.
Seeing how remnants of Hellenism persist, despite centuries of suppression, made me appreciate how deeply rooted traditions find ways to survive. It reminded me of my own traditions and their resilience. Across cultures: faith, memory, and heritage endure in the hearts of people, waiting for the right moment to shine again.

If you follow Coworkies regularly, we’ve taken you to many different cities already. From New York to Shanghai or lately Prague, we’ve shared stories of people creating an impact on their cities by building incredible local coworking scenes. This month, we bring you to a whole new city, one we did talk about yet: Athens.
Why did we go to Athens? So many reasons!
Aside from discover a beautiful city full of History, we were curious to:
In just 2 days, we were lucky enough to find all the answers to our questions. To discover it too, scroll down and enjoy the ride through Athens unique coworking scene.
With 665,000 inhabitants in the city proper (3.75 Mo for the larger Athens) and more than 5 Mo tourists a year, Athens is without a doubt one of the lungs of Greece. Over the last decade, this lung has been heavily damaged by one of the toughest economical crisis of its History that has impacted many professionals and industries, from corporate companies to freelancers.
How did coworking grew in the middle of such a difficult time, let’s have look!
/ Facts and figures.
Unless other European capital cities such as Berlin or London, coworking has reached Athens later, more precisely in 2010 with the opening of CoLab workspace, which does not exist anymore. Until 2012, the entire country was counting 4 coworking spaces, which is a really low number that can also be explained and aligned with the crisis the country encountered as well as a lack of education about the term coworking itself.
Indeed, for a country of 11.3 Mo inhabitants, counting 4 coworking spaces does not help in spreading the word and educating the population to the new ways of working. But a wind of change has hit the country and today, in Athens only, there are about 10 coworking spaces that have flourished, offering various concepts to freelancers, companies and startups:
Now that the introduction is made, let’s dig deeper into Athens coworking scene, from the days it started to today!
Coworkies in Athens.
All and all, we spent 1 and half day in Athens and one thing is sure, we did not rest. We had the pleasure to visit 6 coworking spaces, in different areas of Athens. The diversity of spaces we came across was pretty impressive. Above all, what has impressed us even more is the people making Athens coworking scene what is is. Each one of them has a unique story that reflects in her/his space. In Athens, we’ve come across education in coworking spaces. We’ve also visited makerspace for Artists or Companies. Lastly, we’ve even had a yummy lunch prepared by refugees in a coworking space with a social impact.
We invite you to explore Athens with us by browsing around our interactive map of spaces we’ve seen! Some hidden tips and stories not present in this article are hidden in there, will you be able to find them?
The following piece has been co-written with coworking spaces from Athens. Thank you The Cube, Stone Soup and Athens Makerspace for contributing.
Did you know that, CoLab, which opened in 2010 and has now been transformed and renamed The Cube, was actually an idea pitched at the Startup Weekend?
“Like many we had also been directly affected by the crisis in Greece and we were bold and crazy enough to create our next job investing everything we had and didn’t have into a crazy new adventure. It’s been a real roller coaster but so worth it and rewarding.” — Maria, co-founder of The Cube.
Since CoLab, other coworking spaces have flourished in Athens.
In 2011, Loft2Work opened its doors, with the vision to build a space Encouraging & supporting Social Entrepreneurship as a means to promote social justice and alleviate poverty. Loft2Work was also very popular for organizing events centered on people rather than on businesses.
In 2012, 123p opened its doors with the objective to become THE place in town for startups. Renamed today the Found.ation, it is the leading technology and innovation enabling platform in SE Europe, acting as a startup hub, a digital transformation accelerator for corporations and a tech education hive.
Coworking has no borders and this is very true for Impact Hub Athens. After studying in Vienna and Madrid and working out of Impact Hub in both respective cities, , Dimitris Kokkinakis and Sophie Lamprou, returned to Athens and decided to create the brand there in 2013. Since then, Impact Hub Athens has had tremendous impact on the city, gathering professionals working for social good and organizing some of the most incredible project such as El Sistema Greece which promotes inclusion and integration for refugee children through music education and even had a huge concert at the Acropolis last summer.
In 2014, Olga and Klaas have opened Stone Soup. When we asked Olga what pushed them to open a coworking space, she told us, she got inspired by Amsterdam.
“The Dutch capital inspired me professionally, made me confident and showed me how to put in action my ideas. It also convinced me that the north was not my place to be. I came back to Greece with the dream to implement better the work I was doing in Amsterdam. I thought I would do it better because in Greece it mattered more and the impact would be bigger for my entourage and myself. So I started networking and bringing people together and we started sharing the same roof, working together and making plans for new projects, or in other words, I initiated Stone Soup by placing a pot with water on fire and threw in it some stones. Then it all started cooking…” — Olga, Stone Soup
The people of Stone Soup are…
“Professionals with one foot set in Greece and the other somewhere abroad. You cannot afford to be based only in Greece nor to depend your sales only in the local market. I think the people that surround us are motivated and adventurous with great stories to share and they can surely inspire you. They like the warm and casual vibe at Stone Soup. The ability to easily interact with other co-workers and the feeling of ownership at the space. We started as a cooperative space, and while we maintain our coop ideals, we have matured as a business and we offer our services in a more structured way. But we remain open. Whomever would like to join, they are welcome. We do not ask for a membership fee in order to share our network or knowledge and we try to operate with no strings attached. “
What if an old cosmetic factory could transform into a beautiful and modular coworking space? This is exactly what happened in 2016, when Th. Tsiropoulos and V. Stavropoulos opened the beautiful Tzaferi16. The modern and contemporary look of the space makes it a great place not only for work but also for events.
But Athens is not just about coworking spaces. The makers scene is also growing and flourishing, We visited Athens Makerspace, a young non profit organisation, founded in March 2016. When Ilias and his team started it, their vision was clear:
“Every person, of every age, must have access to the tools and knowledge they need to implement their ideas. We associate ourselves with the ideas of sustainable design, innovation and fabrication.”
What do people work on at Athens Makerspace? Well, pretty much anything it seems:
“Our members work on a variety of projects. We have amateurs, intermediate makers and professionals. So many amazing creations are taking place in our makerspace. Members who use the laser cutter to create jewelry, handbags, signs and more to sell. Members using the woodshop and electronics lab to create a full size arcade. Members who use the 3D printers and the electronics lab to create custom automations and robots. A member who uses the sewing machine to create reusable tea bags and much more. We are even developing production methods to upcycle plastic waste. Our members can use our equipment for practical, professional or artistic reasons. They are encouraged to innovate, prototype solutions meet other makers, learn and share their knowledge. There are so many possibilities. The sky is the limit!”
The opening of Athen Makerspace has inspired others. LUDD a lab for Open Design and Fabrication opened its doors in 2017. More than just a space, LUDD is a platform where the latest developments in open design, prototyping and fabrication technology, along with shared know-how, serve as the basis for a community of individuals, organizations and broader initiatives, to connect and collaborate, thus accelerating local innovation. We had the pleasure to visit Manolis, one of the co-founder and his team and were really impressed by the amount of cool projects that are built in the space. From furniture to more complex pieces, creativity has no boundaries at LUDD.
Today, Athens coworking and maker scenes have reached a new milestone. With more than 10 coworking spaces around the city and more coming, the population becomes more and more familiar with the concept of coworking and its benefits.
Chatting with our contributors, they gave us very different perspective on it:
“But I think lately it has evolved to a more self-sustained business and the market is growing. I think people are more cautious about making claims as to how much the startup hype is able to support the co-working business and the overall economy.” — Olga, Stone Soup
“The fact that we started the 1st coworking space in Athens in times of crisis actually helped people think outside the box and become go getters, innovate and create their next job not wait for it. Greeks are Entrepreneurs and we all know that crisis also brings change and opportunity with it. There is a lot of brain drain but at the same time one of our services is recruiting local talent to international companies that are trying to and looking into the market in establishing here in Athens, this way giving the talent a reason to stay.” Maria, co-founder of The Cube.
Chatting about the makers scene, it is also growing and changing:
“There are a few interesting spaces in Athens that promote the maker movement. We are very proud that Athens Makerspace is the first. The unique aspect of the maker scene in our city is that it shares the Greek idea of the community. People from different organisations want to meet in the same event, have a good time and work on a project together. We give our best to make our city better in any way we can. Fortunately, there are many opportunities for people to make their ideas a reality, share their knowledge and teach others. We understand one another and we also welcome newcomers who really want to learn and be part of the community”. In the centre of Athens there are so many hidden little shops that you can buy handmade objects or materials for your project. Some of them dating decades back. The maker scene here has a beautiful history full of handcrafters that we are trying to uphold.” Andriana, Community Manager, Athens Makerspace
a discussion with the local coworking actors.
Maria, Co-founder The Cube
“It has great potential things are changing, we have been past the hive phase and the community is maturing. The biggest problem is bureaucracy into setting up and running a business in Greece and as I already mentioned brain drain and talent moving abroad seeking for opportunities at this current phase.”
Olga, Co-founder Stone Soup
“I think the scene will become a lot more international. When we started almost 100% of our residents were Greek but now you can see 50% Greek and the other half is a mixture of different nationalities. People come either to live in Athens or to spend some time (1–3 months). The digital nomad paradigm is getting of the ground.”
Andriana, Community Manager, Athens Makerspace
“There are 3 reasons why we believe that in the future more people will prefer making, repairing, upcycling or reusing than buying.
First of, the environmental awareness is currently spreading and thankfully becoming part of our everyday life will be the main reason for that.
Secondly, many makers are finding a way to make a living through their creations ($$$!). And last but not least, despite the above, creative thinking and handmaking is a very important part of life that has been ignored in the past decades. It creates a special bond with all the stuff that surrounds us, adding so much value to everything that is custom-made rather than mass produced. Plus, it is proven to provide some serious psychotherapy in this rapidly evolving world.
We really hope that in the near future, schools will start incorporate the making aspect in their teaching methods. Building mini makerspaces in-school or asking people to do workshops for the students or even have a teacher that specializes in this field. The hands-on education is proven to be an amazing method and we believe that it’s time for schools in Athens to embrace it.
Also something that we notice more and more lately is the increase of women in the maker movement. Right now we have more women working on projects in Athens Makerspace than we ever did. We really hope and believe that this will continue as the social stereotypes that created a gender imbalance in the community, gradually fade.”

My partner and I love to travel! (I mean who doesn’t?) Therefore we decided to visit the magnificent Greek city also known as Athens! You may be sitting there questioning the title, (Cricket, Cricket) and some of you may have guessed by now. Even though Athens is the capital city of Greece and a place that's crowded with shopaholics- the sound of crickets fill the air all day long. However, I am sure the locals are used to it.
When it comes to travelling we always try to budget and can always stick to it! (That is a complete lie.) We think about the places we want to visit and places we want to stay. Wherever in the world you may visit — you do not always get to visit each and every corner of the city, so our top attractions/activities depend on the amount of time we have in that city.
How many days is enough to visit Athens?
The time spent in a city all depends on the reason for visiting. For example you may visit for the beautiful sceneries, the outstanding history or you just love to open up your wallet and get straight into those bougie stores. However, in our case we just wanted to wallow in to delicious food and visit the still standing historical attractions. We had spent just under 2 nights in Athens. That is more than enough time to see the top attractions and indulge in all the finest foods Athens has to offer.
Two nights? Run me through your itinerary…
Sure. We arrived midday of August, and as soon as we landed and stepped foot outside the airport- the August heat lashed onto our skins! This may sound overdramatic- but do bare in mind we are from England and the sun does not do us great favours! As I was saying, the heat was a lot and we had to find transport to reach us to our accommodation. I love to use public transport when we travel to a foreign country and I am slightly against using taxis all the time unless it’s needed. Only because it takes away the enjoyment of feeling what it is like living like a local. However, I did regret this as soon as we reached because :
BUT mainly because
2. Public transport was not looking promising- it was overly crowded and that’s not what you want when you are carrying around your suitcase and a few other bags. So eventually we found a cab (baring in mind this took up to an hour) that took us straight to our accommodation.
Once we reached our apartment — we freshened up and gushed ourselves with sunscreen lotion! (Wearing sunscreen lotion sometimes feels like you are going to war with the sun — I mean you kind of are if you think about it.)
We decided to visit the most famous attractions of Athens first- I mean it would be an insult not to! The Acropolis and The Parthenon. On the way there I was imagining what it would look like — of course I knew the scenery would be beautiful but photos do not do justice — it looked incredible! ( Now for those of you that do not know what the The Acropolis is — well then you will just have to Google it.) It was a sight that caught my eye. Stairs took you straight to the top of the attraction and there you could take in the breath-taking views. (I will leave some helpful tips at the end, so do have a look.)
Next, we were starving — so we decided to take our last few photos and get some lunch/dinner (can we call that chinner?) We wanted to try Greek food- however, when it comes to being a vegetarian it is not that simple, especially in Europe.
First stop: Street Souvlaki — Gyros time! How was it? Personally, I liked it. It was stuffed with aubergine, courgette, halloumi cheese and chips and drizzled with chilli jam. Ok, for those of you that don’t love their vegetables this may not sound appealing — but it was good, I liked it. My husband on the other hand, ‘eh’. For those of you that don’t know what that means, it means, well it means ‘eh’.
Next cheeky stop: crêpes anyone? Yes please! Whatever happens on holiday stays on holiday and in your belly. Dessert is a must on holiday so we found a cute little dessert shop that were making crêpes and the smell dragged us in! We bought a crepe to share, (which we don’t usually do, but hey sharing is caring.) The smell of Nutella tickled by taste buds and to top it of with some Strawberries.
Day 2: Don’t cha wish you girlfriend liked to shop like me? Don’t cha… (no not really)
The above title is giving mixed messages to you all — Yes, Athens is great for shopping — but we visited a few stores and we were done! I guess shopping isn’t for everyone. But for those of you that love shopping the main place to visit would be Ermou Street.
Next, we decided to visit: The Acropolis Museum
Which was filled with historical artefacts from the ancient times. It was fascinating and definitely worth the visit. Below the museum lay a phenomenal ancient civilisation which has been preserved very well. Archaeologists had used the remains of what was found to get an idea of what the different areas were used for.
Lastly, we decided to go for dinner before we called it a night. We decided to fill our bellies with indian food, so we visited Namaste — which is a walking distance from the museum. The food was delicious. Authentic? Yes, very much.
That was all for Athens. Next stop — Naxos! But hey that’s for another day.
Check out the helpful tips below:
2. Keep a hat, sunglasses, water and sunscreen with you at all times. ( if you didn’t guess so already — it gets kind of hot.)
3. I would recommend to book a taxi when arriving in Athens to take you to your accommodation. Taxis were a nightmare to find/contact. (Uber does work in Athens — so we used this. For the rest of your trip you can use public transport but the scheduled times are not always correct.)
4. There is a lot of walking involved when you want to visit the main attractions — I do recommend hiring a car. Unless you love to walk — then go ahead!
5. Greek Salad is amazing! Definitely try it out.
6. Baklava is popular in Greece so I would try this too.

Stepping off the metro and into the sun-drenched streets of Athens feels like opening a history book with the pages still whispering secrets. The air carries a warm, dry breeze laced with the scent of jasmine and grilled souvlaki. You turn a corner, and there it is: the Acropolis, standing guard over the city like an old friend greeting you after years apart.
No photograph truly captures the magic of the Acropolis. The way the Parthenon’s marbled columns glow rose-gold at dusk, or how the ancient stones hum with stories of philosophers and poets cannot be fully conveyed. Standing before this magnificent ancient structure, you can directly feel the wonder created by human creativity and perseverance. The Parthenon, standing firm for 2,500 years, is not merely a building but a symbol of human civilization that transcends time, offering a moment that stays in your heart.
Lose yourself in Plaka, Athens’ old neighborhood nestled at the Acropolis foot. Cobblestone lanes twist between pastel houses draped in bougainvillea, their wobbly pavement echoing every step you take. Every corner reveals a tiny kafenío spilling laughter and card games, a cat sunning itself on a doorstep, or an artisanal shop selling hand-painted ceramics. Stay close to a map, but feel free to get delightfully lost — each turn brings a new discovery.
In Monastiraki, the pulse of modern Athens beats alongside relics of every era. Street musicians serenade you near the flea market, where you can barter for vinyl records, vintage postcards, or a well-loved leather bag. Perch on the marble steps of Hadrian’s Library, feeling centuries-old stones under your fingertips while absorbing the vibrant energy of the streets.
Walking through Athens, you’ll discover the remarkable coexistence of modern and ancient. You might be strolling down a busy shopping street and suddenly encounter the ruins of a Roman-era amphitheater, or see columns of the 2,000-year-old ancient Agora standing right next to a modern coffee shop. Especially at sunset, the ancient ruins take on an almost living quality in the golden light that embraces the city.
With every step, the pavement beneath your feet seems to tell stories of the past. When you place your hand on an old stone wall, the warmth of the stone that has stood in that place for thousands of years creates a connection to the past through your palm. In Athens’ narrow alleyways, echoes sometimes reverberate, sounding almost like the whispers of ancient Greeks.
During my stay, I had the opportunity to visit the historic Piraeus Port on a business trip. As Athens’ main harbor for over 2,500 years, Piraeus offers a fascinating blend of maritime heritage and modern commerce. The bustling port, one of the largest in the Mediterranean, serves as Greece’s gateway to the world and a reminder of the nation’s enduring connection to the sea.
Walking along the waterfront, I watched massive cruise ships and cargo vessels docked alongside traditional fishing boats, their colorful hulls bobbing gently in the harbor. The scent of salt water mingled with the aroma of fresh seafood from tavernas lining the marina. Locals call this area “the heart of Greek shipping,” and it’s easy to see why — the energy here is different from central Athens, more cosmopolitan yet deeply rooted in maritime tradition.
After my meetings concluded, I explored the charming neighborhoods surrounding the port. Mikrolimano, with its horseshoe-shaped marina lined with seafood restaurants, offered stunning views where I watched fishermen mending their nets — a practice unchanged for centuries. In Pasalimani, elegant yachts suggested modern luxury while the nearby Archaeological Museum of Piraeus housed bronze statues recovered from the harbor’s depths, a testament to the port’s ancient significance.
The contrast between Piraeus and central Athens provided a fuller understanding of Greek identity — while the Acropolis represents Greece’s philosophical and cultural heritage, Piraeus embodies its seafaring spirit and commercial prowess that have sustained the nation throughout history.
On my last evening, I climbed Filopappou Hill just as the sun dipped below the Aegean horizon. The city sprawled beneath me — rust-red rooftops giving way to olive groves and distant azure. A street musician began to strum a haunting melody on his bouzouki, each note drifting through the twilight haze. I closed my eyes and let the music, the breeze, the ancient stones all blend together. In that instant, Athens wasn’t just a city of ruins; it was a living masterpiece, forever echoing with the laughter, dreams, and tears of everyone who ever called it home.
Athens isn’t about rushing from one selfie spot to the next. It’s about pausing to feel time fold onto itself — sharing sweet moments with locals at dawn, or watching street life unfold as light dances across the Acropolis. It’s a place that invites you to slow down, to breathe in history, and to savor both the grand and the minute details of daily life. When you leave, you carry a piece of that magic with you — a sense of grounded wonder and the comforting knowledge that some moments are eternal.
Safe travels, dear friend. May your heart be as full as mine was, and may Athens whisper its stories to you, too.

The night I slept in Exarcheia was perhaps the turning point. My phone had been stolen, I had been caught at the airport six times, each time returned. I had even once dyed my hair blond and worn coloured lenses to appear more ‘European’ — it seems so ridiculous now.
In Exarcheia I was surrounded by hashashin, every nation, class and colour united in smoking weed, perhaps the best form of integration there is. It was cold, January 2017, and I was lucky, because it was the only night that I slept outside, unlike so many others.
I woke the next morning and came across another guy, also young like me, with green eyes, from Latakia. He had also slept on the street that night, but he looked so clean I could not believe he was sleeping rough. Seeing him, a guy more or less my age in the same situation, made me realise that I was not alone and that there were so many others like me trying to find a way to survive. After so many failures, sleeping on the street, losing so much money on wasted attempts to smuggle myself out of Greece, I began to understand that this was not the path for me.
That morning at 5am I went to Katekhaki (the Greek asylum service) and I also received my first fine for not paying my metro ticket. I took the fine, smiled, said, ‘efharisto poly’ (thank you very much in Greek) and kept on towards Katekhaki, throwing away the paper fine on the way.
This was the first fine of forty similar fines I would receive over the next two years, thanks to the incredible Greek system of fining people who clearly cannot pay their tickets. As a conscientious member of Greek society now, I pay my monthly transport, but those fines amounted to 1,200 euros. Of course, I never ever thought of that at the time.
Why did I go to Katekhaki? Because six months previously I had not attended my asylum interview — I had been far too focused on the idea of getting out of Greece to find my brother in Sweden. Besides, no one helped you in Greece, there was no accommodation, the only option for me was the squats. It did not feel like a place that offered stability, or a future. But now it seemed like I needed to change my plan, and so I went to Katekhaki and took my asylum card and the date for my interview, which was to be three months later. I returned to Exarcheia, managed to stay in a squat for three days and there met a group of Spanish people who were to offer me my first place to stay.
I began to plan. To me, the most important things was finding a job, and so I thought about what seemed to me to be a previous life, but one that had given me experiences that now I could draw upon.
In Damascus I had always been interested in technology — my brother had bribed me to do well in my exams with the promise of a laptop. He tricked me and gave the laptop to someone else, but then relented and bought me a newer one; he could see how much it meant to me I think.
I had studied technology in college for a while and then in Turkey I had managed to get some work at Vodaphone and had started to study coding. Whenever I needed to learn something I went to one place: youtube. Since Damascus, through Turkey and here in Greece, it is always the place I go to for learning new things, for inspiration and motivation.
I began to work, buying old phones and then mending and updating them and selling them on. I even made money online — just imagine 989 euros in my paypal, untouchable because there was no account for it to be transferred to. No one would accept my Greek Asylum white card as valid ID. I felt as if I was some sort of ethereal phantom, magically working online, but for no material benefit, except for the personal satisfaction of seeing the numbers on the screen and dreaming about what I would do with the money if it was physically in my possession.
Many things have happened since then, many of which we will all experience in our lives as refugees — the struggle to find a job, a home, a way to build a life. I realise I am not unique in this sense and this motivated me to try and help others in any way I can.
For a year I was lucky to be involved with a youth centre which gave me accommodation in exchange for volunteering there. I was always trying to think of new ways of making money within the narrow confines of Greek law where you cannot have a bank account unless you have a job. I helped people write CVs, gave courses on computer software, computer literacy, anything that I felt could be helpful for people like me looking for a future here.
I got a job, went to the training and got 99% on my coding exam, although to be honest it was my third retake. Then the company told me to go home, because the Greek system did not issue my AFM (tax number) fast enough. I tried everything, applying from different offices, with my company (which arranges all the necessary visas, AFMs and accommodation for their foreign workers), on my own, with a Greek person, anything! In the Exarcheia office where I originally registered I went with a Greek friend to check on the progress of my AFM which I had submitted a month previously. Eventually one clerk at the office whispered to my friend, ‘the person you need to talk to is in the toilet. Wait until he comes out and try and get him before he goes into the office.’ A couple of minutes later a large man with an even larger belly waddled out of the toilet, sideways. My friend tried to speak with him, but all she received was a dismissive gesture and a grunt. I had felt as if I had done everything, I had never given up, I had given so much of my time to learning and teaching others and had got this job, only to lose it because of a stupid bureaucracy.
It seems so funny now, looking back on it, because a month after that we returned and I managed to get my AFM, from the same toad-man. It had arrived maybe 10 days after I had visited the first time, but they had never bothered to call me.
In my despair my Greek friend put it in perspective. She too had suffered from this system, it was not specifically discrimination because I was a refugee, but rather an inefficient system that makes it impossible even for ordinary Greeks to do apparently simple things. Obtaining an AFM was my right as someone with residency, I had to be reminded that it would come eventually, that this was part of the journey, even if it felt as if Greece wanted me to personally suffer.
That was two months ago. Now, one AFM, a bank account and a 1,200 euro fine later, I am working as a software developer in a company that I dreamed of working for when I was in Syria. I could not have done this in Germany, France, Belgium or Holland, and so, although I spent so much time and money trying to escape this country, it turns out that this is one of the few places I can actually get the experience I need to continue my career.
What kept me going after that night in Exarcheia, before that in Turkey and Lesvos, was always having a plan and working out how to make it happen. In every situation, even if it is new, or potentially stressful and unfamiliar, I see opportunities to explore, make new contacts, learn something new. I truly believe that anyone can do what I have done, they just need focus, flexibility and a willingness to learn.
Be independent, do not follow the bad habits of others, and recognize that sometimes what works for others may not work for you. Make the most of your time and plan your day, week, month, even your year. Wherever you go there are opportunities to learn. Even in Athens, where I thought there was nothing, there are lots of different places that offer amazing training in languages and other skills.
Live in the present, but always think about the next step, and trust yourself. And use youtube!

Socrates’ borough or deme was Alopece, located in the immediate suburbs of Athens to the southeast. In his constitutional reforms of 508 BC, Cleisthenes identified and distributed the hundred and thirty-nine demes among ten administrative “tribes,” replacing four mutually hostile kinship tribes. He designed the new mapping to break up family dynasties and regional interest groups, so as to force people from different regions of Attica to work together (ch. 2*). The new tribes were given important political functions; for instance, each tribe annually elected a general to serve as one of the commanders of the Athenian armed forces for that year.
Each tribe also contributed fifty members to the Council every year, and each deme received proportionate representation within their tribe’s cohort of members. Socrates’ Alopece, belonging to the tribe of Antiochis, sent ten citizens to the Council annually. Socrates himself would serve his deme as a Council representative in the year 407/6 BC (see ch. 19.4*).
After the deme system was configured based on the geographical location of boroughs in Attica, one’s membership in it became hereditary. Consequently, the son always belonged to the deme of his father, even if he moved to another location and resided within the geographical boundaries of a different deme. In reality, however, people tended to remain in the same villages for centuries, as was often the case in Europe before recent times. Socrates’ deme in the suburbs of Athens was convenient for a man who frequented the city streets, so it seems likely that he continued to live in his ancestral home in Alopece.
When he was eighteen, Socrates was presented to the demarch or borough chairman as a candidate for citizenship. Since the city of Athens kept no vital records, family members and close acquaintances had to swear that he had reached his eighteenth birthday. They also had to swear that his father was a citizen. In the year that Socrates came of age, Pericles pushed through a bill that required that not only a man’s father, but also his mother must be Athenian in order to qualify for citizenship. Socrates must have met the more stringent requirement, for his name was duly entered in the deme’s register of youth eligible for citizenship.
After the deme certified Socrates and his age-mates, they sent the records to the Council, which conducted a review (dokimasia) to verify that the information was correct. After this last step, Socrates would have become a citizen and, therefore, eligible to participate in civic processes, except those with an age requirement. For instance, to hold some offices a citizen must have attained the age of thirty. Public records henceforth would certify his age and thus eligibility for office — and for military service.
Hereafter he was officially known by his “demotic” name, Socrates of Alopece, a designation meant to identify citizens with their boroughs more closely than with their families, so as to counteract the powerful influence of family groups (indicated by the patronymic, for instance, Socrates son of Sophroniscus) on the politics of the city.
Socrates now became a cadet or ephebe (ephēbos), subject to military training and assignment. In the fourth century, cadets received rigorous military training, performed in parades and exhibitions and served in garrisons around the city for two years. Spartan cadets had received rigorous military and survival training from an early time. It is not clear, however, how much formal training Socrates received in his time as a cadet in mid-fifth-century Athens. He may have served on garrison and patrol duty in the city and the borders of Attica but with little formal training.
Fortunately for Socrates, around 451 when he’d come of age, Cimon was invited to return early to Athens from his exile and negotiated a five-year truce with the Spartans whom the great statesman favored (see ch. 2.5*). Cimon then led an expedition to raid Persian territory in Egypt and Cyprus while Socrates was still serving at home as a cadet. About the time Socrates finished his two-year training, Cimon died and a treaty was negotiated with the Persian Empire, initiating a period of relative peace for several years.
As Socrates completed his military training, after having finished his brief formal education some years before, he succeeded at the age of twenty to the estate of an independent citizen in 449. He came of age just at the time when a thoroughgoing democracy was being instituted in Athens for the first time. Socrates would continue his education by participating in a government that called on the talents of all its citizens to carry out its business. As we shall see, Socrates never aimed at political leadership, but he could not escape holding offices or, in what was considered an equally political responsibility, participating in the armed services of Athens. He would serve bravely in the army and would, by chance or by fate, hold the very highest office in the government — for one day.
In Socrates’ time, Athens led the Greek world in drawing on the talents of all its citizens to govern the city. As Pericles would say some eighteen years later in his famous funeral oration, speaking of the comprehensive Athenian experience with excusable pride, “In summary, I declare that our whole city is the school of Greece.”

Welcome to Athens — a city where ancient history intertwines with modern life. Come along with me as I take you on a journey through this fascinating metropolis and share my thoughts on the emotions it evokes along with my flight and Airbnb costs to my trip to Athens, Greece.
Walking along the streets of Athens, one can sense its bustling energy and the aromatic smells emanating from its eateries. Amidst the savory scents and laughter of locals, I felt a strong sense of camaraderie and liveliness. Athens is the kind of city where every street corner seems to hide a culinary treasure, and every meal is an invitation to savor life’s simple pleasures.
As I wandered through the city center, I couldn’t help but feel disoriented by the maze of narrow alleys and busy squares. However, amidst the chaos, I sensed a constant undercurrent of contagious energy and enthusiasm. Athens has its own unique rhythm that encourages exploration and embracing every moment. The city’s vibe is invigorating and creates a desire to keep moving forward.
While Athens is known for its bustling urban life, it also offers moments of tranquility in its parks and green spaces. Being surrounded by nature, I experienced a deep sense of inner peace and contemplation. These green oases serve as a retreat from the city’s fast-paced lifestyle and a reminder of the importance of maintaining a harmonious balance between urbanization and the natural world.
Visiting the Acropolis was an awe-inspiring journey through time and history. As I ascended the ancient steps and stood before the Parthenon, I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of reverence and wonder. The sheer magnitude of this iconic monument and its enduring beauty left an indelible mark on my soul. Athens is a city that envelops you in its vibrant and ever-evolving embrace. It’s a place where you can’t help but feel alive, where the blend of history and modernity creates an electrifying tapestry of emotions.
I flew from Riga, Latvia, and the roundtrip flight cost to Athens was $300, and my Airbnb lodging was $300 for 4 nights. This article (and its video counterpart) has been a quick and simple overview of my time in Athens. Still, I will be creating in-depth and analytical videos on my time in Greece to help you make a better purchasing decision when it comes to planning your next European adventure, along with tips and tricks on maximizing your experience in the city of Athens.
My in-depth video on Greece is coming soon, so please stay tuned by subscribing to my YouTube channel, and if you want a sample of what my in-depth videos look like, watch the video below where I give my recommendations on Slovenia after my 30 day stay.

Hello there! My name is Nick Iakovidis and I live in Athens, since I was a baby. I would like to take you on a trip to my home like no other will ever take you! I’ll share with you the secrets of my city, that gave birth to Socrates and Plato, and guide you through her streets. So, prepare yourselves for a great adventure and walk with me in one of the oldest cities in Europe!
We start with the most famous neighborhood of Athens, Monastiraki.
Monastiraki is the heart of Athens. You can reach it either by bus, train or metro, so it is pretty easy to get there without getting lost. Once out of the train station, you will reach the “Monastiraki Square” which you can see in the photo below. It is always filled with people, locals, street artists, and tourists from every place on earth.
See that church in the left corner? This is the church of “Panagia Pantanassa” (“Mother Mary — Queen of the World”). It may seem insignificant, but it is in fact one of the oldest churches in Athens, built around the 10th century AD! It was originally part of a much larger monastery, which covered the entire square. When the monastery was destroyed during the 19th century, the church became known as “little Monastery” or “Monastiraki” in Greek, thus giving its name to the neighborhood! Look closely at its corners and you will spot parts of ancient Greek pillars, which were used for its building, proving how old it really is!
While the train station is a common meeting point with our friends, family, or dates, the locals don’t like spending much time here. There are plenty of routes to choose from and wander into the streets! Also, I would like to advise you not to fall into temptation and sit in one of the many roof gardens like “360"", “MS Roof Garden”, “Anglais”, and “Citizen”, neither have souvlaki at the restaurants found in Mitropoleos street, near the square! These places are tourist traps and overcharge everything.
Instead, take the Ifaistou street and go on a trip to the Flea Market of Athens, also known as “Yusurum”. Originally created by Jewish immigrants in 1863, this market is where you can find anything you ever wanted. Vinyls and CDs at “Zacharias”, rock, punk, and heavy metal accessories at “Full Moon”, leather sandals and silly t-shirts, lots of hippie clothes, cannabis products, and souvenirs. Whether you want to buy a mini-Parthenon or a cool-looking set of leather boots, this place will get you covered.
But if you want to dig really deep while in there, and find valuable treasures, unlike anything else, you need to go to “Abyssinia Square”, located at the end of Ifaistou. Named after the Africans from Ethiopia, who settled there during the Ottoman occupation, it is where numerous antique shops are located. Here you will find comic books, posters, memorabilia, collectibles, rings, and telephones, all coming from decades ago! Here, laying on wooden tables in front view you may find things like broken clocks, old musical instruments, even valuable coins from 100 years ago! It is the perfect place to find a unique gift to take back!
Extra tip: every Sunday there is a bazaar of antiques here, so don’t miss it!
Are you tired from your trip and need a drink?
Then spend your time in one of the many bars, hiding around the Flea Market! Unlike those found in the central square, here you will have a great time, enjoying your drink like a true Athenian!
Need a place where you can marvel at the Parthenon while drinking your favorite cocktail or coffee? Then, allow me to introduce you to “Couleur Locale”, or as it is known here, “one of the most beautiful terraces of the city”:
Beautiful, isn’t it? “Locale” opened in 2014 and since then, it has become a favorite place for university students to party. Be sure to check out its signature cocktails like “Gin Basil Smash”, “The Surfer” and “Sleep no More”, made with gin and unique Greek flavors, like mastic, basil, and lemon. So, take your friends and go have the party of your lives under the attic night sky!
Perhaps you prefer a more quiet approach! Like a small green garden inside an old neoclassical house! Well, then say no more, and knock on the wooden door of the building right next to “Locale”. Don’t be afraid, it is not abandoned! It is just camouflage!
This is “Taff: the Art Foundation”:
Yes, this is real. Yes, it is in Monastiraki, hidden in plain sight.
TAF opened its doors to the public in May 2009 and since then it remains one of the most active and creative organizations in the city. It hosts a variety of cultural events, like concerts, galleries, and art exhibitions, all made by local artists. If you seek an artistic, bohemian paradise, right in the heart of Athens, you’ve found it!
Still, want more?
Then, take out your phone and prepare to update your Instagram! It’s time to visit the most instagramable cafe in Monastiraki!
This is “Ellyz Cafe”
“Ellyz” resembles more a pink paradise, straight out from a Disney movie, rather than an actual place. Once inside, you will find yourself enjoying your brunch on a cozy couch, while hundreds of flowers are hanging over your head. Its menu could make even Willy Wonka himself green from envy! Try chocolate pink hearts, creamy lemon tarts with flowers, and tasty rose cheesecake, which will melt in your mouth! Coffee lovers don’t forget to try a pink cappucino or a fredo latte with a large pink donut on top!
Extra tip: make sure you go to Ellyz with a friend who knows to take great photos!
Of course, Monastiraki is a multicultural neighborhood. Besides the above cafes and bars, you will find exotic places to travel you in faraway lands. Don’t miss to check out “James Joyce Irish Pub” (which is a personal favorite) and enjoy a Guinness with juicy chicken wings, while watching sports on one of the many tv screens. Or how about a visit to exotic Cuba? Seek the “Buena Vista Social Bar” and have a Latin party on its vintage decorated terrace!
It is time to share with you one final secret. Go to the end of Adrianou Street and start walking towards the centrer. In front of you, you will see one of my favorite spots in Monastiraki. On your right lies the ancient Agora of Athens, covered in a green dress of trees and bushes. You might spot the temple of Ifaistos and the Stoa of Attalos, graciously standing above all the others. Perhaps you might hear the sound of trains arriving at the station.
On your left there are the numerous cafes and restaurants of Adrianou, always filled with people. You will see elders reading their newspapers while drinking ouzo, tourists laughing and carrying their luggage, children loudly playing on the street next to people, who are selling antiques. A young couple might pass next to you, enjoying ice cream while holding hands, or a company of college students, eager to plan their night party at one of the bars mentioned above. You will hear Greek, Russian, and English, all mixed together in multicultural harmony. Perhaps, if you are lucky enough, you will feel the light summer breeze of Athens cooling your face, as the sun makes its way down to the West.
This is Athens. This is Monastiraki!
A Crossroads of Civilizations!

“Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts and eloquence.” — John Milton
As our plane flew above Athens on our family’s first trip to Greece, the limited view from above only added to the excitement and wonder we were feeling.
As we looked out the window, we were able to see glimpses of the city’s charm. Clusters of rooftops gave us a peek into the vibrant neighborhoods below.
Although we couldn’t see all the finer details, the thrill of being above Athens, surrounded by its rich history and lively culture, only heightened our eagerness to explore the city in person.

Athens, Greece, the birthplace of democracy, the freddo espresso, and saganaki cheese (all that is good in this world), is also said to be the motherland of graffiti.
The origin of the word graffiti is derived from Greek “graphein,” meaning “to write,” “draw,” or “scratch.” But moreover, the practice, as we know it today; to take to the streets to paint or tag, allegedly started with a Greek national in the US whose practice caught on and then made its way back to the homeland.
The accuracy of this tale, I wasn’t able to validate, but it makes for a good story, and with Athens density of street art — floor to ceiling, wall to wall — you feel that this must be the source.
In 2017, I had the pleasure of calling this ancient city home; soaking in the sunshine, the food and, of course, the art! When it comes to documenting street art in the Greek capital, the greatest challenge is that there is simply too much to accurately map.
One street in Athens can house more great art than an entire city elsewhere. So, I have tried my hardest to do it justice. I have broken my map into the main artistic regions of Athens and pinned spots where there is a large density of art, or significant murals to check out.
Use the map as a guide, but keep your eyes peeled from place to place, there is gold everywhere on the streets of Athens.
When first arriving in Athens, I was lucky enough to call this area home. There is a young modern crowd here with oodles of bars, restaurants, and cafes to be found. And, on basically every street, you will find painted walls.
Artists featured: STMTS, exitonwall, Achilles, INO, and Dreky the Pirate. Follow them!
Psyri is possibly the hippest neighbourhood in Athens. Again, bars, restaurants, and cafes a-plenty and an even richer density of street art. There is one street — Sarri — where you can find epic pieces from almost every prominent artist in Athens.
Artist featured: Yiakou, Achilles, David Selor, Vasmou, and Hambas.
I fucking love Exarcheia. If you Google it, you will see lots of talk about anarchy and riots. That’s not why I love it, of course, but I love the vibe of people who are passionate about fighting against the system if it is not serving the people. As soon as you enter Exarcheia, you’re destined to see political graffiti, Antifa symbols, and expressions of rage, as well as an array of murals, posters, and paint.
Artists featured: Wild Drawing, Olga Mavrommati, MOTA, and STMTS.

“It takes a lifetime to discover Greece, but it only takes an instant to fall in love with her.” — Henry Miller
Starting my unforgettable journey through Greece, I’m excited to finally check it off my bucket list while diving into its stunning beauty and fascinating history.
Thanks to my travel agent’s help, who carefully put together a package including visits to Athens, Santorini, and Crete, along with accommodations and airport transfers, all I needed to do was book a flight.
I started my journey in Athens, a city that effortlessly blends ancient history with modern culture. As I walked through the streets of Plaka, I was captivated by the combination of ancient ruins and bustling cafes, which revealed the city’s rich history and culture at every corner.
During my stay in Athens, I visited the Parthenon atop the Acropolis, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. Standing beneath the ancient temple, I was awestruck by the sheer scale of its history and significance. The Parthenon’s towering columns and intricate carvings are a true testament to the brilliance and craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks.
To fully immerse myself in Athenian life, I chose to stay in the heart of downtown Athens. This allowed me to walk everywhere, making it easy to explore landmarks such as Syntagma Square, Monastiraki Flea Market, and the vibrant neighborhoods of Psiri and Exarchia. Being centrally located made me feel part of the city’s pulse, and I enjoyed soaking up the vibrant atmosphere that surrounded me.
“I want to have an ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ experience where I drop off the face of the planet and move to Greece.” — Jennifer Hyman
My journey then led me to Santorini, a destination that had long captured my imagination. As the ferry approached the island, I was greeted by a breathtaking panorama of white-washed buildings clinging to cliffs, adorned with blue-domed churches. The striking contrast between the pristine whitewashed architecture and the deep azure of the Aegean Sea was truly mesmerizing, creating a scene straight out of a postcard.
Exploring Enchanting Villages:
Stepping onto Santorini’s shores felt like entering a dream. I embarked on a journey to explore its enchanting villages, starting with the iconic Oia. Its narrow cobblestone streets led me on a whimsical journey, lined with charming cafes, boutique shops, and art galleries tucked away in every nook and cranny. The village’s crowning glory, however, was its unparalleled sunset views. Joining fellow travelers atop the cliffs of Oia, I witnessed nature’s masterpiece unfold as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of gold and crimson.
Continuing my exploration, I ventured to Fira, Santorini’s bustling capital perched atop the caldera cliffs. Here, I found a vibrant atmosphere pulsating through its labyrinthine streets. From chic boutiques to traditional tavernas, Fira offered a delightful blend of modernity and tradition. And no visit to Fira would be complete without a stroll along the cliffside promenade, where panoramic views of the caldera stretched out before me, offering a glimpse into the island’s volcanic past.
Embracing the Island’s Natural Beauty:
Santorini’s allure extends beyond its picturesque villages, beckoning travelers to immerse themselves in its natural wonders. I embarked on a trek along the caldera rim, traversing rugged terrain and ancient pathways carved into the cliffs. With each step, I was rewarded with sweeping vistas of the Aegean Sea and the neighboring islands, a reminder of the island’s volcanic origins.
Moreover, Santorini’s beaches are not to be missed. From the black sands of Perissa and Kamari to the red sands of Red Beach, each shoreline offered its own unique charm. I spent my days lounging on the sun-drenched shores, taking refreshing dips in the crystalline waters, and soaking in the Mediterranean sun.
A Word of Advice: Bring Comfortable Walking Shoes:
As I navigated Santorini’s enchanting landscapes, one thing became abundantly clear: comfortable walking shoes are an absolute must. Whether exploring the winding streets of its villages or trekking along the rugged coastline, sturdy footwear ensured that I could fully enjoy all that Santorini had to offer without any discomfort.
Finally, I set sail for Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, and a place of myth and legend. Exploring the Palace of Knossos, I felt like I was walking in the footsteps of ancient kings and heroes, with the echoes of the past reverberating through the labyrinthine ruins. I also took the time to unwind on Crete’s beautiful beaches with their crystal-clear waters and golden sands, which offered the perfect respite after days filled with exploration and discovery.
In conclusion, my Greek odyssey exceeded my wildest expectations, offering a tapestry of experiences that will remain in my memory for years to come. I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced Greece’s natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant culture. I know that Greece will always hold a special place in my heart, beckoning me back to its shores time and time again.
“There are two kinds of people. Greeks, and everyone else who wish they were Greek.” — My big fat Greek wedding

“Let there be light! Said Liberty, And like sunrise from the sea, Athens arose!” — Percy Bysshe Shelley
During our recent vacation in Athens in March 2023, my family and I made the decision to explore the charming pedestrianized streets that wind through the heart of the city.
Recognizing the golden chance it presented, I seized the moment to craft a photo essay destined to be shared with my dear readers.
A visit to Athens is essential to experience Greece fully, as it is regarded as one of Europe’s most iconic destinations. Often called the cradle of civilization, Athens showcases the rich history of Ancient Greece, highlighted by the magnificent Acropolis that dominates the city’s skyline.
Athens, renowned as the epicenter of the ancient world, offers present-day visitors an incredibly authentic and memorable glimpse into life from nearly…

“Earth proudly wears the Parthenon as the best gem upon her zone.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson
In May 2023, my family and I embarked on a memorable trip to Greece.
We had the incredible opportunity to explore the picturesque islands of Santorini and Mykonos. We saved the jewel of our adventure, Athens, for last.
There are direct flights from Athens to the United States, so we were able to spend a few nights in this historic city before returning to the US.
Athens is renowned for its renowned ancient remains and iconic architectural landmarks. It holds the esteemed title of being the birthplace of democracy and the cradle of European civilization.
Athens is also home to the Acropolis, which represents the earliest form of a modern society in Europe. One of the highlights of our Athens visit was our tour of the Acropolis.
Contrary to common misconception, the term ‘Acropolis’ does not specifically denote the temple situated atop the hill. Instead, it encompasses the entire hill, with the well-known temple at its summit being the…

Entry 150. Athens, GreeceThursday, April 20
After some seriously rocky adventures on Kefalonia, I was kind of looking forward to heading back to big-city civilisation. The Greek islands have great potential but they can be quite hard work, especially so if you visit outside of high season.
To be honest I felt the least welcome of any place on my travels whilst being in these islands because of grumpy locals, over-priced food and accommodation, difficulty in getting places and the slapstick level of service.
Maybe it’s a Greek thing, maybe it’s just that they’re sick of tourists because we’ve been coming here for thousands of years. Whatever. All that has resulted in collective fatigue which means I’m in less than an optimum condition to write this entry about Athens, which needs to cover many weird, wonderful and important things. I hope I do it justice, so please bear with me.

People are always surprised when I say that I live in Greece. To tell the truth I have never imagined that I was going to live here… and neither when I initially came to spend 3 months was I planning to stay for that long. Three years and a half have passed and here I am. Before getting to know Athens and Greece I didn’t have an image in my mind of what I was going to find here, and in different ways and little by little the city and the country have conquered me. Today I can say much more than 10 reasons to live here, but I will just give you a taste.
1-Weather
Greece is in fact a blessed country for the weather that it has. The only thing that I would change would be to add some humidity in the air, since sometimes it is so dry that it causes irritations. Other than that, the seasons are very well defined and never reach extremes. Of course in the North it is more cold during the winter, and in mountainous areas. In Athens, the winter hardly has temperatures below zero, normally it is between 10 and 20 degrees until April, May, and then it starts to rise. It snows mostly three times during the winter, and normally it does not accumulate on the ground. During summer, the temperature can reach more than 35 degrees, especially in July and August. My favorite seasons are spring and fall, both with pleasant temperatures, although during fall it rains a bit more. Still, in general it rains quite little in Athens (in the summer we spend three months with the sun shining intensively).
2-Islands
Who has never dreamed of visiting the famous Greek islands? Or spending the honeymoon around here? As a matter of fact, the islands are one of the most incredible reasons to live in this country. And Athens is in advantage because it has the biggest ports and it is quite close from some of these paradises. It is very curious to talk about trips with Greeks, although many of them have never visited some of their neighbor countries, every summer they go to two or three different islands and they love to talk about what each one has that is special, and to compare them. In three years, I could already know some of these enchanting places, and each year choosing becomes more difficult, as the more you listen about the places, the more you want to visit them.
3-Safety
Ok, Greece is no Denmark, and organization is not Greek’s favorite word, neither it is law. But one thing that is very respected around here, is the space and freedom of each individual. Theft is common, as also in every other corner in Europe, but here we can walk the streets at dawn without worrying if we will manage to come back home safely. Athens, being a big city and with more than three million inhabitants, might not be the best example in safety of the country, nevertheless it is rare to hear about murders or general violence against people in the streets, and even the protests during the crisis are somehow pacific.
4-Food
Unmissable! Just with this word you can have an idea of the Greek cuisine. In the last three years I have gained some kilos (and I don’t complain because I was skinny before), something that in 25 years of life I have never achieved, regardless the place I was living. Yes, the food is delicious, and there is great variety. In Athens, besides thousands of taverns, you can find Mexican restaurants, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Russian and so on. From Greek food, features the olive oil, the olives, feta cheese and the famous souvlaki (the Greek acarajé, as I usually compare, with this delicious dish from Bahia).
5-Nightlife
Again the weather here helps a lot. There is nothing like a bad winter that makes the Greeks stay at home instead of enjoying the night. Either for dinner (normally after 9pm) or drinks at some bar, or a club, the Greek nightlife is very exciting. Athens has different neighborhoods that concentrate these clubs for different tastes, and the best thing is that it costs nothing to enter these parties. You only pay what you drink. For the typical Greek clubs, the parties called buzukia, you pay a more expensive entrance, but it includes food and drinks. And the night never ends, you only come back before 3am if you want to.
6-People similar to Brazilians
Greeks are very different from the typical European from the North. Besides being Mediterranean, they have mixed up with Turkish, and this mix has given origin to a joyful and lively people. They love gathering to eat and talk, spending hours sitting at the table after a meal. Besides that, normally they are friendly with strangers, maybe in Athens a bit less since it is a big city. They are also passionate about music and arts in general. The only thing that I miss about the joyful Greek life style is the dance. They don’t do it like Brazilians. Although they get excited with the typical Greek dance, they are usually not moving so much at parties and clubs.
7-Peaceful life
Even though Athens is the capital of the country, it has this air of a small town. Despite having great movement and quite a hectic nightlife, busier than other European capitals, you can easily find quiet neighborhoods in the suburban areas, like small villages. Having an older population contributes a lot to that.
8-Prices and courtesies
Greece is not a cheap country, but comparing to others in Europe the cost of life is interesting. You can buy a bottle of water with less than 50 cents of Euro. And to have a nice meal here can cost between 5 and 10 euros. Besides, it is very common at restaurants to offer free water and sometimes free dessert. Apartment rentals are also cheap comparing to capitals like Paris, and even cities in Brazil, like São Paulo and Rio, and, in general, there are not big social differences. I know, for instance, people working as maid at hotels and living in a very good apartment in a noble area of the city.
9-Cafes
Athens has cafes in every corner of the city. And it is a Greek habit to go out to have coffee and chill at any moment of the day. Their happy hour is much more connected to coffee than to beer as in Brazil. OK, to me, since I am not a big fan of coffee this could be a disadvantage somehow, but most Brazilians would certainly enjoy this routine a lot.
10-Culture/History
Who does not know that Greece is one of the richest countries historically and culturally speaking and that a lot of what we inherited as western civilization come from here? Even words from Portuguese have origin in the Greek language, and they are a lot! It is amazing to go around Athens and to visit the ruins and monuments, and at any place that you go to visit in the country, you will certainly find a piece of this history.

Here’s what you need to know if you’re thinking about taking on a real bucket-list marathon race and running the original, Athens Authentic Marathon!
A year later than initially planned, I got to run the 38th Athens Authentic Marathon. It’s known as the ‘Authentic Marathon’ as it follows the fabled route of Greek messenger Philippides, who ran to the town of Marathon and back to Athens to bring news of a Greek battle victory against Persia, dying after he’d relayed the news.
Gladly, I only ran this route one-way and I’m still alive to tell the tale, so if you’re thinking about running the Athens Authentic Marathon in the future, here’s what you can expect.
You’ll discover to expect at the expo, how the race unfolds on the day and an overview my own race strategy that brought me a new personal best and my first ever time qualifier result.
But first, let’s get started by looking at the pre-race organisation.
The first thing you’ll notice when you start to check-out the information online about the Athens Authentic Marathon is that the quality is rather poor.
The Athens Authentic Marathon website is dated and doesn’t work well on mobile. The content is also usually out of date, with information about previous runnings easily available but little to nothing about the upcoming event. It also doesn’t help that there are several other events that share the same website, so you’ll frequently find information about the half marathon, 10k and 5k races taking place around the same time as the marathon.
It’s rather frustrating.
The social media accounts aren’t much better. They’re basically dormant until a few weeks before the race, then burst into action covering all the ribbon-cutting, permit-acquiring activities runners really couldn’t care less about. Like the website, the socials were also extremely poor.
But, on the day of the Athens Authentic Marathon itself, the organisation was perfect.
I took one of the coaches to Marathon departing from Syntagma and had zero problems. There must’ve been 20–30 coaches lined up, and when the front coach was full (or full-ish) it pulled away.
After arriving at the starting point in Marathon, it was a short walk to the stadium and a 90-minute wait until the race got underway. So as on-the-day organisation goes, there was zero anxiety. It’s just a shame that level of organisation and reassurance wasn’t present on the website and socials in the build up to the race.
This was the first Athens Authentic Marathon since COVID-19 struck so unsurprisingly there were changes from previous runnings and additional protocols in place.
At the time of running, Greece was experiencing a surge in COVID-19 case numbers so everywhere you went shops and restaurants were very hot on mask-wearing and COVID-19 certificates to prove you’re either fully vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 or have a recent negative COVID-19 test (even to the extent of having to show a vaccine certificate and wear a mask to enter a cheap souvenir store!). At the marathon expo, you had to show your vaccine status (or other acceptable status) to enter, and you had to wear a mask while you were inside.
Masks had to be worn on the coach from Athens to Marathon on the day of the race, and the coaches left sufficient room for social distancing by departing when they were probably around 60% full.
Marathon Stadium is all open air, so there was no need to wear masks while you were there, and this year there was a staggered start over two ‘races’ and eight waves, which gave space between blocks of runners. That said, the start wave had zero social distancing and even with the best attempts of the marshals, not everyone maintained a safe distance while waiting for the starting pistol…
And speaking of waves, each wave set off about three minutes after the previous one, so as I was in Wave 3, I was over the start line by about 09:06.
I was running with a friend who was much faster than me and he was placed in Wave 1. There was a lot of very strict communication about not being able to change waves, but we managed to get it sorted at the expo so he could start with me in Wave 3. Apparently, your timing chip was calibrated to activate according to your wave start time, so, if you started in a different wave, your time wouldn’t be recorded.
Overall, the COVID-19 arrangements felt safe and proportionate and in line with what everyone else was doing in Greece at the time.
The Athens Marathon expo — known as the Ergo Marathon Expo — is located at the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre (previously known at the Taekwondo Centre). It’s south of the city on the coast and makes for a nice day out to watch the sailing after you’ve collected your bib.
As the expo was a straight line walk from our apartment, we decided to take an easy stroll to the exhibition centre, which was about 4km away and all downhill. It was a lovely walk and excellent weather, but when we saw the Faliro Indoor Hall & Exhibition Centre we literally ran out of road — several busy motorways and lots of excavation sat between us and the expo hall with no obvious way of crossing them.
We ran into a group of Greek guys who were also on their way there, but even they didn’t know which way to go! After about a kilometre detour, we eventually ended up on the correct side of the motorways and got into the expo after showing our vaccine certificates.
Picking up our race packs was quick and easy, you just had to show your confirmation email and photographic ID. We also managed to sort running in the same wave together, which was also very easy. My friend had the back of his bib signed and stamped to show he’d been approved to run in a different wave, while his registration was updated as well so that his timing chip would work in Wave 3.
The expo offerings were pretty good, with two floors of stalls and very well attended, even if the official marathon stall was pretty small (about 30sq m) and running low on stocks of small and medium merchandise.
We spent around 45 minutes at the expo, which was enough, then grabbed some lunch before heading back into the City Centre.
On race day, it was a fairly early start as the coaches to Marathon began leaving from various points throughout Athens at 05:30, with the last coach scheduled to depart around 06:15. There were dozens of coaches lined up near Syntagma where we boarded our coach, so it was very quick and easy to get on the transport.
And even though it was before sunrise on a Sunday, the Greek parliament guards were still doing their routines, and with only a handful of runners around it was an excellent opportunity to take photos or a short video!
On the coach, there was an information tape playing, explaining in Greek and English what to expect, as well as giving a little history behind the race. So by the time you reached Marathon about 45 minute later, you’re fully briefed and raring to go.
Marathon Stadium is the ‘start village’ for the race and is virtually all outdoors. There is a small indoor area at the back, but unless you were queuing for toilets you were ‘strongly advised’ to go outside (COVID, and everything…).
The stadium itself is a bit run down but there was plenty of room, and if you arrived early enough, you could get a cheeky Strava Segment in round the running track.
There were dozens of toilets and portaloos everywhere round the stadium, so you never had to queue long for the toilet (although some did… while others decided to go al fresco…). Free water and bananas were available so you could keep fluid and carb levels topped up.
The Olympic Flame is also at Marathon Stadium, and if you time it right you can go and hold the torch. Unfortunately, we were in our start pen by then so could only look on in envy.
Running the Athens Marathon requires planning for three very different sections, which I’ll refer to as the First Half, the Hill and the End Bit. While it frustrated me a lot planning my race strategy, as conventional wisdom is to run even or negative splits that just aren’t feasible on this course, it made for a very exciting race in the end.
And don’t read the map left-to-right like a lot of people mistakenly do — the route starts in the east and heads south then west into Athens, not the other way round!
The Athens Authentic Marathon has one of the highest elevation gains of any major international marathon, with a total of 332m (1,089ft) elevation gain across its 26.2 miles. Most of that elevation gain comes in a brutal 8-mile section that begins about halfway through the race and continues relentlessly until you pass kilometre marker 31 (about 19.5 miles in).
But the good news is that the rest of the race — the End Bit — is virtually all downhill, including one of the most charitable last 800m I’ve ever experienced at a race.
After the 5km mark there are water stations every 2.5km in line with international race standards, as well as frequent toilet stops and aid stations. So from a provisions perspective, it was extremely well appointed.
The first half of the Athens Authentic Marathon is pretty much flat. There are a couple of minor climbs, but these only last for a few hundred metres, so they can be safely taken at a constant pace.
After leaving Marathon Stadium the route is fairly straight, save for a dog-legged detour about 5km around the Marathon Tomb. On the wide-open road — made less congested by the staggered start waves — it was easy to find a comfortable pace and lock it in, following the blue racing line as closely as I could.
I even made a friend during this section, getting to chat to a Greek guy who was aiming for a similar finish time to me. So it was nice to be able to chat while grinding down the miles.
The support through this section is sporadic as the setting is quite rural, but when you run through a village there’s a massive surge in energy as the whole place seemed to be out supporting the runners. There were also children and ladies handing out olive twigs for luck, so I took a small one and stuffed it into my pocket. It was a unique souvenir for a finish line selfie!
About halfway, The Hill starts. I clocked it starting at 13.5 miles, and it went on for the next 8 miles with only a couple of short sections flattening out a little.
I was nervous about The Hill, even though I’d trained on a lot of hills back home and had simulated an 8-mile, 180m (580ft) elevation gain run a few weeks earlier. But I’d never attempted something like this after running a fairly pacy (for me!) half marathon beforehand.
My coach had recommended I do ‘something’ while running up the hill to take my mind off it. ‘Counting to four’ and ‘pretending to click pens with my thumbs’ were two techniques he suggested had been shown to take the mind off pain, so I planned to give them a go. The ‘count to four’ suggestion fit well with a breathing technique Jack Daniels, PhD recommends of using two strides to breathe out and a two strides to breathe in.
So I applied the ‘count to four’ and breathing technique for a good part of The Hill, but also took the opportunity to learn a bit of Greek from my Greek running friend. I learned how to say ‘thank you’ (‘Efharisto’ or Ευχαριστώ) and tried it out on the crowds, with him correcting my terrible pronunciation so I could try again later.
I think I got it in the end!
For all the worry I had about The Hill beforehand, it turned out to be absolutely manageable. My highest elevation gain over one mile was 138ft (42m), but most miles had an elevation gain of just 50–60ft (15–18m).
My race strategy worked a treat through this section and I was actually ahead of schedule by the time The Hill ended at kilometre marker 31… but not before the most brutal segment, where you run down — and then back up — a motorway fly-under, which was a killer. But once you’re over the top, the road bends to the left and you can see it’s all downhill from now on.
At this point in the race, more than 20 miles in and knowing the hardest part was probably over, it was a bizarre feeling. But I’d had some sage advice from people who’d ran the Athens Authentic Marathon before, who told me:
Don’t put your foot down too quickly after the top of The Hill as many people who do this end up collapsing
After running uphill for so many miles, the sudden change in terrain puts a strain on different muscle groups as you head downhill, and for many people their knees just give way, and they collapse. After running so closely to my race plan up until this point, the last thing I wanted was to put my foot down too hard and fall over, so I gave it half a mile or so before increasing my pace.
The End Bit isn’t all downhill, there are flat sections and a sneaky incline just before the final turn, but the support really ramps up to cheer you on. Entering Athens was an incredible buzz, with massive support either side of the course and a lot more cheer stations as well.
And after that last turn, it’s another downhill segment straight into the Panathenaic Stadium and finish line. This must be one of the most charitable ends to any race I’ve ever ran as you can give it all you’ve got left without worrying about making it up another hill or round a tight bend.
It was fantastic!
And ending in the Panathenaic Stadium — location of the first Modern Olympic Games in 1896 — really is something to behold. And you’ll want your best smile/ grimace on as you enter the stadium as the finish straight is littered with photographers snapping away at your sprint finish.
Then it’s time to grab your medal — the 38th running has a fabulous double-sided medallion with Philippides on one side and the Panathenaic Stadium track on the other.
I can honestly say this race is up there with the very best, a cracking course and an exceptional finish line. I’d do it again without hesitation!
Coming back to my race strategy, I’d pondered it for months as The Hill means you must adapt your race plan from what would be considered ‘best practice’. Running even splits isn’t possible on this course as the elevation changes so vastly, while keeping your powder dry for later in the race seems like a waste considering the first half is flat as a pancake and you’ve got the benefit of miles of downhill segments at the end to sweep you through to the finish line.
My target was a Chicago Marathon time qualifier time, so I needed to come in sub-3:20.
I’d also ran a PB in a virtual marathon the previous year in 3:18, so my goals for Athens were to nail a Chicago Marathon time qualifier spot and, if possible, chalk up a new personal best. This meant my goal pace was about 7:34 mins/ mile over the marathon distance, but even splits were out of the question due to the 180m (560ft) of elevation on the 8-mile stretch of The Hill.
I didn’t know how much The Hill was going to take out of me, so I set a pace range for the last 5–6 miles, knowing if I was in that ballpark I’d hit my goal.
My race strategy looked like this:
· First Half: 7:00 mins/ mile
· The Hill: 7:30 to 7:45 mins/ mile
· The End Bit: whatever I had left in the tank, but as close to 7:00 mins/ mile as I could manage
This left quite a bit of wiggle room at the end as I knew I’d tire but didn’t know by how much.
The First Half went 100% to plan, I maintained a steady 7:00 mins/ mile throughout (even having to pull back my pacer friend at times to stop me from running too fast!) and hit The Hill bang on target.
To my utter amazement, The Hill turned out to be a lot kinder than I’d anticipated. I managed to hold a 7:20 mins/ mile pace for large portions of it, slowing only to 7:45 mins/ mile for the really steep sections, which were thankfully few and far between.
And for the End Bit, I managed to pull back to 7:00 mins/ mile for a couple of miles before fatigue set in and I dropped back to 7:30 mins/ mile. But hitting that last 800m downhill home stretch I accelerated to 6:45 mins/ mile to cross the finish line, which shows you just how charitable that last segment is!
I finished in a time of 3:08:31, way ahead of both my goals. My time was also a Boston Qualifier time and would’ve got me into the 2022 running but unfortunately the Athens Authentic Marathon was 48 hours after the close of the Boston Marathon qualifying period.
But there’s always another chance to improve my time and get that BQ next year!
I can honestly say this was one of the best races I’ve ever experienced. The course was incredible, gave you lots to think about and was an energising mix of quieter segments followed by raucous support as you ran through the towns and villages — and then Athens itself.
If this race is on your bucket list, I’d highly recommend signing up and living your dream.
You won’t be disappointed!

Airbnb has effectively created a new category of rental housing. This new category — called ‘short-term rentals’ — exemplifies a software-driven, platform-mediated market that occupies the gap between traditional residential rental housing and hotel accommodation.
A prime example of the corporate sharing economy, the American company operates an online marketplace and — with nearly 5 million listings in 81,000 cities and over 300 million check-ins — it has established itself as the world’s largest peer-to-peer hospitality intermediary. Guests benefit from the ease of use, decent rates, access to peer reviews, and a variety of housing options in neighborhoods not traditionally geared to tourism. Hosts benefit from the access to a huge audience, flexible living arrangements, and a steady flow of extra income in these times of economic crisis.
Nonetheless, Airbnb’s impact on cities and housing markets is not immediately obvious.
On the positive side, the company claims that the short-term rental market increases tourism and its economic benefits. It also provides additional income for hosts, particularly those who would not otherwise rent out their housing unit or rooms to longer term tenants, while benefiting neighborhoods that tourists traditionally do not visit, bringing additional customers to local businesses.
On the negative side, local communities and housing advocates point out that Airbnb is making it easier to illegally rent out apartment units to tourists, while taking those units off the market for full-time residents and driving housing costs higher, negatively affecting the quality of life in residential areas.
Accordingly, hotel associations are concerned that short-term rentals function as hotels but have an unfair advantage because they don’t pay taxes and violate safety and zoning regulations.
Attempts to regulate Airbnb, however, have encountered a significant pushback from the company, which summons a powerful weapon through disruptive business and lobbying strategies and by mobilising its community to protest proposed reforms and expand its political influence. While Airbnb and its defenders insist that these reforms must be updated to accommodate the new possibilities presented by the sharing economy, its opponents argue that Airbnb aims to avoid regulation and taxation, and threatens affordable housing in cities.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, was founded in 2008 as a way for people to easily list and rent out their spare rooms or their homes online. There has been a widespread concern, however, that a large amount of the activity on Airbnb is not ‘home sharing’, but rather a new form of de facto hotel that fuels gentrification and displacement.
In response to this concern, I set out to find how Airbnb is really being used in and affecting the Greek capital.
To understand the impact of Airbnb on housing in Athens, I downloaded and analysed a dataset compiled by the independent, non-commercial monitoring service Inside Airbnb, which tracks the flow of ads on the online platform.
The data covers the city centre of the Athens urban area, the largest in Greece and one of the most populated urban areas in Europe, sprawling across the central plain of Attica. The study period is May 26, 2009 — May 9, 2017, and every Airbnb listing which existed at any point in this period in the city centre of the Athens urban area has been included in the analysis.
In 2017, there were 5,127 listings reserved at least once on Airbnb in Athens — a 6.8% increase from the previous year (4,801 listings), and a 56.5% increase from 2015 (3,275 listings).
It is not the case that there are 5,127 listings receiving reservations, but rather the fact is that, on average, half of the listings available in Athens in a given month receive at least one review from a guest.
Serving as the glue of the community, reviews can be used as an indicator of Airbnb activity. This metric lets hosts or guests to leave a detailed review of their experience. Receiving a positive review from a guest is absolutely vital for a host to have more reservations and they usually encourage guests to leave a review. According to Niels van Doorn, Assistant Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam and Principal Investigator of the Platform Labor research project, “such ratings have become a major decentralized and scalable management technique that outsources quality control to customers of on-demand platforms, creating a generalized audit culture in which service providers are continually pushed to self-optimize and cater to the customer’s every whim.”
Indeed, serious Airbnb entrepreneurs may well refurbish their units to increase their success with the service. But still, the only necessary step for converting a long-term rental to a short-term one and for scoring quick money through Airbnb is just to evict the existing tenants, or not replace them when they depart.
Before proceeding, let’s remind ourselves that helping each other out by sharing our rooms or houses is one thing while commodifying them by charging a fee for their use is quite another. And this leads us to the more innovative aspect of the sharing economy, which is to disturb our material reality; according to author and critic Sebastian Olma, “to coordinate supply and demand of products and services that in their present form were previously unavailable on the market;” in our case, to allow people to sublet their houses.
It seems quite obvious, then, that, despite Airbnb’s outreach focus on small scale and occasional uses of its platform (the way, for example, that homeowners can pay their household regular expenses by hosting guests occasionally), most regulatory scrutiny of short-term rentals has been focused on entire homes or apartments. Of course, this scrutiny is not just limited to the room types in a given area — especially when it comes to Athens, where most of the listings are entire homes or apartments — but it is also extended to a listing’s availability and activity.
An Airbnb host can setup a calendar for their listing so that it is only available for a few days or weeks a year, while other listings are available all year round. Depending on its availability and activity, a home converted to full-time Airbnb use could be more like a hotel, disruptive for neighbors, taking away housing, and thereby fuelling gentrification across the city.
Yes, 91.6% of the Airbnb listings in Athens are available for more than 60 days a year. Keep in mind that the calculation of availability for each listing through insideairbnb.com tracks whether a listing is reported as available or unavailable on its calendar. This approach does not differentiate booked from unavailable properties, which means that the statistics could have underestimated the availability of properties.
Short-term rentals may also impact the housing shortage in Athens by offering a more lucrative alternative or a more flexible living arrangement to listing a unit on the long-term rental market.
With an average price of €55 per night across Athens, it would not be a hustle for some landlords to evict a tenant for the financial benefits of entering the sharing economy, right? The essence of sharing, however, does not involve the exchange of money. Again, sharing only happens in the absence of market transactions.
This is why the image of a family occasionally renting a spare room in their home, or perhaps renting their entire home for a brief period of time while they are out of town, is not representative of Athens anymore (as if it ever was).
But how can we distinguish commercial from occasional operators?
One way to do this is to look at hosts who have multiple listings on Airbnb. By definition a commercial operator is a host with more than one entire home listing, since only one of their listings could be their primary residence.
Estimating commercial operators this way will dramatically underestimate their numbers, since it will fail to identify hosts who have a single listing which is not their primary residence and which they run as a business. It will also fail to identify hosts who operate their listings via multiple Airbnb accounts. It is a useful first approximation though.
A ‘multi-listing’ is, thus, defined as an entire-home listing whose host has at least one other entire-home listing, or a private-room listing whose host has at least two other private-room listings.
Commercial operators that control multiple entire-home/apartment listings or large portfolios of private rooms are a 43.8% of hosts in Athens.
Here’s the top 10 of them for 2017:
Most discussion of Airbnb’s impact on housing availability and affordability focuses on entire-home listings and for good reason. These are the listings which, if rented sufficiently often throughout the year, can no longer be housing a long-term tenant. Private room listings, by contrast, are generally assumed to have little if any impact on housing markets, since they generally do not displace renters.
If we look at groupings of private rooms rented by a single host in the same building, or in what the Canadian housing advocacy group Fairbnb has called ‘ghost hotel’, this assumption is clearly false.
Most ghost hotels in Athens comprise 2 to 5 private-room listings. The most striking fact about Athens’ ghost hotels, apart from simply their existence, is that one of them has 40 private-room listings and that it is a real hotel.
Among others, ghost hotels in Athens include:
I have noticed that when there is a discussion involving affordable housing and Airbnb in Athens, someone will come forward and reference Koukaki as the #1 exclusive AirBnB zone in the city. Almost true, given the small size of the area.
Following the neighborhoods of Plaka and Exarchia, Koukaki ranks third on the Airbnb chart of Athens with 343 listings, and fifth on Airbnb’s top 16 neighborhoods to visit in 2016, with 801% growth from 2015.
FYI: at the time of this writing, there are only 65 apartments available in Koukaki on www.xe.gr, the leading long-term rental platform in Greece.
As you might wonder, ‘#1 Event Venue In Athens | Acropolis View 360°!!!’ is the reason why Kerameikos is the most expensive neighborhood in Athens.
With an average price of €85 per night, Plaka ranks as the #2 most expensive neighborohood in the short-term rental market of Athens, followed by Pentagono, Rigillis, and Zappeion with €81, €75, and €74 per night respectively. I was hoping to see Kolonaki in the top 5, but it’s just #6 with €72,4 per night on average.
Taking those metrics one step further, the map below illustrates the distribution of all 5,127 Airbnb listings in the city centre of the Athens on May 9, 2017. Each circle represents a listing. The size of the circle is the listing’s price per night, and the colour is the room type.
Lastly, let’s take a closer look at the 5 neighborhoods with the greatest concentration of Airbnb listings in Athens.
Hopefully this data adds a bit more evidence to the discussion around the dominance of Airbnb in Athens and how it has become a symbol for quick value extraction. Now, the question is: How can we make the transition from a corporate consumer-driven to a citizen-centric sharing economy?
I’d love to hear your examples of non-profit, community-based alternatives and how they support forms of exchange that could actually be called sharing.
Notes on methodology
I initially became interested in exploring the dominance of Airbnb in Athens after discovering Inside Airbnb’s dataset, and settled on this methodology after coming across UPGO’s analysis of Airbnb in New York zip codes.
Once I isolated the names of each neighborhood in Athens, I queried the dataset to search each neighborhood for available Airbnb listings (focusing on the three available room types), their hosts, availability, and price/night, among others. Using the lat/long coordinates for each listing, I mapped each listing to its neighborhood. All code is written in Python.

“What is the city but its people?”
Choosing a travel destination is always hard. There are in the world so many places to explore and to make yours, that the choise can be even hard to explain when you say to people: “I am leaving for X-city and I will stay there for Y-days”.It is even more difficult to define, once we come back from our journey, what really fascinated and attracted us during our time spent away from home, what actually hit our eyes and heart.
My wanderlust brought me to pick the capital city of Greece for my end of May’s trip, as I wanted to follow the roots of wise men I studied during my school years such as Heracitus, Herodotus, Pisistratos, Pericles, Homer, Socrates, Aristotle and many others, and to discover the origins of the modern western civilation and democracy set by the Greeks around the V century BC. And indeed the mission was accomplished.
There are many things we discuss with with our friends and relatives once we come back from a journey. The most common topics concern sightseeings, architecture, landscapes, food, activities, hotel,… All aspects related to how the place we have been has met our expectations and likes. The magic of a city, according to me, has a lot to do with the people we meet on our journey. It is indeed in this aspect that I found the city extremely attractive and fascinated, i.e. how people live their lives in the city, how much they contribute to give a special vibe and influence to their city life and how much they care about your personal opinion about their city. Even if we do not know anybody in the city we travel to, people seem to be the first attraction: how they behave, how they live, how and what they eat, what traditions they may have; all these points make the inhabitant of the city we visit special, as people give a place athmosphere, energy, identity and spirit.
I had the chance to meet spontaneosly several locals throughout my cityscape. People were spontaneously approaching me while I used to sit in bars in Plaka drinking coffee and writing my travel diary; some were even greeting me on the streets with a very warm “Kalimera”, some others were interested in knowing where I was from, what I was writing on my open diary, why I decided to visit their city,…
But even before flying to Athens, I got in touch with Alexander, a very friendly Athenian guy graduated in archeology and member of an association called “This is my Athens”. The following association does not only give tips to tourists about activities to do in Athens day and night, but provides also the chance to meet local people willing to show with their own eyes the city by bringing you around for an entire day for free.
Alexander was the greatest person I met during my trip. He did not only show me the Acropolis, Plaka, the Arch of Adrian, Syntagma Square and other highlights of Athens; he did not only brush up my previous knowledges of ancient Greek history, art, philosophy and culture, but he also showed me what he likes the most of his city: the encounter between ancient and modern, between the ancient myth and the need of modernisation and creativity Athens is experiencing today. The contrast of this gathering between ancient and modern is remarkable in Athens. It would normally disturb my outward eye while looking at the landscape. On the contrary, the day I climbed Lofos Filopappou, the Hill of the Muses, I felt a shiver of inspiration and beauty pervading my chest that I had to sit on a stone to write as follows:
“… The encounter between the Ancient and the Modern makes this city epic, as if myth, philosophy, comedy and tragedies are still echoeing in a neverending ballad with people in T-shirt filming the whole play with smartphones”.
Athens is mythical. Athens is legendary in every corner you explore. Myth and legend are witnessed not only by the majestity of the Acropolis itself, but also in its every corner by temples, columns in marble, arches and statues of ancient times. These remind all travellers of the epic past of the Greek civilazation, an unforgettable wise society who gave us the seeds and branches to create a common cultural base.
But people make Athens unically magical with they our spontaneity, with their own happiness which pervades you whenever you walk, whenever you sit at a café to drink the typical “Espresso Freddo” (cold espresso with foam). Every tourist can witness such in Plaka neighbourhood, a happy island located in the heart of Athens, where serenity and love for live take over the chaotic vibes of the centre of the city. In Plaka Athenians turn Athens at its best by chilling on the stairs drinking and chatting with friends, or even with strangers as it happened to me almost everday. In Plaka, the wonder of the place may turn your Athens experience into an unforgettable experience thanks to the athmosphere people have the power to create. As William Shakespeare once wrote: “What is the city but its people?”. If thanks to people we are all able to establish a connection between the city and its inner deep soul, the answer to the following Shakespearean quote might be “nothing!”, as the magic of the place cannot be separated from the soul of its people.

STAY. If you are a young and easy lonely traveller like me, looking for the cheapest but best location in every town, I can recommend “Pella In Hostel” , a great place where to find other backpackers and a great place where to chill from 7pm on the roofterrace which gives you a great view on the Acropolis, especially at sunset. WiFi available. No breakfast or meals. Bed available at average price of 16,- EUR/night https://www.facebook.com/Pella-Inn-145570978875281/
EATING AND DRINKING OUT. In Athens travellers find a huge and never ending varieties of restaurants and café offering typical amd exquisite Greek food. Here a selection of the best places I tried.
Melina Café, a café dedicated to Melina Mercouri, a world-famous Greek actress, active in the resistance movement against the military regime which ruled over Greece from 1967 until 1974. The café is situated on one of the many streets of Plaka Neighbourhood and offers a good selection of typical Greek food and beverages. Here I recommend the typical Espresso Freddo and a snack. WiFi available. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Melina-Cafe/202235353129523?ref=ts&fref=ts
Dodos Archaias Agora, Nice restaurant located almost in the middle of a huge row of other bars and restaurants on Agiou Filippou. I went there on the first nicht in Athens with two Italin girls I met in the first evening at the hostel. Great food, Retsina wine was excellent and the waiters were all very kind, with a great sense of warm hospitality. Here you can get a good meal with wine for 15,- EUR per person.

Yasemi Café Bistrot. According to my personal experience, this is the place where you can enjoy the unique life of Plaka district. While spending your time at Yasemi you can decide whether to sit at the standard tables or on a pillow on the stairs, as the tradition of Plaka wants. Yasemi offers a good selection of warm and refreshing beverages, from coffees and teas to beer and Greek wine and a good choice of snacks and easy Greek specialities to bite after a long walk around the Acropolis or just around the city. In few words, the best place to experience the true chilling Greek life. WiFi available. http://www.yiasemi.gr/

This is the next installment on my trip report from my February trip to Athens and Israel, experiencing the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens. If you are just joining, catch up on how I planned and booked the trip and prior reviews of the Emirates business class flight from Newark to Athens and the ground experience and the SAS Lounge at Newark.
The InterContinental Athenaeum Athens is located in the Neos Kosmos neighborhood of Athens, just off the Syggrou highway. The immediate area feels a bit run down and there was a variety of businesses and old buildings. My impression is that most of the guests were attending meetings and events at the hotel’s conference center.
The hotel has over 500 rooms and suites, and several restaurants and bars. There is also a pool and extensive conference facilities.
I booked the hotel for 24,000 points a night using points earned from the welcome bonus on my IHG Rewards Premier Credit Card. IHG One Rewards are a fairly easy currency to get and are a 1:1 transfer partner from Chase Ultimate Rewards.
stayed for just 3 nights, and the public rate was about 170 euros per night.
I primarily chose the hotel because it seemed well-regarded and was available on points. While it was easy to get inexpensive cabs to the center of the city, for those who want to walk or use public transportation, I would not recommend this property as a good base for touring.
The hotel website does advertise a shuttle to the city center, but it didn’t seem to be available during my stay.
The ride into Athens was pleasant and the traffic late Sunday afternoon wasn’t too bad. When we arrived at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens, there were several bellmen up front and I was quickly assisted with my luggage.
I have IHG One Rewards Diamond Status but inside, there was no clearly marked elite check-in. That said, the line was not long and I was seen quickly.
I was thanked for choosing to use my IHG One Rewards Points at the hotel and for being an elite member of IHG One Rewards. I was informed I was upgraded on account of my status. However, I was not proactively offered late check out or free breakfast, a benefit of Diamond status in the recently overhauled program.
But when I asked, I was promptly advised of the free breakfast benefit. At this property, the breakfast is a buffet in the lobby restaurant.
The lobby had an interesting sculpture and plenty of seating as well as a bar. The bar seemed to only be open at night, and I did not visit during my stay.
I booked a king classic room on points for this stay. At check-in, I was advised that I had been upgraded to a city view room, which sells for about 50 euros per night more than the classic room.
All in all, not the most exciting upgrade but not unsurprising for IHG. Despite advertising the potential for suite upgrades, IHG does not proactively upgrade Diamond elites in the way World of Hyatt does for Globalists.
After check-in formalities were complete, I was given my room key and sent on my way. I was assigned to room 514.
To get to guest room floors you need to scan your key at the elevator, something I was not advised of at check-in. I found my room quickly and a few minutes later, there was a knock at my door with my bag.
I have stayed at several InterContinental properties and the room felt like some of the others. The decor was nice and unoffensive.
True to its name, the window had an uninteresting view of the city. The blackout curtains on the window were fantastic, something I have found rare these days.
There was a nice sitting area with a couch and coffee table, as well as a proper desk area. I have found that many hotels are cutting desks out of guest rooms in recent years so I definitely did appreciate the desk.
The bathroom had a bidet and bathtub/shower.
Toiletries were in fixed big pump bottles, locker room style. As seems to be standard for InterContinental, they were by Byredo. This is one of my favorite brands, so it was great to see that.
Unfortunately, the bathtub/shower had only a half piece of glass sheet instead of a proper door, a hotel design trend I really hate. My preference is for floor-to-ceiling walls or sliding glass doors.
The bathroom had bathrobes hanging, and in a drawer in the closet just across, there were slippers, which is a nice touch.
I didn’t get pictures of the closet space at the front of the room, but there was a nice amount of storage space as well as a safe. There was also a minibar and an electric kettle with coffee, tea and mugs.
The bedding was fairly comfortable and I slept well on it. As noted the blackout curtains were fantastic and shut out all the light from entering the room.
I didn’t use the couch & sitting area much, but I did appreciate having the extra space.
Wifi was free for IHG Rewards members who booked direct, which is standard across many IHG properties. While IHG does not offer complimentary water for elites as some other programs do, I have found some InterContinental and Crowne Plaza properties offer it anyway. This was not one of those properties.
Diamond elite members get free breakfast at Cafezoe, which is on the lobby level and open from 6:30 am to 11 am daily. When I went down, I was seated pretty quickly and never found the restaurant to be too crowded. It did though take some time to be acknowledged by the wait staff and be offered coffee.
This did not end up making much difference. The coffee was pretty mediocre. There was a nice buffet on the side of the dining room as well as a made-to-order egg station.
The breakfast buffet was quite extensive, featuring waffles and French toast, several other hot items, and a rather good selection of fresh produce. There were also several cheeses and meats, and a good selection of cereal.
The end of the buffet had a bread station and a good selection of breakfast pastries.
Keeping kosher, I did not eat much but found that the produce was fine. I asked some of my fellow guests what they thought and the consensus seemed to be the food was meh, and not as good as it looked.
The hotel advertised a fitness center and spa, though I never visited them. The hotel has an outdoor pool, which was not open during my visit.
February is typically the coldest month of the year in Athens, and the pool is open seasonally from May to October. It’s located on the lobby level, just outside Cafezoe. It’s small, but it looks like it would be rather nice on a hot summer day.
Given the small size of the pool deck, I imagine it wouldn’t be easy to score a lounge chair.
All of the staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful, though service was definitely the most proactive or personalized. But I wouldn’t really expect proactive or personalized service from a massive 500+ room property operated by IHG.
As noted above, service at Cafezoe for breakfast wasn’t the fastest despite the fact the dining room wasn’t crowded, but the servers were friendly.
My main gripe is that on the first morning of my stay, I woke up to a housekeeping staff member walking into my room. They did not knock. A few days later, I was taking a quick shower before check out, and a housekeeping employee also just walked in without knocking.
Staff entering guest rooms without knocking is one of my big hotel pet peeves. It should frankly be completely unacceptable at a luxury property.
Finally, on the last day, I had a late checkout and was prepping to head to the airport. After the normal checkout time but ahead of my late checkout, it felt like they were just chasing me out. Not the way to leave a great taste in this Diamond elite’s mouth. In an effort to move on to the next leg of my trip, I opted not to pursue the matter at check out or with management.
The InterContinental Athenaeum Athens is a solid property and a comfortable place to stay in Athens. The rooms are nice. For IHG One Rewards Diamond members, the treatment is okay if not particularly polished or proactive. While the immediate area isn’t very nice, it’s very cheap and easy to get to the heart of Athens. I would definitely return at the right price, but for my next visit to Athens, I think I’d prefer a more central property.

April 22nd - 25th, 2017
The Greek Island Hamburger continued with a couple days in Athens.
I’ve been pretty excited to make it to Greece, and specifically Athens, for the mixture of classical and biblical history it boasts. Athens has only exploded in size within the last century and with the economic troubles facing Greece, it sorta curled up it’s gangly adolescent body into the fetal position and hasn’t cleaned it’s room in a while (i.e. it’s dirty). But don’t be mistaken by that description — with the right expectations this city is a satisfying destination.
So what should you expect?
Open and friendly residents. If you get out of the tourist areas, most anyone will strike up a conversation with you. We talked extensively with a hairdresser, kebab business owners, and fellow bus riders.
Lots of immigrants. Like all big cities, Athens is culturally rich with Albanians, Bangladeshis, Turks, and many other regional immigrants making there way there to find work. The recent crises has made that even more challenging, and if you take time to ask questions you can learn lots about the 100s of lives that people live — all of which you likely haven’t experienced.
Countless affordable and mouth watering eats. The upside of visiting areas struggling economically are that things are cheap (and a heavy dose of moral lamenting over white privilege). We found that the tantalizing Mediterranean dishes and tastes didn’t suffer. Typically, we cook several meals but we ditched that norm and ate out as much as possible. €2.60 for a gyros, €2 for a Freddo ( iced expresso loaded with cream — a Greek regular), €7 for an overflowing platter of kebab, chicken and pork skewers, sausage, fries and salad, enough for 4 people. These prices and food were unreal. I’m thinking heavily about our return to Athens and eating my way through every street.
When we weren’t stuffing our faces, we were matching pace with your typical Athenian vacation and trying to hit every historical site the city holds, or at least each one that was included in the €30 pass.
Our tour started with the Ancient Agora of Athens — where the likes of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle discussed philosophy, prodded passersby with questions, and established a framework of thinking that has been rehearsed and revised for generations. It was also the very marketplace where Paul wandered through waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him in Acts 17. His impassioned discussion of the gospel led him up to the Areopagus, or Mars Hill, where he spoke before the Athenian council.
After the agora it was up to the Areopagus and of course the Acropolis, the mountain top holy ground of Athens, where the Parthenon and other ancient structures built to honor the gods still stand after 2400+ years. Apparently they were in tip top shape until the Venetians bombed them in the 1600s and then more recently even worse — acid rain started eating away at them.
Dancing in the rain seems less romantic.
There’s loads more of ancient things scattered throughout Athens. We visited the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Library (he was a big fan of the Greeks), Aristotle’s Lyceum, and the Roman Agora. Each sparked a deeper appreciation for the concepts and theories produced during that era and prodded us to want more of a classical education for our kids. One comment I found provoking was that the founding fathers knew far more classical history than any of our current senators and representatives — I wonder how much the slide into practical education and politicking contributes to the partisan decline of Washington.
But enough of that. After two days of intense site-seeing (and eating) it was time to set sail for island life!

The most shameless Roam-clone has thrown in the towel. While predictable, it’s sad when a project closes down. It’s not fun to do and closes beautifully imagined possibilities for the team and for the public. (As a side note, though, this update seems like they left users with only an unsupported way to download the data, which would be distinctly un-classy.)
What’s next for the Personal Knowledge Space? While Athens was never a significant part of it, this is an opportunity to reflect on where we’re at and what’s coming.
The big recent trend is the sudden addition of Artificial Intelligence all over. One day, AI generated images and text were ubiquitous. The change was hard to miss, largely due to the undercurrent of panic by people who benefit from writing online, asking “Did we… all just get commoditized?”. It went from a promised future to cheaply accessible reality seemingly overnight.
The Personal Knowledge Space has long sought the possibilities of AI. You’ve got a whole mess of personalized data in there. It should be useful for key benefits like finding connections, creating summaries, and improving writing skills. It remains to be seen, however, if this influx of AI is good for the startups. When Notion lets people write a post with a simple prompt, how do startups provide unique enough value to get new users?
A good moat is both valuable and hard to replicate. Using AI to create short summaries or improve writing skills is valuable but extremely easy to replicate. It seems unlikely a note-taking startup will be able to come up with a better writing/summary model than the rest of the market. Finding connections between writing is useful, but not that valuable to most people. Tags and search do a good enough job for most people.
Mem.ai’s take is to focus on surfacing relevant content even outside of search. They will show contextual information as you are writing — and claim it’s even good at pulling in data from outside of their app (think Google Drive, Calendar, etc). It’s as good an approach as any. I think there are ways it will be somewhat useful, if not essential. My larger concern with targeting the work use-case is the tech giants seem positioned to win. Microsoft, for example, is great at getting people inside their ecosystem and is better placed to pull up relevant data. If they ever feel they will benefit from taking away Mem.ai’s access to their documents they will do it. This is also true of Google, who have been doing an impressive job making their business offerings good. (Have you seen Google docs recently? Damn! Functionality is coming together.).
One point in Mem’s favor is their “Spotlight” feature. It opens up a Command Line Interface that can do fancy things live save the URL of your current tab, start a new note, or add a note to an existing one. I like this because it’s a step towards making non-developers feel like they have the power of developers.
While the value of the AI use cases I described seems iffy, PKM startups have a huge potential advantage in that area. It’s what kicked off Roam’s popularity. Roam took off because people wanted to share the scripts (code-based and organizational) they used with others, and were rewarded for doing so. Empowering new groups of people that way builds extreme loyalty (see Excel), and startups have a better path to doing so than the tech giants. Startups can better find the small niches of weirdos that include myself and figure out ways to empower them. The real benefit is in making a small group of users more powerful, not in making things easy for everyone.
I’m hopeful we’ll get there! There’s a ton of innovation going on in the space still. Tara’s has their own concept of empowering users through advanced configuration that seems promising and new companies keep coming.

It’s a February Sunday morning. Plenty of cold and a lovely pale sun in the sky of Athens!
We parked our car in Michael Voda street and we tried to find which way to go. “Let’s go by that side” I say to him. As we walk by, I see families running hand in hand. Looking at the Church and its main entrance, I say to him: “Here we are”.
We enter the courtyard of the parish of the Sacred Heart. We stand outside — a feeling of dread is not letting us go inside the church. While we take out our cameras and shoot pictures of the statues, of the icons, of the stained glass of the church, I notice that people haven’t stopped coming in their parish. I had never seen so many young people in a church on a Sunday morning! Young parents, young women and men, children, teenagers… Everyone was there, in a crowded church where the children sang hymns accompanied by a Catholic nun who played the guitar. The priest began the Holy Mass in Polish. After all, the majority of believers in this parish are Poles who live in this district of the capital. “The Roman Catholic Greeks who still live in this area of Athens are now few. However, the Jesuits do have a daily Mass in Greek for these Greeks”, Irene told me when we met each other a few days later. The Jesuits are a living cell in this part of Athens. Poles, Catholics, but also people who really need the Jesuits’ presence live close to this area.
But who are the Jesuits?
Irene Koutelaki, Communication Officer of the Jesuits community in Greece, would give me all the information I needed for my cover story concerning the Jesuits in Greece. Our communication started by email and later on, we had many in –person meetings. Through the ten pages of Irene’s notes, we found the information that help us explore the world of the Jesuits.
“The Jesuits are a male Catholic religious Order. What characterize each Order are its spirituality and its different field of apostolic activity. So an Order can be educational, contemplative, or action-oriented when its action has to do with active involvement in society”,  Irene would emphasize to me the meaning of the word “Presence”. So we’re talking about the presence of the Jesuit order in Greece. “In every country where the Jesuits are present, there may be one or more communities, that is, monasteries or otherwise ‘houses’ as the Jesuits call them. There are two houses in Greece: one in Athens and another one in Tinos Island. “A few years ago there was another house in Syros which stopped functioning because of the shrinking number of the Jesuits in Greece. However, the building is still used by the Jesuits when a need arises. ”
Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam
“Finding God in all things.”
This is a typical phrase used by the Order and it means that God is close to people, whatever situation they live in, as long as people have our hearts open to discern His presence. The “Apostolic Preferences”, are a selection of directions focusing on the work the Jesuits have to strive for, over a period of the ten next years. They were announced in February 2019, by Father Arturo Sosa, Father General of the Jesuits worldwide, following his election by the General Assembly in 2016, after a lengthy process of discernment of the areas where there the Jesuits are called to offer their service and to work along with society around the world.
Early March, Wednesday afternoon
We arrive at Victoria Square by the train. It is already evening and we are running to catch up with Irene who waits for us in the church. Upon our arrival, I see the lights of the church switched on and I suppose that at this hour and day, there must be a Mass in Greek. “Is anyone inside the church waiting for the service to start?” I thought. Stained-glass windows radiate, while the entire neighborhood is plunged into darkness. We ring the bell. Irene opens the door for us and takes us for a guided tour to the premises of the Jesuits that lasted more than two hours.
The calling
“Every Jesuit is a different case! In the Catholic Church, we talk about a calling, a “vocation”, as we say it. The way each religious man or woman experienced this vocation, is a very personal matter”. Becoming a Jesuit is a long journey that involves years of education / training and discernment, which are meant for the novices to understand where God calls them to offer their life and work. Part of their studies is accomplished abroad, where they work as missionaries. This way, they come into contact with other cultures; they experience the problems and needs of the world. “As regards specifically our own Greek Jesuits, the oldest comes from the islands of Tinos and Syros, where there is a strong Catholic community”.
A long time ago I had asked Irene if the Holy Masses are regular. “They are celebrated daily. On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 19.00 in Polish, on Wednesday and Friday at 19.00 in Greek. The Holy Mass, of course, is performed in both languages during weekends: on Saturday at 19.00 and on Sunday at 11.00 in Greek. On Saturday at 20.00 and on Sunday at 09.30, 12.30 and 19.00 in Polish”. After a Sunday morning Mass, in a church full of Poles, I wanted to know what keeps people so connected to the Church.
The area where this parish is located — that is, Vathi Square, Victoria Square, Larissa Station — was once one of the most prosperous districts of Athens, until the beginning of the 90’s. The gradual decline of this area led a large number of residents to move to other areas of Attica, and thus the number of Roman Catholic Greeks was dramatically reduced. The result: today’s Greek parishioners are older and very few in comparison to the past, and this is easily noticed if someone attends a Holy Mass in Greek.
In the 1980s, a large wave of immigrants from Poland came to the country in search of a better life — before the collapse of communism. Many of them settled in the area. The Jesuits had to serve the spiritual needs of Polish believers, so they celebrated Holy Masses and they administered the Sacraments in the Polish language, so that they could understand. Today, Poland’s political life has changed. Many Poles who initially settled in Athens returned home as the financial crisis in Greece affected those immigrants, depriving them the opportunity to find work. Many Polish Catholics returned home, but still, they outnumber the Greek parishioners. Those who still stay in Athens have married Greeks, or Poles, and have created a family here — so their lives are here, in Greece, and not in Poland anymore, since they have lived here more years than in their home country. Their children are Greek. They speak Greek and not so much Polish.
At the same time, in the 1990s, many Albanians with Catholic background came to Athens, or atheists who were baptized, or converted along the way and became Catholics. Those Albanians, who are parishioners of the Parish of the Sacred Heart of the Savior, attend the Holy Mass in Greek.
As we are stepping into Irene’s office, we see shelves full of magazines. All these are issues of «Ανοιχτοί Ορίζοντες» (Open Horizons) magazine, of which she is the editor. I placed my cup of coffee on her desk and started browsing them, while she suggested some issues that could have some academic interest in my field. “ ‘Open Horizons’ was founded in 1900 under the name ‘Messenger of the Sacred Heart of Jesus’ and was published as such until 1975, when it was renamed ‘Messenger — Open Horizons’. In 2007 it was merged with «Σύγχρονα Βήματα» (Contemporary Steps) journal (1970–2007), which dealt with philosophical, theological, social, and cultural topics.
Today, ‘Open Horizons’ is the historical, subscription-based, Catholic journal of the Jesuits in Greece for social and religious reflection, published by the Institute for Human Studies of the Jesuits in Greece, and, together with the newspaper “Katholiki”, are the two official news publications of the Catholic Church in Greece. The mission of the magazine is to present, analyze, and inform Catholic or non-Catholic readers about the Catholic Church and how it perceives major issues of society, faith and human life, aims to their religious education and the cultivation of faith, while at the same time it aims at strengthening fraternal dialogue with other Christian denominations and the whole society”.
“I first saw the Open Horizons magazine two years ago on Syros island”, I told Irene. “I walked out of St. George’s school an afternoon in Syros, and I saw a lot of magazines. Nobody had touched those magazines. Apparently the magazines kept being sent to one or many subscribers who were no longer there to read them…”.
“The magazine has subscribers from all over Greece and also subscribed institutions, such as charity foundations or educational organizations. Most of our subscribers are from Syros Island but we also have subscriptions from people who know and appreciate the work of the Jesuits in the field of education. The magazine’s existence, of course, is not guaranteed by subscriptions at all”, Irene told us.
People are rushing upstairs, and Irene is asking Ms. Eleni Loukou, a librarian and archivist, to open the rooms where the Archive of the Jesuit order is kept in Greece. It contains rare parchments, audiovisual material, incunabula, fermans from the Ottoman Empire and other valuable material that is waiting to be used by researchers, historians, students and other interested people. At the other side of the hall is the Library of the Jesuits in Greece which contains over 40,000 titles, and a reading room open to the public from 08.30 to 16.00 on working days. Ancient and rare books from the 15th century onwards, and books of the 18th and 19th centuries kept in the Jesuit House of Tinos were transferred to Athens, very recently. In order to display and use its contents, the Library and Archive participate in conferences, organize activities such as the “Living Libraries” a few weeks ago, and take the necessary steps to maintain and preserve the books and the Archive properly. The Library is a part of the Institute for Human Studies. The Institute is an institution founded in 2008 by the Jesuits in Athens to promote research, study and education based on scientific methodology and principles, and the Ignatian spirituality.
We close the library door, take our coffee, our notebooks for notes, and start stepping up the stairs. The lighting is not adequate; I noticed something shimmering on the stairs. I bend over to look at the small gilded descriptions that eventually write “Jesuit Refugee Service — JRS”.
Earlier I had read in the notes that:
The Jesuit Refugee Service — Greece (JRS — Greece), which is the Jesuit fathers’ service for refugees, began its operation in 2015. It is a global network of social welfare and support for refugees, migrants, victims of natural disasters and other difficult circumstances. JRS — Greece is part of JRS Europe, which is part of the global JRS International network.
Initially, Jesuit fathers offered their rooms and houses to refugees, usually families, or mothers with young children, or unaccompanied children who were drowned to see finally the mainland. In the beginning, in those rooms, they could rest for a few hours, take a bath, and be provided with food and clean clothes. Along the way, it evolved into a permanent place of residence for refugees, who have been here for more than a month, until the required documents are prepared and finally left for abroad. Here again, with the help of social workers and volunteers, refugee activities are carried out and their children are engaged in creative activities, while those who are school-age children have the necessary procedures to get enrolled in local public schools, until it’s time for them to go abroad with their family. JRS — Greece has been active since the first wave of refugees reaching Piraeus port (the biggest port of Greece) and the islands by providing clean clothing, food and essential hygiene kits to these people. Today JRS operates in Lesvos, in the camps, offering not only material assistance but also psychological, emotional and moral support. ”
We enter the refugees’ rooms. Each door belongs to a family room. I take a glance at the room with the light from where the female voices come from. Women are gathered in the kitchen while their young ones are wandering around their feet. The youngest of the group will go down the aisle to greet us with curiosity and wrap us around our feet..
“There have been very difficult cases. These women went through a lot and when they came here they had to take their lives in their hands. Many times we had to persuade them to go up to Victoria Square where the food was distributed. They were afraid to walk for a few meters. Here again they have started slowly learning about coexistence, empowerment and resolving conflicts between them. ”
“Let’s leave now because we can disturb them and interfere with their daily lives,” Irene says, whispering. We follow her while her phrase will be stuck in my head until today as I type these sentences ..
We take our things from the Irene’s office, put on our jackets and go out on the road to go to the “house” next to the Church. While entering I saw a colorful place full of paintings. A large plush giraffe warmly welcomed us.
We leave the main building. “It’s just like a house that happened to have a lot of kids.” I think. The bell rings and children of all ages pour out in the halls of the old building, with their bags and books in their hands. All ages, all nationalities, girls and boys, all religions.
Going up to the first floor, I see the kitchen. “Here Father Peter’s father volunteers to help with the children’s lunch.” Father Petros leaves the students in the classroom for a while and comes out to greet us. Having his back turned doesn’t mean he doesn’t know exactly what’s going on in the classroom. Just a little bit further I see a girl studying English by herself… “We launched this initiative in 2011. There were children on the street that did not attend or drop out of school because of indifference or difficulties such as absent parents who worked all day to support their family. These children could not live up to their childhood. It is mainly a population of immigrants who relied on their children to help them in this new country, as they did not know the language of the new country.’’ “Pedro Arrupe Youth Center” has become a place for study, personal development and educational empowerment. The purpose of the Center is also to widen the horizons of children and young people in three key areas, ‘Know-Open up-Believe’. They seek to get to know themselves through creative activities such as music, theater, crafts, and foreign languages ​​and to develop interpersonal relationships as they find themselves in an environment which is a meeting point for children from different backgrounds.
The aim is to help each child and to shape them as much as possible in a structured and enjoyable environment, given that in addition to the financial and survival problems that these children and their families face, they also have to deal with phenomena of domestic violence, against which the Center’s Director, Mrs Argiro Hadjiantoniou, has taken drastic measures. Today, Pedro Arrupe Youth Center has over 150 children, many of whom, in addition to their supportive teaching and pedagogical programs (based on the Jesuit education), are offered daily hot meals and food for their families.
“Parents sometimes work with us and sometimes they don’t. We explain to them that the Center is not a place where they can “park” their child; we want them to be actively involved. In many cases, children do not listen to their parents and we are the last stronghold”.
There is a room a little different from the others … The room of fantasy, the room of the magical world.
I walk in this room, Father Petros turns off the lights and explains to me how the magic room works. “During an internal assessment, we found that our children suffer from lack of imagination. So this room was transformed into a fantasy room. Here, with the educator who has taken over, the Center’s kids wear a hat and start telling a story the rest of the kids”.
Each day, the Center welcomes children of all ages from countries: Nigeria, Congo, Angola, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq and Bangladesh. “Here we work with children until 19:30 and then they can return home.” “The Center works with volunteers, mainly Greeks but also from other countries — Italy, Portugal, Spain etc. They are not necessarily members of the Catholic Church and their contribution is invaluable”. “We are often confronted with domestic violence and we have to identify it and then deal with it”. As we begin to descend to the ground floor again and greet them goodbye, Father Peter explains to me: “We didn’t include lunch time when the Center started operating. As the time passed, we noticed that children could not concentrate on their lessons. The reason was that they were just extremely hungry”. Before saying goodbye, Father Petros can’t hide his joy: “Some of our kids passed the FCE exam in English. It is an accomplishment. I wish they could all pass the exams”. Saying goodbye to them was not so easy… They gave me printed material: “Open Horizons” magazine, the “Pedro Arrupe Youth Center” newspaper, photos, the Jesuit Refugee Service leaflet. As we leave, we see the Superior of the Jesuits in Greece who is leaving to watch a performance along with two volunteers of JRS — Ellada. We bid farewell to Irene outside her office and we are about to leave. Maybe I don’t remember well… the church lights were turned off and the stained-glass windows were not lit. We get into the subway and I hold tight my bag with my notes and my camera.
July — August 2019 It took me a long time to write this article — cover story. I would like to put my thoughts and my feelings in order. What I remember is that in a degraded neighborhood of Athens where most of us have never been, miracles happen every day. I will keep in my heart the words of Father Peter and Irene. Words that reminded me it is best not to use other people’s sufferings for marketing and sponsorship purposes, of for shooting photos. Not to sacrifice the uniqueness of others and the uniqueness of their life … Because God is everywhere around us … and certainly God exists in those few square meters of Michael Voda street. I would like to thank Irene Koutelaki for her valuable help, for answering to all my questions and for gathering useful information for me. Most of the cover story information is based on her own text. If you would like to know more about what was mentioned in the text, you can find it in the following links:

I am an African American woman living in Athens, Greece. I’m used to going to the grocery store and seeing people that look like me. I am accustomed to attending events or bars and seeing other black people dancing and having fun. I grew up in a black Methodist church where the people were my extended family, my community. I would go to my mother's on Sunday evenings and have dinner with her and my grandmother, surrounded by my beautifully black matriarch.
I walk the Athenian streets in my new town feeling like I am the only black person people have ever seen. Anywhere I go, I’m stared at as if there is a giant clown nose attached to my face. In my everyday life, I am 99% of the time the only black person in the room, building, train, or party. It used to REALLY bother me to feel so isolated while pursuing my professional career, but now I choose not to give it much attention. However, sometimes the waves of missing the black community crash upon my heart.
On one particular day, while I was out shopping, I was called a N***** by some boys at the mall. I felt angry that this racism followed me here from the States. I left the mall and continued shopping, aggravated, arguing about what I…

This charming mountain village boasts stunning scenery, authentic local culture, and a unique atmosphere that sets it apart from the crowds.
When you arrive, you’ll be greeted by crisp mountain air and the picturesque sight of quaint stone houses adorned with vibrant blooms lining the winding streets. Unlike souvenir shops peddling mass-produced goods, Arachova’s stores brim with unique locally crafted treasures. Engaging with friendly vendors becomes an opportunity to discover hidden gems and learn about the local artisanship.
Instead of following a rigid itinerary, allow yourself to get lost in the charming maze of streets. Each twist and turn reveals hidden delights — a cafe serving melt-in-your-mouth baklava, a sun-drenched square buzzing with lively conversation, or an ancient church whispering tales of its storied past. Time seems to slow down here, inviting you to savor each moment like a sip of the local honey wine, rich and smooth with the essence of the mountains.

I’m perched on a rocky outcrop below the Acropolis, the Parthenon’s columns catching the last golden light of the day. Down in Plaka, motorbikes zip past tavernas where locals clink glasses of ouzo. My sneakers are caked with dust from the climb, and I’m nursing a €2 Greek coffee from a street vendor, feeling like I’ve landed in a city that’s half myth, half street party. Athens, the beating heart of Greece, is home to 3.1 million people and over 2,500 years of stories. It’s a place where ancient ruins rub shoulders with graffiti-covered bars, and siesta naps give way to late-night souvlaki runs. Whether you’re here to walk in Socrates’ footsteps, chase the perfect moussaka, or stumble into a hidden neighborhood, Athens delivers a trip you’ll be talking about for years.

Ancient Athens was a center for the arts, learning, and philosophy, the home of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum, Athens was also the Birthplace of Socrates, Plato, Pericles, Aristophanes, Sophocles, and many other well-known philosophers, writers, and politicians of ancient Greece. It is widely referred to as the Cradle of Democracy, and Western Civilization mainly due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC on the then-European Continent.
Pericles (495–429 BCE), came from an illustrious aristocratic family and was an Athenian statesman, general, orator, and arts patron. He was Pivotal in the development of Athenian democracy and the Athenian empire.
He helped establish democracy in Athens and is considered the first citizen of a democratic Athens. He transformed its alliances into an empire. Rebuild the Acropolis after it was destroyed by the Persian invasion. And many more.
He believed in the wisdom of the goddess Athena, the guiding spirit of Athens. And lived by his rational ideologies

Athens, the historical and cultural capital of Greece, is a city steeped in history located on the shores of the Aegean Sea. Known as the birthplace of ancient Greek civilization, this city exudes an atmosphere filled with history at every corner. On my recent trip, I embarked on a journey to explore Athens, and I couldn’t help but be enchanted by this unique experience.
Journey to the Acropolis:
Upon arriving in Athens, my first stop was, of course, the Acropolis. This ancient citadel, a symbol of Greece, is perched atop a high hill and greets visitors with the splendor of the Parthenon Temple. As I ascended to the Acropolis, walking among the historical ruins, I felt the excitement of traversing through time. Rediscovering the captivating beauty of the ancient era against the backdrop of the city’s panoramic views filled me with profound admiration.
Plaka District:
Descending from the Acropolis, I visited the heart of the city, known as the Plaka District. With its narrow cobblestone streets, colorful shops, and traditional taverns, Plaka is one of the liveliest and most charming neighborhoods in Athens. Here, while savoring local delicacies, I found myself immersed in a unique blend of ancient and modern atmospheres.
Ancient Agora and Old Town:
To delve deeper into Athens’ historical fabric, I made my way to the Ancient Agora. This was the place where philosophers like Socrates and Plato once walked. Roaming among the ruins of the Agora felt like embarking on a journey through the past. Afterwards, getting lost in the narrow streets of the Old Town and wandering among the traditional houses made me feel as if time stood still.
Modern Athens:
Athens not only boasts the legacy of ancient times but also thrives as a modern city. Central points like Monastiraki Square and Syntagma Square are lined with modern cafes, restaurants, and shopping centers. Exploring these areas allowed me to discover the modern and dynamic side of the city.
As I strolled through the streets of Athens, I savored the experience of exploring a city intertwined with history. Following the footsteps of ancient Greek civilization while experiencing the vibrant atmosphere of a modern capital was an unforgettable experience. Athens was not just a trip for me; it was a journey through time. A bridge between the past and the future was built before my eyes, and this experience will forever leave a lasting impression on me.

What makes a civilization great? A civilization achieves greatness when various facets of humanity — physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual — are allowed to blossom and find full expression.
When you look at the ruins of Athens, you see evidence of this greatness.
Many impressive cities in history have made great contributions to the growth of human civilization, but few have come close to what Athens came to achieve and represent. When I visited the city I found the testament of its greatness written in stones; in its broken columns and fallen walls.
As you reach Athens, you see its skyline dominated by a cluster of massive structures on a hilltop. These were magnificent temples, now only ruins, which towered over the city in its glorious days.
The most impressive among the structures is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Goddess Athena. Its imposing columns striving to kiss the sky stir within one the ever-present yearning to transcend our earthly limits and reach for something beyond.
For a moment transport yourself to ancient Athens and observe the Athenians doing their everyday, mundane chores; haggling over the price of wheat in the market, herding their sheep to olive gardens, plotting a…

What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.
— Attributed to Pericles, 5th Century BCE
Ancient Athens is often referred to as the birthplace of Western thought. Whilst we have a lot to thank the Athenians for in terms of the invention of education as we know it, critical thinking, science, democracy, technology and architecture, everyday life looked a lot different back then. There were vast inequalities depending on gender, political and economic standing, for one only free men were classed as citizens, with females and slaves living a much more restrictive life.
In this article, we’ll delve into what life would have looked like as an inhabitant of Athens, in terms of their occupation; diet; how they socialised; where they lived and what family life looked like.
Athens, as a thriving and bustling coastal city boasted a vast array of different occupations of all skill sets and familial backgrounds. From high ranking jobs in the military, philosophical tutors, local government officials to the less well paying jobs such as fishing, farming and everything in between. Many made their living through the marketplace- the…

Talking with User Interface & User Experience Designers

Matt D. Smith is the owner and Design Director at Studio Mds, a small independent design studio in Athens, GA. He created the Float Label Pattern for digital form input fields, which is now a design standard in Google’s Material Design Guidelines. He’s a proud father of four and has led creative work for agencies and brands in the US and Singapore including NBC, AT&T, Sprint, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Dwell, Razorfish, Sapient and more.
When your friends or parents ask to you what job do you do, how do you answer?
I tell them I’m a designer and work mostly on websites and mobile apps. Everyone knows what those things are so this answer proves most digestible for a layman.
What is your background, how did you train?
I was always drawing when I was a kid. In college I gravitated towards drawing and painting and eventually made my way into the Graphic Design department at the University of Georgia. There I learned a lot of the fundamentals of design–typography, white space, color, contrast, etc. After graduating I got heavily involved in the Flash community and taught myself Actionscript 2.0. This sparked my passion for digital design.
What the web can do to make this world a better place? How did the web improve your life( if it did)?
The web can’t do anything on its own–it needs people. It’s a powerful tool to connect humans all over the world around a specific thing. The possibilities are endless.
Can you show us three examples of interface that in your opinion improved human life?
“Improving human life” is definitely subjective depending on whom you ask. I’d say a few that make my life easier are iMessage, Fantastical, and Dropbox. iMessage for short specific bursts of communication. Fantastical for its natural language input to create events. And finally, Dropbox that reliably keeps all of my digital stuff wherever I go.
On quora.com, time ago there was a long discussion in answer to the question “what is the most intuitive interface ever created?”; according to Felipe Rocha it is the nipple, in your opinion instead? (http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-intuitive-interfaces-ever-created)
Hmm, maybe fruit. It appeals to most of your senses–sight, smell, feel, taste. It serves a core human need, hunger. It’s also nutritious. =)
How is your work day type?
I get into work around 8 AM and try to write first thing in the morning before email, jumping into design, or anything else. From then on until around 5pm, it’s design, emails, etc. all day.
What is the most stimulating and challenging project you have accomplished?
The most challenging project I’ve worked on so far has been Shiplify, a commercial transportation management system. There are huge amounts of information along with the constraint of a mobile device that really leveled up my thinking and skills.
What is, among the existing digital services, the one you wanted to do?
Hah, I’m still trying to figure that out.
Many designers commit the mistake of starting a project directly from Photoshop, is there a perfect design method? What is your approach to the creative process?
Starting in Photoshop is a good way to create art, but not solve a problem. The more experience I gain as a designer, the more time I wait before jumping into a design. I start with lots and lots of questions about the problem we’re trying to solve and why.
The “design” is an important part of our analogic life. What is the role of the designer in our digital life?
The core role of the designer hasn’t changed much from analog to digital. It remains to communicate visually. The trick is to find out what you’re trying to communicate and why.
Do you believe it is important for a designer to have a deep knowledge of matters as User Experience, Interaction Design, Product Design, and Front-end development?
It depends on what the designer wants to do with her personal career, but I if she wants to be the best she can possibly be, she’ll need to have a relentless pursuit of knowledge of her craft. Learning to code, etc. will only help her connect dots easier and gain a better understanding of digital products overall.
In which way do you make a difference between User Interface and user experience?
The UX is the design in its entirety– the alpha and the omega. From the words on the very first entry screen, to a payment receipt sent via email, UX covers it all. It is holistic, from business strategy to behavioral design. The UI is a smaller portion of the broader picture that deals specifically with the parts people touch and click. The two are deeply intertwined and should be considered in parallel. Sometimes UX decisions can be enhanced by UI design and vice versa. The best UI designers will also be great UX designers. I’m not a big fan of segmenting the titles of UX and UI designer, which is why I call myself simply a designer. I do both.
What is your relationship with the developers? There are people that have a relationship of continuous confrontation and other of deep friendship, where do you collocate with respect to this question?
If you want to work well with others, there needs to be friendship and common ground. If you find yourself constantly at odds with developers or anyone else for that matter, you’re doing it wrong. There’s a degree of humility that needs to be present for people to work together harmoniously.
How do you think that your career and job will evolve in the next 5 years?
I’ll always design things. It’s my thing, ya know? With that said, I do see myself transitioning to more strategy, planning, and writing to build my own products as opposed to only doing client work.
A famous quotation of David Carson (noted American graphic designer) says: “Graphic design will save the world right after rock and roll does”.Will the User Interface Design save the world, before, at the same time, or after the graphic design?
After. UI is no savior.
What do you think about Dribbble? Is it a good way to get a job? What’s the best way to find a job as designer?
Dribbble is amazing. I’ve met great people there and it’s delivered lots of job opportunities. People often mention Dribbble as a place where people focus on shallow design and getting likes, but that’s not Dribbble’s fault, that’s people’s fault. Look at Facebook, it’s an amazing communication tool, but it becomes mind-numbing after too much exposure–not because of the software, because of the content.
Dribbble is what you make it.
What book would you advice to a Junior Designer?
Hmm, that’s tough. There are so many great books; my suggestion would be to read constantly. There isn’t a magic bullet. You have to progress gradually. One book that I’m really enjoying at the moment is Peter Thiel’s, “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future”
Always as far as advices: what tools for the design?
Beyond wireframes, I’ve become a big Sketch fanatic for UI design. I still use Photoshop regularly for different things, but Sketch is now my goto for layout out UI for a website or an app.
What tools for the projects management?
For wireframing, I swear by Adobe Illustrator. I’ve tried out most software for this purpose and Illustrator is by far the fastest and most versatile vector editor there is. In fact, I’ve created a whole blog series devoted to rapid UX design with Adobe Illustrator, which can be found at http://aiux.co

In 1867 Matthew Arnold wrote a book titled Culture and Anarchy in which he held up two saving springs of our civilization: Athens — from which we get the inner urge to “see things as they really are” — and Jerusalem, from which we get the directive “to set doing above knowing.”
I don’t know if I would draw the contrast between these two civilizational sources in the terms that Arnold used. But I do know that, in studying, teaching and loving philosophy as I do, while at the same time feeling myself to be Jewish at my self’s core, I must in some sense resemble the human type that Arnold was talking about.
On my last day of teaching at Brooklyn College, I passed around the attendance sheet for the Intro course and later found that the students had penned their own farewells. Since those attendance sheets now hang in my study, I can quote a line or two: “I am sure that, speaking for everybody, you touched many minds and lives. Thank you for portraying philosophy in such a user-friendly way …” or again, “Just know that you made a difference in many peoples’ lives, especially mine.”
It’s in the light of recent developments on university campuses that I’ve cast this backward glance over the terrain of my working life. What did it feel like to me, to work in the precincts of the academy — the House that Plato Built? What did it mean to me, teaching philosophy to students at Brooklyn College — that is, to young people from all over the world? My graduate school teacher of philosophy, the Straussian Stanley Rosen, described it as the disclosure of “beautiful and sacred things.” I remember Leo Bronstein — who was a celebrated teacher of art history at Brandeis — marveling, in his Russian/Catalan accents, that “the kids are forced, fo-r-r-rced (!) to learn sublime matters!”
In my turn, I viewed teaching philosophy as the transmission of a civilizational power and presence. If it was an Intro course, I would make the case for the importance to each of them of this transmission. “This will help you to decode the life you will face. It’s not true that you are what you eat. You are what you think! When you notice the way people behave, the way they frame their challenges, and the reasons or rationales they reference in explaining their decisions — you will be better able to lift out the thinking that lies back of all that.”
Sometimes I referred to the saying of Socrates that the unexamined [i.e. philosophically unsituated] life is not worth living. He meant, you’re not making the best use you can of your time here if you can’t identify and make good use of its philosophic assumptions. It’s not about choosing the “best philosophy” to live and steer by. They all have limitations or shortcomings, as does any attempt to understand a topic. No topic can be plumbed to every depth conceivable. But to know how to get to the available depths and to plumb that is a great power — empowering in the best sense — provided that (as with any power) it’s not used for harm.
So much for recalling what it was like for me to teach philosophy to real students. That said, we can fast forward to the present. What is it like to perceive young people who wear the name of “student” but mask their faces, menacing fellow students and teachers, injuring the working people who keep their academic classrooms and buildings functional? To what can I compare the predicament of a real teacher facing such defilements? Perhaps to the situation of a farmer whose field has been sown with salt and rendered barren by those means?
And what would I say to the so-called students who seem to relish doing precisely that kind of harm? If you attack the precincts of learning and teaching, you desecrate your own ability to learn or later to teach what you learned. You will still be able to be indoctrinated, and to indoctrinate others, but you can’t learn and you can no longer teach what you learned. And it’s not merely self-harm that you inflict. You injure your city, your country, your civilization. The wound you inflict has concentric circles of wounds that lie all round it.
And as for me, I wouldn’t know how to cure such wounds. Whatever healing modalities I possess — they don’t stretch that far.
At present, I have yet to reroute my life so that the powers I’ve acquired have some further riverbed channel down which to flow. I can’t just stand at the river’s edge and forever shed tears for what’s been lost.

Hypatia and her revival in Raphael’s School of Athens.,https://medium.com/@sbashllari/hypatia-and-her-revival-in-raphaelos-school-of-athens-7863799c7c80,"Sign up

The renowned masterpiece “The School of Athens” by Raphael captivates viewers with its iconic central portrayal of Aristotle and Plato, gesturing downwards and upwards, respectively. The canvas is a tapestry of intellectual luminaries, featuring figures like Heraclitus in a crouched pose beside a sturdy marble cube, and the revered Socrates and Pythagoras. The room is further enriched by the commanding presence of two statues in the corners — Apollo, the god of light and music, gracefully holding a lyre, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom (or her Roman counterpart, Minerva). Intricately weaving together the threads of knowledge, Raphael’s brushstrokes breathe life into the embodiment of wisdom.
As aptly articulated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Raphael paints wisdom.”
However, there is a lesser known ( and more disputed — arguably the most interesting) figure, dressed all in white, almost set apart from the rest of the painting and looking straight at us, as if Raphael was inviting the viewer to look more closely at this figure in his crowd of mental giants. This figure is often noted as Francesco Maria della Rovere, duke of Urbino (1490–1538). However important being a condottiero might have been, it seems that this particular persona would be a misfit in the room of eternal wisdom. Others argue that the feminine presence of this figure is indisputable, and that figure is in fact Hypatia of Alexandria, a Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, long forgotten and being revived by Raphael.
Hypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator, and best known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy’s Almagest (treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths). As noted, her philosophy was Neoplatonist and was thus seen as “pagan” at a time of bitter religious conflict between Christians (both orthodox and “heretical”), Jews, and pagans. Following the accession of Cyril to the bishopric of Alexandria, Hypatia’s fate suffered a brutal death.
“They dragged her into a building known as the Kaisarion, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using ostraka, which can either be translated as “roof tiles” or “oyster shells”. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire Unfortunately, all Hypatia’s work is lost except for its titles and some references to it by some of her students, reconstructing thus her contribution.”¹
However, back to Raphael’s painting — how can we know that is truly a woman being depicted there when the very figure of Hypatia was emblematic of heresy in the circle of the church ?
“At the same period, there was a common practice artists used, Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo each sketched full-sized cartoons of their large murals on the paper and pricked tiny holes along the contours. They then would blow charcoal through tiny holes onto the walls beneath. Each charcoal “sketch” blown onto the wall would lay the figured groundwork for the intricate painting that followed. When the mural was complete, the cartoons themselves would often be destroyed.”²
However, luckily, Raphael’s complete cartoon for School of Athens has survived and is considered “the most remarkable object of its kind surviving from the Renaissance”. In the cartoon, in a roomful of men, there is only one figure wearing a veil, a classic and common article of clothing used in depicting women in Renaissance paintings. The same veil is not present in the final painting — given that most final works needed somehow the approval of the ruling caste.
In fact, The School of Athens is part of a much larger masterwork, representing only one wall of the most brilliantly illustrated room in history — the Stanza della Segnatura, one of “Raphael’s Rooms” in the Papal Palace of the Vatican. For the first two centuries after it was created, this stanza, a private library to the popes and was only seen by the eyes of the few elite elders in the heart of the Vatican Church.

It takes place in silence, mainly as the people who are supposed to safeguard it remain too preoccupied to see what’s going on.
And that is the bitter lesson of Ancient Athens. Now America is suffering from the same blind spots.
It’s history repeating itself and rhyming with a harsh cadence.
Here’s why two democracies, old and new, might be more alike than we realize.
Athens made something radical: a body of language nobody on this planet had ever seen or heard.. government of the people, by the people.
Voting assemblies. Citizen juries. Laws that treated everybody the same, that is, at least if you were male and free.
By today’s standards it was not fair but it was a beginning.
Like America’s beginning wasn’t perfect — but it was constructed to get better.
Both systems were built on faith as much as bricks.. after people stopped caring, everything wobbled.
Lowerclass Athenians were given a voice by Pericles, who paid them to serve. That widened access.
But what it opened is the door to louder voices, not smarter ones.
As the conversation of leaders descended the crowd was humored.
Applause lines started wars. Justice was about winning a popularity contest.
It was all spectacle. And spectacle requires a villain.
America’s founders were obsessed with history.
They saw what had gone wrong in Athens and tried to slow things down through checks, balances and staggered elections.
The system functioned when people believed in it.
And now the crack is beginning to show in the walls.. Rules that are not violated but rejected.
There’s a rhythm to the drift of democracies. The lyrics are different, but the chorus strikes the same chords.
Athenian Breakdown
American Parallel
These are not symptoms in isolation. They’re a trendline.
Although this time around Athens surrendered to oligarchs after losing a war.
The Thirty Tyrants ruled brutal and short-lived, but that’s all.
The people fought back. Democracy returned.
But it limped.. not marched. What came back wasn’t what it was.
Athens was then given a second chance. It simply wasn’t strong enough for them.
There aren’t any mobs storming the assembly with swords.
No decrees, no coups..just slowbmotion neglect.
Democracy crumbles not when buildings fall in one big blow but when cracks are left unfixed.
And the tools to repair it aren’t glamorous. They’re tedious. Uncelebrated. Necessary.
Athens didn’t fail because it was flawed.
It dropped because too many trusted that it wouldn’t.
America has its warnings. They’re loud.
The resolution depends on whether we are listening to them or are the ones scrolling past.

Review of The Dave Red Athens — April 2025
Check-in was smooth, especially considering my name has a special character and often gets misspelled —I checked in online - No hassle this time, Plus points — which was a nice start. The hotel was clean and looked freshly presented, but there are some serious downsides you should know about before booking. Totally outside the control of the Dave hotel !
There is a hidden door in the ground floor library, You open it to a store room and a stain well come oncome on -dave red guys- like it a Bar.
The hotel is only a few hundred metres from Omonoia Metro Station, but walking those few hundred metres feels like crossing a dystopian wasteland. Junkies and people clearly struggling with addiction are everywhere — shooting up in doorways, passed out on the pavement, or stumbling around in a daze. One man ahead of me was swinging a syringe around like it was a cigarette, in broad daylight. I didn’t feel directly threatened, but the general atmosphere was intense and unpleasant.
You also see severely unwell women loitering — prostitutes— in what looks like a desperate state. Some stood motionless at corners like statues, others circled the same block over and over. It was deeply sad. The whole area feels forgotten and unsafe. If you’re not used to this kind of street scene, it’s genuinely shocking.
The room was fine in terms of cleanliness, but definitely unfinished. It had a clean, modern look — no carpets, just polished flooring — but the detailing wasn’t great. The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain.
The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain. I’ve worked in construction and can say with confidence — the floor of the shower area has no angle, no lip, and no waterproof tilting detail. It’s just a flat surface, of latex paint so the water spreads quickly across the bathroom floor. After five minutes of showering, you’ll find yourself standing in a puddle with water edging toward the bedroom. A proper fix would involve cutting a groove or sloping the floor slightly toward the drain — basic stuff that just wasn’t done.
Breakfast at The Dave red left a lot to be desired. Compared to nearby options — for example, The Stanley Hotel just around the corner — it was dismal. The Stanley offers a proper buffet with a rotating toaster, beautiful sour cherry syrup,for your Greek yoghurt, fried bacon, tiny sausages, scrambled eggs, and a few other hot items. The Dave, by contrast, felt like a bit of a cost-cutter.
They had boiled eggs, but no scrambled eggs — maybe because that would’ve required just a bit more effort. Overall, it gave the impression of trying to appear trendy while quietly cutting corners. if it cn be wheeled out of a room that what we got
The breakfast room is nicely styled, but it’s let down by the details. The felt on the pool table is shredded, the plumbing is noisy and should of only int the breakfast room be covered up (you can hear when someone above flushes), and coffee is served in paper cups — . On my first morning, I managed to get a proper mug, but by the second, it was back to takeaway cups. For a breakfast I had to pay extra for, it felt more like a quick hostel setup than a hotel experience.
The Dave red clearly leans into quirky style — and to be fair, it succeeds in that. The building used to be the Communist Party headquarters of Greece, and I really think they should lean into that history more. There’s a massive mural in the breakfast room, but no real explanation or story told about the building’s past. That would’ve been a cool addition — Athens has history at every corner, and this building has a unique one.
The Dave is trying to be hip and alternative — and inside, it mostly succeeds. But the location is grim and the construction quality isn’t there yet. If you’re familiar with Athens and know what to expect, you might manage. But for most travellers, especially first-timers, I’d strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Safer, better alternatives: try Psiri, Koukaki, or Plaka — all still central, with far more charm and far fewer needles.
Bottom line: cool hotel, bad street, broken shower. staying in the Plaka next time.

On the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, in Southeast Europe, is the nation of Greece. It is renowned for its illustrious past, vibrant present, and iconic locations including the Acropolis in Athens, the Palace of Knossos in Crete, and the historic settlement of Delphi. Greece is renowned for its mouthwatering cuisine, which includes meals like moussaka and souvlaki, as well as its stunning islands, like Santorini and Mykonos. Greece has Greek as its official language, and it is a parliamentary republic, and the currency used is the Euro.
In the Attica region of Greece, Athens, the country’s capital and largest city, is home to more than 3 million people. With a history that dates back more than 3,000 years, Athens is one of the oldest towns in all of Europe.
The Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Ancient Agora are just a few of the famous sites that can be seen there. It is noted for its rich cultural heritage. Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates are just a few of the philosophers and well-known thinkers from antiquity who were born and raised in Athens.
Numerous institutions, including the National Archaeological Museum and Acropolis Museum, are also located in the city. Athens is a contemporary city with a thriving arts and entertainment…

Fofi: I have been heavily involved in the music industry for the past 25+ years as a DJ, radio producer, consultant and music journalist in various media outlets, specializing in electronic music. I started DJing professionally when I was 16, so I experienced the difficulties that a girl had first hand, trying to make it in a (local) man-dominated industry, needless to say female DJs were a scarcity at the time — it was so difficult to find a role model to be inspired by, look up to, reassure in some way that there was a future, a possibility for a career out there for me. I had to work extremely hard, rely only on myself, constantly prove that I deserve to be there, belong there over and over (and maybe still do today), until I finally got to a point of being able to exclusively live by my profession.
Greece is quite behind in matters of equality, so at some point I decided that I had to give back, I did not want other people and especially girls having to go through what I went through to get somewhere. So, I created HER project. It was a very lonely ride at first, but luckily I met Virginia at a HER party. I detected her drive, our common values and ethos, which led me to decide to invite her on board. With HER project and our trajectory in music as starting points, we were more than excited to launch the Athenian chapter of shesaid.so in April 2020, elevating our initiatives and efforts on a wider and larger scale, belonging to a like-minded larger and international community.
Virginia: I started DJing and producing quite recently, my journey began in 2018 though I did listen to electronic music before that. One night I met Fofi at a HER party, where we discussed about the concept of HER as a female empowerment initiative in music. I immediately resonated with it, because I had experienced gender biased inequality and sexism from one of my mentors. HER felt like a safe outlet to me, and the fact that I am able to utilize my art to offer a safer space to minorities and do something good for our society is the utmost purpose. From then on I joined HER and along with Fofi we are trying to involve more and more women into it, and raise awareness locally. Until now there isn’t a similar initiative as HER in Greece, neither in electronic music nor in other genres. This is why we also initiated shesaid.so Athens, to reach out to the music industry cluster in general, including other genres and professionals beyond artists only.
We regularly collaborate with Athens Pride, both as representatives of gender minorities, but also as members of the LGBTQI+ community. We are always on the lookout for new, inclusive collaborations. World Pride House in Malmo had an open call for proposals, and we decided to sent in a triptych, which included a livestreamed HER DJ set along with drag performances, a live HER DJ set with VRGN, and a very interesting panel discussion on gender equality in the music industry. We were extremely happy that all of them passed. At the discussion, we are hosting 3 brilliant speakers, event planner and curator, Mirca Lotz, from Germany, psychologist and gender equality advisor, Maria Rodriguez, from Spain and Dina Liberg of shesaid.so Sweden, all of whom gave us their own valuable perspectives on current issues and future actions we could all take.
The Greek scene is buzzing — Athens is becoming a very interesting and intriguing art hub, which has been characterized as the “new Berlin”. However, the music ecosystem, as a whole, is light years away from the Berlin scene. Starting from the lack of basic state support and funds, legislations, unions, statistics, lack of professions such as artist managers, music marketers and communicators, label management, agencies, and more. Needless to say, the music industry is still not as equal and inclusive as it should be with minorities. It was only recently that the issue was even a matter of discussion — shesaid.so Athens organized the FIRST panel that addressed the subject in September 2020.
Representation of women is still not enough and the arguments range from “there aren’t enough women musicians to begin with”, “there is no equality problem, women are the ones who do not want a career in music”, to “currently the top DJs are women, so there is no need for gender equality initiatives” and more.
Greece lacks basic education on what gender stereotypes are, on what ways gender inequality appears, what actions, comments and behaviors spark inequality. It is really funny, until it was not anymore, there are many times that as HER project we have felt that we have to actually convince people here that there is a problem with equality in music.
At the same time, Greece is experiencing a huge societal crisis with a constant and very alarming rise in femicides and gender violence, especially during the pandemic, while the patriarchal system is still strong in our society. Therefore, gender initiatives are needed more than ever, and that does not apply only to music.
On a positive note, more and more people speak up, more women and minorities express their own experiences and there is less fear in sharing one’s own story. In In that sense and in order to shed light on the matter of equality in music, in early 2021 we started a video series called #HERwords, where we invite women DJs and producers to answer a few questions in a 5’ video, sharing their own experiences and advice.
Last but not least, in 2021 the #MeToo movement also made its “debut” in the country — it created a sense of shock in the general public, but at the same time it gave a tremendous feeling of strength, support and hope not only to the victims, who boldly went public with their stories, but also to women and gender minorities in general.
What we have noticed from our collaborations with international artists and professionals, as well as members of the shesaid.so community, is that even though the needs are the same, each country and region has a very different perspective in terms of equality in the music industry, and consequently the respective actions each one takes lead to different sets of milestones we need to reach, so as to achieve working in a safer scene.
Everything begins and ends with education in our opinion. Firstly, we need research and statistics — numbers to show what is really happening in each area and profession, to understand each society and then to set up a localized approach and a clear strategy based on local needs and current social situations.
Raising awareness is also a great starting point, by simply advocating for gender equality and sharing experiences. Digital outlets, like social media, have much power that we can all exploit in that sense. Storytelling has become so much easier now, and if one’s story can affect and change just one more person, then it can create a snowball effect. E.g. Rebekah’s #ForTheMusic campaign sparked discussions and gained followers ranging from artists, to promoters, to clubbers and more. This demonstrated a suppressed need, which surfaced and engaged several professionals in the industry, even though it was a bit strange that it took so long for it to happen — since it was a subject we were all discussing constantly behind the scenes -, but thank the Universe it finally did.
Taking this as a starting point and using the Morillo extremely sad incident as an example, we have to really think why it took so long for mouths to open, even though it was made clear that people knew, why we saw so many people standing by him and not the victims, in the first place, but also after his death. This has to change. We need to start talking more and on a wide scale about safe dancefloors and booths, we need more men allies. We know the problem, we need viable solutions.
Finally, actively supporting communities is also an action we can all take in our daily lives. It is not enough to remain impartial anymore. In order to improve the music industry we need to radically change our daily habits, behaviors, collaborations — we need to actively include minorities in shows, we need to actively protect them and support them, until there is no need to do so anymore.
Fofi: I am an introvert, but very skilled at socializing. Music has always been the means to express my feelings through sound, vibrations and words. I have been doing this since I can remember myself, so it was extremely difficult for me to accept that new “normality”. I hold the longest-living residency at a club in the country, being the resident of Sodade2 for the past 21 years, so I did not only lose my outlet for communication, but also my coexistence with my friends and chosen family. I cannot pick one set as my favourite, I am blessed to have had so many. My latest favourite ones are the b2b sets by me and Virginia at Sodade, when after 4 am we usually set the club on fire, but also our performance as HER project at the first Sonar Athens.
Virginia: What I love about performing live is this non-verbal vibe exchange with the crowd, a give and take, while they are trusting us and letting loose to our music. We have had some of our best nights at a local club where Fofi resides, called Sodade, where we play for hours and experiment with house, electro and techno tracks, mixing genres and classic tracks, too. Also, our set at Sonar Athens is one that I will never forget! The stage, the people, the music, the honor of being part of Sonar, it was truly a night I will never forget.
Virginia: I simply won’t do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable, disrespected, insulted, dehumanized. There is an inner voice, I believe we all have, that reminds us of who we are and warns us when we are about to compromise that. I lately listen to this voice more and more, and it tells me that I am enough for those who respect and enjoy what I have to give, and I would never compromise my values and dignity for anything further.
Fofi: Music is my life, so the way I approach music and my career is actually the way I carry myself in this world: with the utmost care and respect.
The fact that we belong to this amazing global network that consists of exceptional people changing the game in the music industry, coexisting with extraordinary, talented, vigorous, dynamic and driven people, sharing the same mindset and ethos is actually a pure privilege and gift. shesaid.so is shaping the future that transcends the music industry and we want to help in that with all our being.
Virginia: I would pick “Rub” by Peaches. Peaches has been one of my favorite artists since I was young. As a woman, listening to an artist like Peaches, her strength, her expression, her I-dont-give-a-f*ckness, has been truly inspirational. Rub specifically, was published in 2015. It has brilliant lyrics, which are an ode to what is (still) happening today. I would absolutely love to have contributed with techno versions, distortions and beats.
Fofi: “Lifeforms” by Future Sound Of London. I consider it a pure piece of art, a pivotal moment in the electronic music history that shaped the things to come. I think that listening to it, when it was released, I could actually feel my brain being reprogrammed to another dimension. The way they stretched genres and combined ambient with techno is phenomenal. Plus, if I was a part of it, I would actually be in the studio with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and then die of awe silently and peacefully at the corner.
Fofi aka Fo is a leading figure in the Greek dance music scene. She has played at all major clubs in the country, shared the decks with several international DJs and she holds the longest living residency at a club in the country, being a resident of Sodade2 BackStage for the past 20 years.
Brimming with curiosity and passion for electronic music, Virginia aka VRGN is an upcoming talent to watch. Within 2 years she has already played in some of the biggest venues in the Greek scene, sharing the decks with both Greek DJs and international ones such and also performed at the first edition of Sónar festival in Athens, in a B2B session with Fo.

There’s nothing like the open road. Possibilities unfold as the terrain whizzes by your window.
Hailing from the second largest country in the world means that road trips were a rite of passage. There’s a lot of ground to cover in Canada. Packing up and jumping in the car for a long drive to a different destination, through ever-changing seasons is a core memory for me. Driving several hours or even days means that I’ve logged a lot of kilometers on Canadian roads over the years — traversing those expansive landscapes with awe. These road trips stretched into married life for family gatherings, special events, school holidays, and glorious weekends at the cottage.
Our road trips took on a whole new dimension when we moved to Izmir, Türkiye in 2021. The roads no longer looked familiar. We drove with a sense of uncertainty and with, I must say, a slight feeling of trepidation.
Can traffic circle procedures really be that different here? Why is everyone speeding? Will small country lanes based on centuries old trails be wide enough to pass through? What if we get lost and we don’t speak Turkish?
Once we adjusted to the local norms of driving we revelled in the fact that our road…

Hello! I am Panagis Sarantos and this is the story of how the GDSC program and Harokopio University of Athens met each other for the first time — and it was quite a journey!
It all started in the summer of 2021 when I was chosen as Lead. It all happened thanks to Angelika Zaucha, community manager for the GDSC program in Europe.
Here’s an interesting story!
It was the summer of 2021. I was hanging out with my friends on a nice evening in the beautiful city of Athens in Neo Iraklio. While we were talking about our summer plans, I got a notification about a new email. I looked it up and saw the name “Angelika Zaucha” for the first time. She reached me via her personal email to ask me if I would accept the lead position because it was the last day to do that, and they did not get the response from my side.I was positively surprised. I rushed out and found all the other emails that had gone to the spam folder. I finalized the paperwork and became the GDSC Lead & Founder of Harokopio University of Athens (GDSC HUA).So… Thank you, Angelika!
First task, of course, was to form our Core Team. As a student of software engineering, I knew I could reach many developers and people in tech. But I also knew that our Club will need others to help with communications, planning and social media. After making my choice, I came up with these few useful tips on selecting core team members:
I have to say that I didn’t follow all the steps that I mentioned above, but now I know better and you should too.
It’s also important to establish a good relationship with your university and the faculty. Introduce yourself and the program to the authorities. We managed to do it, and our university fully supported all our plans and initiatives. At times it was difficult because of the pandemic, but we managed to overcome any obstacles. For example we managed to do a virtual event about AI & Blockchain for more than 260 unique viewers!
Yes, that’s right. Our first virtual event themed as “Applications of AI & Blockchain in Society & Industry” managed to hit more than 260 unique viewers. I have to tell you that I was really nervous at the beginning. We were live streaming on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms. We had guests from the industry and academia. It was quite a big hit and a pretty good experience for me personally as I got to work on my communication and public speaking skills. I’m always nervous making speeches, especially in front of a big audience. This time, I managed to overcome my fears and really learn a lot.
Solution Challenge, organized yearly by Google Developer Student Clubs, was something I knew I wanted to join right from the start, either by myself or with other members of our chapter.I felt that rush of excitement when I was watching the Top 10 chapters of 2021. I loved the idea of making a positive impact on the target group or the society in general.
We joined the competition as a team and worked hard on our solution. And we did it! Our team called “Bloodcall” got to the Top 10 Finalists of Solution Challenge 2022! It was amazing when we heard the news. Who would have thought, first year of GDSC HUA and we managed to have such a strong representation competing with so many other chapters across the world. Also for the record, we were the only Greek chapter to the Top 10, even the Top 50!
What a journey we had! GDSC was a fun and enriching experience from many different aspects:
I have to say that if you have the time during your time at the university, you should join the program, even if it seems hard at first glance — trust me, the experience is priceless. That was the journey of GDSC HUA on how it was founded and how we did in the first year of our existence. And the journey continues to the present — with new faces, fresh ideas and 2 co-leads. GDSC HUA is still active on campus and in the program. Pretty cool!
From my end, I want to thank all the members of the first core team for the amazing job we did for the chapter while also doing our best as students. Thanks: Manos, Mitsos, Thanos, Nikos, Thanasis, Alexandra, Petros and again Thanos!
I want to thank Harokopio University of Athens for a great cooperation and support. Special thank you goes to our Rector Mrs. Mara Nikolaidou and our Department Head Mr. Thomas Kamalakis.
Lastly I want to congratulate and thank again the Bloodcall team for the amazing job they did. Thank you: Thanasis, George, Stefanos and George.

The 2004 Olympic baseball stadium in Athens is currently not a baseball venue but a soccer venue. I went by in late 2012 and it looked ok. At least they are using it for a sport! See a lot of articles lately saying all the venues are falling apart or abandoned.
There is only one “main” olympic stadium still being used for baseball which is in barcelona host of the 1992 games. The 1996 olympic stadium was Fulton county stadium which was torn down,the 2000 olympic main stadium in Sydney was a showground for cattle and was only a temporary venue for the games. However west of Sydney is the 2nd olympic venue and it has been resurrected by mlb and is used in the abl league. The 2008 wukesong baseball olympic stadium in beijing and both Practice fields were reduced to rubble shortly after the games. So the Olympic baseball stadium in Athens below is still there. Maybe someday it will see a baseball game again.

For the next piece of my President’s Day getaway to Greece and Israel, I flew from Athens International Airport on Aegean to Tel Aviv, giving me a chance to check out the Aegean Business Class Lounge and the Aegean ground experience at its primary hub airport ahead of my flight to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my flight on Emirates from Newark to Athens, the Emirates ground experience at Newark, SAS Lounge at Newark, and stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked Welcome Pickups for my transfer from the InterCon to Athens International Airport (ATH). I scheduled a 2 pm pickup for my flight departing at 5:20 pm. The driver arrived promptly at around 1:45 pm. The ride to Athens airport was smooth and the traffic wasn’t too bad.
I booked the flight using American Express Membership Rewards earned on my American Express Platinum Card transferred to Aeroplan.
I found the check-in area quickly. Aegean had dedicated lines for its business-class customers as well as Star Alliance Gold customers. The line wasn’t too long when I arrived and I was served quickly.
I was not advised of any priority passport control or expedited security lanes for premium passengers. They also didn’t inform me of any lounge access despite its inclusion in my business class ticket.
There was no fast track for immigration, but I made it through pretty quickly. I didn’t initially see the signage for business class security so I got in the main line. When I did eventually notice signage for the business class line, I was already in the general line which was short so I stayed in it and did not move.
Once I cleared the formalities, I was inside the terminal. The Athens airport terminal was nicer and airier than I expected. I quickly found the entrance to the Aegean business lounge and made my way upstairs.
There were several lounges in the same area on a level above the terminal, and the Aegean lounge was clearly signed, but also recognizable from the strong Aegean blue. They are very consistent with their branding.
Curiously, the signs outside did not specifically note that Star Alliance Gold and premium passengers were welcome, as is common at Star Alliance lounges. This lounge, however, is indeed open to them and follows standard Star Alliance lounge access rules.
The lounge is accessed through automated electronic gates where your boarding pass is scanned, though staff was on hand.
Personally, I don’t mind the electronic gates as they allow quick entrance if your boarding pass is coded properly. But I do think being greeted by airline staff and thanked for your business is a nice touch that seems to be going away.
While Athens is Aegean’s primary hub, it’s primarily a medium and short-haul carrier and operates no widebody aircraft so my expectations for this lounge were measured. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the lounge, and the offerings. This is notable since I don’t think Athens sees much connecting traffic either, save for passengers traveling domestically within Greece.
The lounge was a very large space with several areas and buffet stations, with great views of the runway.
The restrooms were hidden in a corner. They were small considering the size of the lounge, though well appointed. Showers did not seem to be available.
Wifi was free and fast. Many seats were available with easy access to outlets which I always appreciate.
There was a large hot beverage area with a massive Nespresso machine and a very solid tea selection. For Americans, there was also drip coffee on hand.
I prefer cold coffee so I would have awarded bonus points if they had iced coffee or cold brew on hand, but that’s very rare in Europe, unfortunately.
A variety of mugs and glassware were available for the hot drinks. The hot beverages area also had various cookies and croissants.
Past the coffee station, there was another buffet area with a variety of pastries, yogurt, and prepared foods.
There were also salads, fresh chocolates, and finger foods. The hot food station had several items, though keeping kosher, I didn’t look too closely.
There was a great selection of beverages and a self-serve collection of wines and spirits. I appreciated that they had Greek beer and wine, and a lounge employee was happy to explain the different Greek beers to me and point me to his favorite.
There was also a selection of various newspapers and magazines, primarily in Greek. It would have been nice to see some English or international offerings though.
Keeping kosher, there was not much I can eat from the buffet, but reviews of the spread from my fellow passengers were pretty positive. I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate ahead of my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv.
Aegean does a reasonably good job with its business lounge, especially given its lack of widebody service. The space is large and comfortable space to relax before your flight. With plenty of seating, fast wifi, and ample food and beverage, it’s pretty solid for a long layover too. While the lack of showers was disappointing, there isn’t much long-haul traffic here so its less of an issue. I would not come early to experience this lounge, but I was very impressed by the offering given Aegean’s foot print.

As a lover of Percy Jackson, visiting Athens has been a dream of mine since I was basically old enough to read. I eventually decided to visit on my own as I had a writing deadline staring me in the face. On one hand, I needed to write thirty-thousand words in a week.
On the other, in that same week, I had found a studio apartment in Athens for £300. Oh! And I only had one week off my typical job. What should I do? I wondered.
Dreams were staring me down on both sides, until I realised, why not do both? So I did, I booked the flights, and off I went, laptop in tow!
I’ve travelled on my own since my first solo-inter-rail trip at seventeen, so this wasn’t new to me, but I was still nervous! As I can imagine you, reading this, would be nervous at the idea of visiting Athens as a solo traveller, especially if you’re an introvert girlie like me.
If you’re thinking about going, I bet the Parthenon is high on your list of attractions, so let’s break it down, because trust me, official guidance on this is confusing!
In this one article, we’ll be covering when you should visit the Parthenon, where to book tickets, as well as some incredible hidden gems at the Parthenon you should keep a look-out…

The Greek economy might be on life support, but at least one group in Athens is making the most of it and clearly thriving: graffiti artists. It has been suggested that Athens might be the best place in the world to be a graffiti artist right now. Or, as one of the practitioners puts it, “a little paradise for the graffiti artists.”
The city is in the middle of a graffiti epidemic. It’s a combination of high youth unemployment and underemployment, a general sense of unrest, and authorities being stretched too thin to do much about it. Frankly, the police have bigger problems. The result is an artistic free-for-all on the city’s streets.
Whether you want to call them vandals or street artists, they’ve been busy. Not all of it is new, of course, but there’s an awful lot of fresh paint adorning the walls downtown in the past five years or so. Shops, homes, bus stops, and pretty much any other wall — except, notably, places that have high security like banks and government buildings (mostly) — are covered in paint. Relatively few walls are spared.
There’s the usual scratchy hit-and-run tagging, but there’s also quite a lot that has taken real thought and effort to pull off. Some of it is youthful rebellion, some of it is political expression, and some of it is art in its purest form. And, of course, it’s constantly morphing, with new paint going over old.
And some of it is quite beautiful. Here’s a small sampling. Credit to the artists, whoever you are.
There’s a very interesting short documentary on graffiti in Athens that shows some of the painters in action. It’s called Alive in the Concrete, and you can watch it online here.

Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Peloponnesian War was the result of years of tension between two of the leading powers in the world of Ancient Greece, Athens, and Sparta. Athens was determined to build a widespread alliance that stretched all corners of the Mediterranean named the Delian League to provide protection against the Persians.
In doing so being the de facto leader they requested tribute to amass naval power and a crew to support it. Sparta was unsettled by this growing alliance and the power it wielded fearing that Athens’s intentions were more imperialistic and less a simple alliance.
By 431 B.C. the reserved feelings that Sparta held could no longer be contained resulting in a multi-decade-long war that ended with a shift of power and the downfall of Greek society. Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and the defeat of imperialistic Athens’s intentions had an ill effect on the Greek world.
The outcome of this war was more than just the decline of the once-great city-state of Athens, the rest of Greece crumbled around it. Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Greek city-states provide us with an interesting look at history, a civilization connected by language and religious belief but separated by geographical nature.
Although each of these city-states remained within close proximity of each other, and some of less geographical obstruction, little alliances were formed. For the majority of their existence, they remained and operated as individual city-states only joining in the defense of one another in times of war to protect the sanctity of their society.
Of the Greek city-states, two of them stood out from the rest and have survived the test of time by both providing their individual contributions to the ancient world which have left a lasting impact on society today. These Greek city-states were Athens and Sparta, two that could not have been more different, and two of whose internal strife would be the ruin of the Greek city-states.
The most distinguished difference between Athens and Sparta was their individual choice of government with each constructed to fit their societal ambitions. Athenians were notably democratic, which objectively defied the Spartan’s oligarchical form of government that supported its militaristic way of life.
Athens obtained this government identity following the Dark Age through the reforms of Solon who first rid the poor from debt slavery to the rich through an act of “disburdenment” a method he proudly boasts about in his poems when talking about mortgaged lands,
“He took away the record-stones that everywhere were planted, Before, Earth was in bondage, now she is free”
and when talking about citizens enslaved in foreign lands that he set free,
“uttering no longer Attic speech, So long and far their wretched wanderings And some who here at home in shameful servitude Were held.”[1]
Solon’s reforms would further establish a method of government that represented the people of Athens with his creation of a multi-tiered government to include a council (boule) of four hundred men who were chosen to hear public matters of the people before the matters were carried on to an elected assembly.[2]
Men like Cleisthenes and Pericles would help Athens to further develop its democratic progression by instilling further reforms that helped to better represent the Athenian citizens becoming an influence to later democratic styles of government to come.
The Spartan government was ruled by the few, a senate or Gerusia made of 30 members who were elected for good conduct and were “absolute masters of the mass of citizens.”[3] In an attempt to avoid corruption between the two kings and 28 council members of the Gerusia, five ephors were elected from the public to serve as moderators, and of whom did not rise within the presence of the kings as the members of the Gerusia did, for they served the people.[4]
This style of government was supportive of the Spartan way of life whose male population entered training for military service at the ripe age of 7 years old and whose service lasted a lifetime. The Spartans thought very highly of their way of life and questioned the rise of Athenian democracy regarding it as weak as evidenced by the words of Lycurgus. When Lycurgus was questioned about democracy in Sparta, he simply answered
“Do you first establish a democracy in your house,”
He further downplays the significance of democracy and further promotes the effectiveness of Sparta’s oligarchy through his analogy of two puppies, both of which were of the same kin but each had notably different upbringings, one was catered to, lived indoors, and was fed regularly, the other hunted and trained in the field.[5]
When Lycurgus later presented the dogs before an assembly of the public he did so by placing food the dogs were accustomed to before them, and as expected the house-trained dog opted for the cheap food while the hunter sought the wild hare in response to these actions Lycurgus said,
“You see, fellow-citizens, that these dogs belong to the same stock, but by virtue of the discipline to which they have been subjected they have turn out utterly different from each other, and you also see that training is more effective than nature for good.”[6]
These societal differences would end up with the two leading Greek city-states entering into an unlikely alliance when the Athenians sought protection against Spartan interference in their own government by promising King Darius of the Persian Empire “earth and water” which was a sign of submission required of all alliance seekers with the Persian Empire, and when Athens did not fulfill their promise King Darius sought retribution against all of Greece.[7]
The outcome of the Persian War was not enough to preserve the unlikely alliance between Athens and Sparta, and for the next several decades they would walk separate paths as equal to their societal differences until they met once again but this time as enemies on the battlefield.
Athenians learned from the Persian War that they were at a financial disadvantage in warfare when compared to the Spartans who were a militaristic state that had an ample supply of endless soldiers, and to the likes of the Persian Empire with a vast network of client states.
When Athens took the helm of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League that sought to protect all of Greece from future Persian invasions from the eastern Mediterranean and in doing so, they adopted the Persian method of funding war knowing that the funding that a single city-state could provide alone was not enough to yield the success they were trying to accomplish so the payment of a fixed tribute from each alliance member annually was necessary.[8]
This decision served to be favorable for the Delian League allowing them to make quick use of the funds in its continuous campaign to expel Persians from harbors across the Aegean Sea, to destroy Persia’s fleet, and to liberate Ionia’s poleis.[9]
This financial arrangement would prove to be even more favorable to the Athenians when they undermined other league members to create an Athenian Empire to which they were subject and their financial contributions allowed the funding of elite Athenian sailors and hoplites who could endure campaigns and sieges lasting from a few months to a few years.[10]
Sparta, who was the original intended leader of the alliance that became the Delian League slipped back into its isolationistic state shortly after its formation and after Sparta was replaced as its leader by Athens. Even from Sparta’s state of isolation, Sparta watched on as Athens gained momentum in its rise of becoming an empire and its ascendance into the Golden Age afforded by the funds of the Delian League’s tributes. As this unfolded Sparta’s fear of an Athenian shift into imperialism heightened, and with justification.
Athens’s transformation into an imperialistic empire is best described by a certain characteristic quality that further distinguished itself from its closest competition the Spartans. This quality is known as “daring” and encompasses Athens’s traits of restlessness and expansionism in its rise to power and is best described by Thucydides in his recording of Pericles’ Funeral Oration that occurred during the Peloponnesian War where he records Pericles’s attention to the sacrifices made by fallen Athenians whose courage, virtue, and “daring” should be a model for Athenians who have survived for it has allowed Athens to compel every sea and every land to yield to their “daring” enabling them to be immortalized through monuments everywhere of themselves.[11]
Furthermore, Athenian “daring” is a catalyst for a theory that was composed by Thucydides that he believes explains the inevitable war that happened between Athens and Sparta. This theory is the theory of Hegemonic War.
Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War is a concept that he believed to be as true as human nature and one that is to be repeated throughout all of human history with one civilization driven by three fundamental influences: interest, pride, and fear, to advance its position of wealth and power until another civilization of the same interests intervenes in an attempt to stop them.[12]
Athens’s use of its position within the Delian League as a vessel in its ascendance to power saw the city-state grow ruthless, and become an aggressive bully when its authoritative role was challenged by league members who no longer sought an alliance with them. This issue was not self-contained and true to Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War when Athens and Sparta butted heads when Athens failed to resolve conflicts of interest that created issues with members of Sparta’s own alliance, the Peloponnesian League, leading to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.
In short, the cause of the Peloponnesian War can be attributed to Athenian’s “daring,” its own justification for imperialism, and Athens’s interference in the Peloponnesian Leagues matters. Sparta tried to settle conflicts of interest between Athens and its own league the Peloponnesian League through questionable measures when it threatened the act of war against Athens and its allies if Athens did withdraw its siege of Potidaea, a rebelling member of the Delian League with connection to Corinth of the Peloponnesian League, and abstain from its imposed economic sanctions against the Megareans in all ports within the Athenian dominion, which Athens saw justification for doing because they had tilled holy grounds and received revolted Athenian slaves.[13]
Additionally, Sparta’s stern ultimatum to the Athenians was heavily influenced by one of its strongest allies in the Peloponnesian League, Corinth, who urged the Spartans to a speedy intervention to the injustices being carried out by Athens, or Corinth itself and other Peloponnesian League members would seek a new alliance to join.[14]
Moreover, Athens’s refusal to meet the terms of Sparta’s ultimatum resulted in a three-decade-long war that saw Sparta fight against the injustices of Athenian Imperialism which they successfully accomplished by standing as victors at the end of the war. However, the war had adverse actions on the Greek city-states as a whole, many fell into economic hardships as a result of the war, and some were influenced by the two prominent Greek city-states of opposing governments to carry out civil conflict against their own people.
The Golden Era of Athens and its influence on the ancient world ended, and the shift of power to Sparta as the leading Greek city-state proved to be an utter failure, as previous foreshadowed in its leading role as a member of the what became the Delian League, resulting in years of conflict to follow allowing the Greeks to become susceptible to its latter absorption into the Macedonian Empire.
Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and its overnight ascendance to hegemony over Greece proved to have detrimental consequences for all of the city-states.
Sparta, as Athens did before them, flexed its power throughout Greece proving to be just as bad or even worse for the Greek people than Athens was before them as evidenced by the choice of Sparta’s former allies aligning themselves with Athens in an attempt to hinder its control. Thriving in victory Sparta promoted Admiral Lysander to carry out an instilled aggressive policy that reformed city-state governments throughout Greece by placing harmosts (military governors) who forcibly established oligarchies as well as required tribute from all those they had conquered even though before feeling such power they had not even used coined money but now benefitted from the annual tribute of more than a thousand subjects.[15]
In response to these actions and backed by Persian money an alliance was formed between Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes who swore to defeat Sparta.[16] This conflict was the Corinthian War (395–387 B.C.).
The Corinthian War finished in a similar fashion to the Peloponnesian War with Sparta standing in victory benefiting from late financial support from Persia, when Persia switched sides leaving behind its original alliance with Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes. This would not be the final conflict between the Greek city-states in their pursuit of hegemony status, alliances would be reformed and reconstructed, and the title of hegemony would be passed amongst city-states until the mid-fourth century B.C. During this period of time, the Spartans suffered a dreadful defeat at the hands of the Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra (471 B.C.) that halted Sparta’s reign of power.[17]
This nearly century-long struggle to obtain the status of hegemony left adverse actions among the Greek city-states. The nearly century-long constant warring exhausted resources, depleted civilizations, and rendered each city-state barely capable of maintaining its own state, each becoming susceptible to rising power to the North.
The Macedonians under the leadership of King Philip II took advantage of the exhausted Greek city-states in pursuit of gaining hegemony status for his growing empire with little resistance to his efforts besides a single conflict against Athens and Thebes in 338 B.C. known as the Battle of Chaeronea. Athens and Thebes refused to yield to King Philip and the Macedonians like northern Greek city-states had done before them because as explained by the Athenian orator Demosthenes the Macedonians were not Greek or even related to the Greeks and not even a barbarian from an honorable place of mention so submitting to them was insulting to the sanctity of Greece.[18]
The defeat of Athens and Thebes by Macedonia proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Greek power. Even though they retained a sense of freedom, any influence the Greek people once held on the Ancient World through their acts of politics and foreign policy completely ceased to exist, now they were subjects to the Macedonian Empire.
The outcome of the Persian War set the scene for the inevitable war between two of the greatest Greek city-states of their time, Athens, and Sparta. Following the war, Athens accepted a position as leader of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League, with great ambitions to rid the Persian Empire from the east Mediterranean and the rest of Greece.
They were successful, to say the least, but with a stronghold on this great power, their ambitions turned personal. As the Spartans watched on from isolation following the Persian War, Athens used the Delian League for its own personal gain, in the hold of a massive and lethal navy, and with ample funds supplied by Greek city-state tributes they grew into a formidable empire.
Athens’s growth did not end there, soon they turned imperialistic, whether it was for Sparta’s own personal feelings of disdain for Athens, or its urge to protect Greece, the two city-states met with war in 431 B.C. The results of the Peloponnesian War would prove to yield irrevocable and unintentional consequences when the victor proved to be just as bad as the perceived threat they dethroned.
Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain
Centuries ago, a radiant jewel of civilization — Athens — crumbled. Not merely under the weight of Spartan swords, but under the erosion of reason, the rise of demagogues, and the silencing of truth.
The Peloponnesian War wasn’t just a historical battle. It was the death knell of a civilization that gave the world democracy, philosophy, and artistic brilliance — and then extinguished its light.
Today, as we scroll through headlines filled with disinformation, political chaos, and moral exhaustion, one can’t help but wonder:
Are we living through our own Peloponnesian moment?
The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) pitted the democratic city-state of Athens against the oligarchic city-state of Sparta in a 27-year conflict that decimated both.
Athens, confident in its intellect and naval prowess, made a series of hubristic miscalculations. It overreached, misled by populist leaders and reckless ambition, ultimately losing the war and itself.
The fall of Athens didn’t just shake the Greek world. It produced a spiritual and philosophical crisis that gave rise to one of history’s most powerful responses: the life and death of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato.
Socrates — a soldier-turned-philosopher — walked the streets of Athens, challenging assumptions, confronting power, and questioning the nature of justice, truth, and virtue.
He didn’t write. He asked.
And in a society growing fragile under the weight of war and rhetoric, questions became dangerous.
In 399 BCE, Athens condemned him to death. His student, Plato, watched his mentor die — and with that, watched the Athenian soul fracture.
Plato didn’t just mourn Socrates. He responded with a blueprint for a better world.
In The Republic, he paints a chilling portrait of democratic decay: how freedom becomes license, how public opinion overrides wisdom, and how a desire for equality can spiral into tyranny.
His solution? A society governed not by the loudest, but the wisest philosopher-kings trained in truth, detached from greed, and committed to justice.
Now, let’s fast forward 2,500 years.
Across nations, we see strongmen rising, liberties shrinking, and democracy faltering under the same forces that once undid Athens.
We call it progress. But in the quiet moments, history whispers a warning.
Plato foresaw the cycle of governance:
We are, arguably, at the fragile edge between stages four and five.
And the pattern? It’s not new. It’s timeless.
If Athens fell — and from its ashes, philosophy rose — what must we do to avoid repeating that collapse?
Here’s what the legacy of Socrates and Plato implores us to reclaim:
“The unexamined life is not worth living.” — Socrates But perhaps more urgently today: “The unexamined society is not worth sustaining.”
Athens gave us the tools to think. But when it stopped thinking, it destroyed itself.
Today, we possess far greater power — nuclear, digital, economic — but not necessarily greater wisdom.
If we let emotion eclipse reason, let division replace dialogue, and let power overpower truth, then we will fall, not because we were unaware, but because we were indifferent.
So ask yourself:
Are we the next Athens? Or will we, finally, choose a wiser path?

Thought is Western, is it not?
Then, why does the sun rise from the East?
Imminently, all the frauds I have been taught
Revealed themselves to be colonial beasts.
The Secularism of God.
In a house of lavish marble.
What once was a library has turned into the fury of charcoal.
You were my renaissance.
I could feel my heart’s pace again beat.
Knowledge may be bronze,
But you were the heart that gold breeds.
You were my revelation.
The final thread of hope in the inner child of mine.
You were my salvation.
My last supper; my bread, my olives, my wine.
You healed my wounded wings,
You watered my dying tree.
Dethroned the heartless kings
That held the ropes to execute me.
Knowledge may give power,
But you make me weak.
At once, let me in this hour
Dare to write rather than speak.
You were the art pieces I always believed awaited my thoughts.
The righteous pillars beneath all of my frauds.
The School of Athens has nothing on the stairs of Fisk.
None of the curls, the lace, the laughter, the hugs, the mist.
None of the empathetic brilliance wrapped up in a warm scarf of linen.
Hypatia’s eyes scream, “Raphael, where are the women?”
The grace I have been destined,
The bonds I have been foretold.
The youth of youths,
Only the blessed get old.
Philosophers have nothing on my friends.
None of the torture, the light, the breeze, the love, the bliss.
Athens has nothing on Beirut.
Mosque to church is holy palmer’s kiss.
Love imitates art, life imitates you.
Pieces of my heart, who else would I write to?

The sun, a dying ember in the twilight, cast long shadows across the Athenian marketplace. Among the stalls of olives and sandals, Socrates, his brow etched with the wrinkles of a thousand dialogues, sat hunched on a block of worn stone. His eyes, like pools of wisdom, watched the bustling throng, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames of oil lamps.
“Friend,” rasped a voice from behind, “the shadows grow long. What truths do you glean from this day?”
Socrates turned to see Aristotle, his beard a silver cascade down his chest, his gaze sharp as a polished stylus.
“The dance of life, dear friend,” Socrates replied, “a waltz of appetites and aspirations. We spin on a spectrum, woven of threads both base and divine — the hunger for sustenance, the yearning for knowledge, the sting of guilt, the glimmer of hope.”
He gestured to a young woman haggling over a basket of figs, her eyes bright with cunning, her smile tinged with shame. “In her, the primal barter, the dance of need and debt. Money, a cold coin, echoes the ancient whisper of sacrifice, the price we pay for survival, for power, for absolution.”
He pointed to a group of men debating philosophy under the olive trees, their voices rising in passionate waves. “And here, the fire of the mind, the struggle to transcend the limitations of flesh. They seek answers in the stars, meaning in the dust, a testament to our insatiable hunger for significance, our defiance against the indifferent abyss of oblivion.”
Aristotle nodded, his voice deep as the Aegean. “Yet, even in the shadows, there flickers a light. Ritual, the heartbeat of community, binds us together in the face of the unknown. In shared sacrifice, in the rhythm of chanted prayers, we find solace, strength, a sense of purpose that transcends the individual.”
He looked towards the temple on the hill, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. “But the shadows grow, Socrates. The marketplace, once vibrant with the hum of shared stories, now echoes with the click of screens, each a window to a solitary universe. The third space, the crucible of connection, fades, replaced by the atomization of the digital.”
Socrates sighed, a rumble in his chest. “A new dawn approaches, friend, a dawn where ghosts of information dance in the ether, and the stories we tell ourselves become the scaffolding of our reality. We must choose, then, with clear eyes and open hearts. Will we build walls of data, fortresses of self, or will we weave tapestries of shared experience, where the echoes of laughter mingle with the whispers of wisdom, and the spark of humanity burns bright in the face of the coming night?”
The two figures fell silent, their words hanging heavy in the twilight air. The marketplace hummed on, oblivious to their philosophical dance. But in the quiet space between their thoughts, a seed of possibility was sown, a glimmer of hope that perhaps, even in the face of shadows and screens, the story of humanity was far from over.
The stars began to prick the darkening canvas of the sky, each a tiny eye watching the ancient dance unfold. And in the murmur of the wind, a whisper echoed, a question not just for Socrates and Aristotle, but for all of us: what story will we write with our actions, thoughts and intentions when none concord?
In the poisoned vineyard of the web, nightshade and hemlock intertwine, their bitter fruit cultivated by a dark alliance: demagogues, serpents with forked tongues, weaving fear and falsehood, and aristocrats, spiders of silver and silk, manipulating the strings of information. These power figures, fueled by an insatiable hunger for control, are the origin of a festering inequality, where shadows of misinformation stretch long and menacing.
Children, once innocent buds sprouting in the communal garden, are twisted into warped reflections of the past. Demagogues, like cruel gardeners, graft onto them the bitter fruits of division and hate, while aristocrats, like watchful vultures, prey on their vulnerability. Escape from this suffocating garden becomes a desperate scramble for a centralized haven, a fortress of ritual and symbolic power, built not on shared values, but on the fear of the encroaching darkness.
The sun of communal ritual, once a beacon of unity, casts a dwindling light. Its dawn, a sinful song and story, faded with the rise of individualism, replaced by the harsh neon glare of screens, each a solitary window to a curated universe. Dusk descends, painted in the muted tones of isolation, where third spaces, once bustling havens of connection, lie fallow, echoing with the hollow hum of digital ghosts.
But even in the eclipse of community, there glimmers a stubborn hope. Seeds of resistance, dormant but waiting, stir beneath the poisoned soil. In the quiet defiance of shared laughter, in the whispered acts of kindness, in the flickering flames of shared stories, lies the potential for a new dawn. A dawn where technology, wielded not as a weapon of exclusion, but as a bridge of connection, allows for the reemergence of communal ritual, not as a rigid fortress, but as a vibrant tent, open to all, where diverse voices orchestrate a symphony of shared humanity abilities.
This is the challenge before us: to reclaim the web from the poisoners, to nurture the seeds of connection, and to rediscover the lost art of ritual, not as a tool of control, but as a celebration of our shared existence. This is the path to escape the garden of shadows, to break free from the digital atomization, and to step into the sunlit clearing of a future where community, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes of isolation, its wings strong and vibrant, casting a benevolent shade on the children of tomorrow.
The Athenian sun beat down on the bustling agora, its rays glinting off olives piled high on a stall. Socrates, sandals dusty and brow furrowed, leaned against the fragrant wood, a gadfly amidst the buzzing marketplace. Aristotle, eyes keen and gait confident, strode towards him, a predator seeking intellectual prey.
“Ah, Aristotle!” Socrates’ voice, sharp as Attic salt, sliced through the cacophony. “Come to barter insights, like merchants haggling over your precious olives?”
Aristotle chuckled, a deep rumble that resonated with the city’s heartbeat. “Indeed, Socrates. My thirst for knowledge burns as bright as this midday sun. Today, I seek your scalpel of logic to dissect the enigma of humanity. Tell me, is it true that death’s denial fuels our cultural ascent?”
Socrates’ beard twitched as he considered. “Hmm, a bold claim, my friend! Is it not fear, rather, that drives us to carve rituals from the raw stone of existence? These sacrifices, offerings to appease the unseen, are they not testaments to our primitive dread of oblivion?”
Aristotle’s eyes glinted like polished bronze. “But does not this very struggle against annihilation spark the flame of ingenuity? Look how technics, born from ritual, crafts tools not just for survival, but for creation! In this ‘Ritual World,’ as you call it, does not sacrifice, the conscious giving, pave the path to something grander?”
Socrates’ hand darted out, intercepting a passing fly. “I concede, dear Aristotle, ingenuity dances alongside fear. Yet, even your grand tapestry of cultural transcendence, is it not woven with threads of guilt and the sting of our limitations? Money, that cold symbol of debt and desire, does it not resonate with our primal shame, pushing us towards both heroism and the gnawing need for expiation?”
Aristotle nodded, a wry smile playing on his lips. “True, the clink of coins echoes with both ambition and regret. But is it not through this very tension, this economic pulse, that the Ritual World thrives? Power and expiation, like two sides of the same coin, fuel both the triumphs of heroes and the humbling rituals of forgiveness.”
“So, we paint different facets of the same diamond, Aristotle,” Socrates quipped, a playful glint in his eyes. “You, the grand architect of systems, see culture as a cosmic dance against extinction. I, the gadfly, poke at the underbelly, revealing the raw nerves of guilt and longing that drive us.”
Aristotle’s hand traced the lines on a nearby olive. “Yet, in our contrasting melodies, is there not a harmony? Your dissection lays bare the human condition, while my synthesis offers a broader canvas. Together, do we not illuminate the full spectrum of this curious journey, from dust to aspirations?”
Socrates’ voice, gravelly yet warm, filled the air. “Indeed, friend. In this marketplace of ideas, our voices intertwine, a chorus echoing across the ages. For the struggle for meaning, for transcendence, is woven into the very fabric of our being. And in this shared pursuit, the sting of doubt and the glimmer of hope become the rhythm of our existence.”
The sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched across the marketplace. Socrates and Aristotle, their voices blending, continued their philosophical duet, a dance of logic and wonder marveling at the mystery in the vibrant heart of Athens.
This is the story we must write, not with nightshade and hemlock, but with courage, compassion, and the enduring human spirit. For in the end, it is not walls that define us, but the echoes of shared laughter, the warmth of a helping hand, and the stories that bind us together under the vast, starlit sky.

The heart of Athens’ historic center is experiencing a revival. The 27-acre district is bounded by three of Athens’ most historic squares: Syntagma, Ommonia, and Monistraki. The Commercial Triangle, locally referred to as “Trigono,” is a working district, with commercial activity dating back to the 19th century.
Despite its historic and geographic significance, the neighborhood fell into disrepair in the 1980s. As a result, many buildings were vacated. By 2016, 17% of ground floor and 45% of upper floor spaces were vacant, while a survey of shopkeepers in the area found that 50–70% believed graffiti, lack of cleanliness, and illegal parking were serious issues. While there were pockets of economic activity, the neighborhood was not pedestrian-friendly and it was struggling to attract new investment.
As a city emerging from an eight-year crisis, Athens is making real progress in charting a new future. Under the leadership of Mayor Giorgos Kaminis, the city is employing creative solutions to improve quality of life, and his focus on cultivating community pride and optimism is making a real impact. One of his cornerstone projects has been the revitalization of the Trigono neighborhood.
Since 2015, Bloomberg Associates has worked with Mayor Kaminis to advance his priority projects by sharing expertise from the global network of client cities. Bloomberg Associates is the international, philanthropic consulting arm of Bloomberg Philanthropies, providing select mayors and city governments with custom consultation and mentorship.
This episode features conversations with Alexandros Kambouroglou, the Executive Director of the Athens Partnership, and Elina Dallas, the Project Manager for the Trigono program. Jake Elder of Bloomberg Associates Sustainability Team joined them in Athens.

Athens is often hailed as the birthplace of democracy. But Athens was also the birthplace of gay culture. Openly practiced and celebrated, homosexuality was part of the social fabric of ancient Athens. Today, the Greek capital remains a very gay-friendly city, with countless gay and lesbian bars, many openly gay celebrities, and a vibrant LGBTQI+ community. Athens Pride, the country’s biggest festival of diversity, is held every June.
Just like in every vibrant European city, Athens can be a handful for a first-time visitor. Here’s all the LGBTQI+ legalities you’ll need to know and all the organizations you’ll may have to contact, while in Athens.
Legal Status on discrimination
In Greece there are laws prohibiting discrimination based on sex, race, age, or sexual orientation; civil unions are legal, but not full-fledged same-sex marriages; a status many government officials say will soon change. The Mayor of Athens has openly supported same-sex marriages and many couples wait for it.
Homophobia
There has been a growing concern over homophobia, due to the rise of the far right in Greece because of the crisis. Although that was true, homophobic incidents are rare. The biggest opposition to lgbtqi+ issues is held by a few priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, who are by and large regarded as “relics” by most Greeks, who see the world change for the better. There have been fewer attacks on gay couples in the last 5 years, than there are fingers in one’s hand. Athenians don’t tolerate intolerance.
LGBTQI+ Organizations
There are many organizations for the LGBTQI+s of Greece and the vast majority of them is headquartered in Athens. OLKE is the most prominent one, pushing out the non-discriminatory agenda. For the young crowd, Colour Youth is a fresh and very active organization (famous for its parties) that acts more as a community of young lgbtqi+ people who want to have fun and claim their rights, than an old school non-profit organization. Positive Voice welcomes HIV positive people, and friends, who wish to stand for their community and help in any way they can towards a zero infections day. Athens CheckPoint is an NGO that offers quick and reliable HIV blood checks for free. It’s located near Monastiraki Square (Metro Line 1&3) and have very discreet staff.
Gay Publications
The oldest and most read LGBTQI+ publication in Athens is Antivirus Magazine, a Greek speaking, bi-monthly free press, that for over a decade chronicles the news and events of the gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer and intersex community of Athens and Greece. You’ll find it at bars, universities, hot-dog joints and many other places that support the equal-rights movement. One step further, Colourful Planet is a bookshop-cafe that has also turned into a publishing house. Young (or just new) LGBTQI+ writers are welcome here, to find a publishing outlet for their voice to be heard.
The Greek Capital is always ready for big colourful parades and out festivals! For over a decade Athens hosts one of the most dynamically growing Prides in Europe every June and the last couple of years, the Outview Festival of Athens draws international attention with its screenings and guests!
Athens Pride
The City of Athens wears its rainbow colours with pride every year, on the second Saturday of June, at Syntagma (it used to be held in Klafthmonos Square, but now it moved to the city’s main square). With countless events and parties leading up to the big parade, Athens Pride has developed to one of the most formidable in Europe. It’s sponsored by the City of Athens and it’s a custom for the parade to start on the Athens Mayor’s mark! It was in 2004 that the first Gay Pride was held and since then, more and more people and corporations support it and attend to its events. Nowadays it’s lauded as one of the most dynamically growing prides in the western world.
Outview Festival
Athens annual Queer Film Festival, although relatively new, has gained extreme momentum and is already included in the most important LGBTQI+ events and Cinema Festivals of the Country. Every year, for a week in May, a downtown cinema theatre (usually the state-owned Greek Film Archive’s cinema) hosts an international festival celebrating movies from all over the world, made by LGBTQI+ creators or with a strong LGBTQI+ theme. Directors, actors, screenwriters and more attend the festival, that also organizes forums and workshops for those who wish to learn more about queer cinema.
Athens is notorious for its nightlife! Expect even more eleganza extravaganza at the city’s many LGBTQI+ clubs and pubs! And not just for the Dancing Queens! LGBTQI+ travellers will feel welcome to any cafe and bar of Athens, as the young and hip crowd is always friendly and up for a talk. For those who love to show their dancing skills, the Athenian soundtrack is a loud playlist for every taste! Disco divas, pop guilty pleasures, progressive electronica, Greek popular music? You name it! There is more than meets the eye in those small gay and lesbian bars.
Keramikos
Usually referred to as “Gazi”, the Keramikos area, at the Keramikos Metro Line 3 station, plays host to the most famous gay clubs in Greece. Some have over a decade of constant operation and are still as popular as ever! Open seven nights a week, the party never stops here, for every lgbtqi+ night owl. Bears, next door guys and gals, fashion forward people, trendy celebrities are among the ones joining in the fun at Gazi. Out for a cocktail, a beer or just a glass of wine, whatever someone looks for, will find it here, including many hot Greeks! The square at the centre of Gazi area also has many cafes, burger joints, vromiko sandwich places and even a pasta to go, cause gay or straight, at the end of a long night out, you’ll want something to sink your teeth into.
Historical Centre
If you wish to start the night earlier, you could visit the Agias Eirinis square; it’s full of the hip “in crowd” having coffee, a snack or their first drinks, at the many beautiful cafe/bars around. A relatively recent Athenian highlight, the square is now considered the downtown meeting point and place to be for all aspiring fashionistas. One can sit at its numerous gay-friendly places and read a book, consult a map, or simply watch the passerby's. In the paved streets from Monastiraki to Syntagma, you’ll find the rainbow heart of Athens beating, until the sun comes up in the morning.
Victoria Square
Not hip, nor cool, the area around Victoria station (Metro Line 1) was once the go-to-place for gays, when there was no concept of equal rights movement, and many people were still in the closet. The many hidden bars gained fame back then, but also a devoted following, so it’s no surprise that some have remained, although they’re now more of “boy bars”. Many immigrants flock to these places, since most live in the area of Victoria, giving these gay bars a quite different and unique oriental attitude.
Koukles
Koukles deserves a chapter on its own. Founded in 1994, the club originally aimed at helping Drag Queens find a place to express themselves. But as we all know if you put many Drag Queens together the results are either Disastrous or Fabulous! At Koukles, fabulousness is mandatory! While many clubs offer Drag Shows (like BeQueer ), in Koukles they're on every night! Fierce and Fun take central stage as International Divas fight for the spotlight and our applause. Word of wisdom: Make reservations if you want to get a table!
How can one not fall in love with Athens? The Acropolis, the Nightlife, the Food, the Sun, the Sea. Would you think that only in Mykonos you’d find gay beaches in Greece? Think again! Athens will make you want to “Shante -Stay!” all year round! Pack your sexiest swimwear, cause in Athens, you’re going to need it! Being a stone-throw away from the sea, the city serves as the perfect place to combine sightseeing and summer fun!
Limanakia
Just like there is no such thing as a gay island, but then, there’s Mykonos, there is no such thing as a gay beach, but then there’s Limanakia. Easily accessible by bus or car, right before the coastal suburb of Varkiza, Limanakia is a rocky beach that started off as a nudist beach but evolved into a semi-nude gay beach. Take a dive at the cool deep blue waters and be careful when you walk of the rock, as it gets slippery. Here you’ll find many singles trying to hook-up and couples wanting to get intimate, or simply looking for a tan without swimsuit markings. The atmosphere gets very flirty during sunset when the sun dives in the Saronic waters.
Mavro Lithari
Following the road to Sounio, a few kilometers before the Temple of Poseidon, you’ll find not one, but three small gulfs that welcome gays! Right at the 48 km of the road you’ll come across three small gulfs that are the hotspot of hip people! A lovely mix of Athenians wishing to relax and enjoy a beer under the sun, without over-thinking or feeling ashamed to go skinny dipping, usually sunbathes here; there’s also a canteen to one of the rocky gulfs, which serves coffees and snacks to-go, an always important aspect to anything Greek.
Kakia Skala
Before millions of people lived in Athens, when its suburbs were nothing more than small villages, western Attika used to go to Kineta for a quick swim. White pebbled beaches and calm waters made a perfect getaway during a sweltering day. But then the sudden overpopulation of Athens altered everything, industrializing a big part of Attika, with a huge effect on sea pollution. Since then, many years have passed and the beaches from Kakia Skala all the way to Kineta welcome again Athenians during sizzling summer days. Somewhere well hidden, under the National Highway that passes through, lies a small rocky beach with pebbles that is for nudists and gays.
Today the Greek capital is a very gay-friendly destination, hosting the biggest Pride Parade in the country and offering numerous queer activities! However, the Athenian history offers an abundance of queer cultural moments. Homosexuality was openly practiced, often with official sanction, until Christianity took over. Plus: Plato’s famous Symposium takes place in the house of Agathon, a gay Athenian tragic poet who was the lifelong companion of Pausanias, when he receives a prize for his first tragedy.

At the entrance to the Acropolis, there is a plaque that commemorates Athens’ contributions to Western civilisation. The city has had an outsized impact in shaping the trajectory of modern democracy, philosophy, architecture, and drama, and I was excited to explore the place at the centre of it all: the Acropolis.
My day started at 9am after a quick breakfast of cold cuts and fresh fruit at the hostel. I had opted for a guided tour of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Acropolis Museum, and I met my guide and our small group at the Acropolis metro station. Though I did spot a number of Indians on my flight to Athens yesterday, my group were all Americans and Canadians, with I being the sole representative from the eastern hemisphere.
Our guide had warned us that its best that we stay together and start the tour early, as three cruise ships had docked at Piraeus the previous day, and they would all descend on the Acropolis today, leading it to be an extremely crowded day to explore. By the time we reached the Acropolis, the crowds had started to thicken, with it being almost impossible to not be accosted by the sea of humanity at every turn.
The term Acropolis is from the Greek words akron, meaning highest point, and polis, meaning city. Though the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, it was Pericles who coordinated the construction of the buildings that the area is famous for today: the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Over the years, countless wars and unthinkable acts of destruction, coupled with quests for religious and political hegemony have seriously damaged these magnificent structures, yet they still stand majestically over the city of Athens to tell their tale.
The Acropolis, though in reality (that honour goes to Lycabettus Hill, which I visited later) not the highest point of the city, rises 150m above the sea level, offering its occupants a commanding view of the city and its surroundings. On a clear day, one can see all the way to the port of Piraeus, enabling the rulers to have enough time to scramble resources in the case of an invasion. The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta was primarily a battle for maritime control, as the victor of the war was guaranteed control over crucial maritime routes across the Mediterranean Sea. As my flight was descending onto the tarmac of Athens’ airport yesterday, I did notice the lack of vegetation across the terrain — the hills are pockmarked with shrub vegetation and the occasional olive tree, a contrast from the lush green vegetation that I’m used to back home in Kerala. Athens’ maritime prowess was thus a result of sheer necessity — the poor soil of the Attica region meant that the city’s only route to power and wealth was overseas trade, making a significant maritime presence key to their domination.
Our first stop on the tour was the Theatre of Dionysus, built between the fourth and the fifth century BC. Walking amidst its ruins, I was reminded of the contribution of the Greek tragedians: Sophocles, Euripedes, and Aesychlus, all of whom staged plays at this very theatre. There is also significant evidence to show that Aristophanes, the Father of Comedy, staged his play The Clouds at the very same venue, which eventually led to the trial and the subsequent condemning to death of Socrates. Artistic expression has always played an important role in maintaining the balance of power in society, and we will always have the great Greek playwrights to thank for their contributions.
A narrow path carved onto the slopes of the hill is the only way up and down the Acropolis, and as time passed by, the entire route became crowded with tourists. In most cities in Europe, over-tourism has become an increasing concern, with Athens being no exception. Our group slowly made way to the top, with the magnificent edifice of the Parthenon slowly coming into view. A former temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is the definitive epitome of Greek architecture, an enduring symbol of democracy and Western civilisation.
Tired from climbing the modest hill in the Athenian summer, we gathered under the shade of an olive tree for some respite, when my eye caught sight of a plaque detailing the foundation myth of the city of Athens. According to Greek mythology, both Poseidon and Athena wanted to be the patron deity of the city, and with Zeus being unable to resolve the conflict, the competing Gods decided to have a contest and leave it to the citizens of the city to decide which gift was better than the other. Poseidon struck his spear to the ground and a spring sprang up, and Athena gave birth from the ground to a magnificent olive tree. The water from the spring was salty and not very useful, on the other hand, the olive tree provided the citizens with food, shade, oil, and wood, and the city was named after Athena, who then became the protector of this city, which would grow to become the most powerful city in all of Greece.
The Parthenon is a stunning example of Greek architecture, with architectural flourishes adorning all of its surfaces. Only a few of the frieze, mentopes, and pediments, which topped its magnificent Doric columns, now stand, with a few of them now in the Acropolis Museum, and the remaining, unsurprisingly, now housed in the British Museum in London, carefully smuggled out of then Ottoman Greece, by British nobleman and diplomat Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin. The Elgin Marbles, as they are now called, are the Greek kohinoor, and the Greek have also been lobbying the hallways of Whitehall for its repatriation.
We then made our way back down to head to the last stop for the day: the Acropolis Museum. A magnificent structure of glass and steel, the museum houses remnants excavated from the neighbourhood surrounding the Acropolis. Consisting of three levels, the museum is a captivating blend of ancient and modern. The ground level showcases an impressive collection of ancient statues, excavated from the numerous sanctuaries that dotted the area. However, the star of the museum is undoubtedly the Parthenon Gallery, a breathtaking glass atrium constructed in the same dimensions as the Parthenon itself. The gallery holds the famous Parthenon frieze, the metopes, and the pediments, all arranged to mirror their original positions on the Parthenon. During earlier requests to the British for the return of the Elgin Marbles, the British Government made the claim that the Greeks had “no suitable location where they could be displayed”, and the creation of the Acropolis Museum aims to remedy this shortcoming in the Greek request for reattribution.
Our tour ended at 2pm and I felt drawn to explore more of the city’s historic charm. I began by strolling through Makrigianni’s streets and towards Plaka. As I walked the quiet streets of Plaka, the calmness of Athens became evident as birdsong filled the air, a rare sound in a bustling city. After a quick lunch of a gyro, I headed to the Athens National Garden, a green space in the heart of the city. Nestled between the park and the magnificent Hadrian’s Temple of Olympian Zeus is the Zappeion, a palatial building built for the Olympic Games. Named after Evangelos Zappas, one of the pioneers of the modern Olympic Games, it is now used for meetings and ceremonies and holds a place in history as the site where Greece’s ascension to the Eurozone was signed in May 1979.
As I wrapped up my explorations for the day, I found myself ruminating over the city’s striking blend of the old and the new, a harmonious co-existence of historical legacy and contemporary vibrance. Athens is a city that has continued to evolve without losing sight of its illustrious past, and as I continue my journey deeper into this gorgeous city, I’m reminded that every step taken in Athens is a step through time, an experience that only few other cities in the world can provide.

“If Athens shall appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.” — Pericles
During our recent family holiday in Greece in May 2023, we had the incredible opportunity to explore the ancient sites of Athens.
While the Acropolis and the iconic Parthenon were undoubtedly awe-inspiring, it was our visit to the Ancient Agora that truly transported us back in time. It provided us with a genuine glimpse into ancient Athenian life.
“The Ancient Agora of Athens is an archaeological site located beneath the northwest slope of the Acropolis. The word “agora” applies to an assembly of people and by extend marks the gathering place. In modern Greek the term means “marketplace”.”
The Ancient Agora of Athens is situated between Monastiraki and the Acropolis. The Agora is a captivating site that captures the essence of ancient Athens. As we strolled through the…

What if Socrates’ death sentence was justified? I’m sure you’re rolling your eyes. After all, he’s likely the greatest philosopher that ever lived and a method of teaching —named the Socratic Method out of reverence—bears his name.
Reverence is a good word to describe the current treatment for the man who possibly lived in 400 BC. Author Donald Robertson points out the presently popular Stoics used Socrates’ ideas as a building block. In fact, words written about him started Zeno of Citium down his path. Plus, Epictetus spoke admiringly about him as well.
The Oracle of Delphi even confirmed no one was wiser than Socrates. So, what could justify his punishment?
The philosopher’s curated story states he annoyed the Athenian establishment with his Socratic Method. In other words, he asked too many questions. Just think about your five-year-old nephew continuously asking “why” as you try to answer. Now, manifest that into a grown man’s frame.
Speaking of children, Socrates’ accusers also charged him with corrupting the youth of Athens. By “corrupting” most proclaim this means questioning their elders.

Many are troubled or have difficulty understanding the meanings of CLR James’s meditations on Classical Athens and his study of American civilization. Far more important than whether antiquity and modern societies consistently embody profound philosophical values is what are our own democratic aspirations. This is the riddle at the intersection of James Athenian meditation within his book American Civilization.
Can Classical Athens be a measure for appraising America? Can the world of Aristotle, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Cleon, and Pericles illuminate the ethnically and culturally plural United States? How does nuclear power compare with a few thousand Greeks battling in the Peloponnesian Wars, or at Marathon, Platea, and Salamis in the Greco-Persian Wars? As the 1950s began, C.L.R. James, a Caribbean radical scholar, thought this comparative thinking central for clarifying freedom and popular self-government. Perhaps sublimated within the American constitutional struggle for happiness was the class struggle.
Between the Struggle for Happiness and the Class Struggle
CLR James (1901-1989) wrote on diverse topics: Haiti, Russia, France, Ghana, and Hungary. He also purposefully considered Shakespeare, Herman Melville, the Hegelian dialectic, Caribbean women of the barrack yard, and the sport of cricket. Placing Classical Athens in conversation with mid-twentieth century America, this experimental meditation challenges us. Can we think beyond boundaries? This is what James’s book American Civilization (1950) poses to the reader.
James was detained as an undesirable immigrant and a political prisoner at Ellis Island in 1952. His defense strategy, though he never found a fit public platform for it like Paul Robeson, was to explain the dilemmas of American democracy and civilization to the public and overcome official authorities.
Why Compare Athens and America?
James compared tropes of ancient Athens and modern America. He discussed questions of popular self-emancipation that are subordinated by rigid historical materialist views. Whether poor, powerless, alienated, or aware of a conquering force, most observers have a false idea of toiling people's creative potential. This is a result that dialogues about culture, civilization, and democracy generally, assume commoners have no part. Perhaps, their lives are permitted as cultural decoration for society.
A Trinidadian activist and illegal immigrant to the U.S., James believed these ancient and modern societies were valuable comparative referents to unpack this dilemma of freedom. This was so, even though the classical Athenian city-state was probably no larger than the size of the population of 1950s Vermont, one of America's smallest states. And the ancients' economy was probably no bigger than one modern department store.
Who compares a continent-wide modern country to an archipelago of islands in antiquity? Of course, a Caribbean man who admires Ancient Greece. But he was not juxtaposing a small place with an imperial center. James was evaluating world civilizations and clarifying the search for popular struggles within them.
Every Cook Can Govern and the Meaning of American Civilization
We must remember that James’s Every Cook Can Govern (1956) argued that the classical Athenian city-state was a direct democracy. That this could inform rebellious modern politics against elite representative governments, whether maintained by capitalists, communists, or trade union hierarchy. However, in American Civilization, the Athenian meaning was more obscure.
A hint is James’s Greece tells us something about the relations between working people, intellectuals, and artists. Further, it placed the ancient theatrical dramas of Aeschylus and Aristophanes in conversation with the modern popular culture of American films, comic strips, sports, and television. More than what academic literary critics thought, James’s mind was on what the audience or spectators did in response to popular cultural productions in antiquity. Further, what could they accomplish in the present and future?
First, we must understand that at least since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. has been in a permanent culture war around social identities. The perennial dispute is Anglo-America, that some wish to “make great again,” versus ethnically plural multi-cultural America. American conservatives claim that Greco-Roman heritage is foundational to Western civilization. On this basis, some say America is a civilization. They wish to place the U.S., after World War II, as taking over leadership of the world from Europe. This cultural approach arguably last had free reign in the early 1950s as James was writing shortly before the emergence of the Third World national liberation epoch.
Cultural Wars Around Social Identities
Today the U.S. is seen by most progressive scholars of American Studies as not a civilization but as a harvest of empire. A plurality of many ethnicities and cultures have gathered; American Exceptionalism is not the best means to account for this. Though the idea that progressives are against the empire of capital is most often a cruel joke. This is not irrelevant to understanding James’s American Civilization. For he points out correctly that modern business management theorists during World War II understood, far better than the Moscow-oriented communists, that workers wished to directly govern their industrial workplaces. And the historical evidence of the practices of both, two different hostile visions to popular self-government, prove James’s view accurate. This explains much about contemporary not merely early 1950s America. Still, this issue is what the link to the Ancient Greeks is all about; discovering the sublimation of everyday people’s potential.
James’s Athenian thought experiments for America go beyond the culture wars which is really a misnomer. The question is how will humans live on this planet; this is what the low-intensity, sometimes open conflicts have been about. What values will humans live by? It does not require ancient Greece or modern America to historically maintain a consistent set of values for this meditation to be useful. In fact, creative conflicts in societies can reveal not just chaos through possessive individualism but common futures. Observation of Hegelian contradictions is not about permanent sins or hypocrisy. Rather, the nuclei of the new society and their struggle to be born.
Beyond Culture Wars: American Civilization and Ancient Greeks
James’s American Civilization (1950), posthumously published in 1993, embodied this transition between the old world of looking at things and the new. But not fully as we might expect a famous Pan-African anti-colonial and independent socialist to do so.
James carried on the tradition of the French intellectual Tocqueville, and many other European thinkers who visited the U.S. from abroad. He was perhaps among the last to do his own comparative reflection on how America sustained, or not, the older foundations of Europe, which many assumed were philosophically Greek.
Placing the Athenian Legacy in Support of Popular Struggles
Most Americans, even university professors, cannot process intellectual thought that doesn't adhere to the patterns of the two main American electoral parties that overlord society together. James, counter-intuitively for many, was placing the Athenian legacy on the side of the workers, women, and Black freedom movements. After all, he was writing about civilization.
American civilization needed a coherent political and cultural philosophy. He was aware classical Athens subordinated women, slaves, and immigrants. James was trying to improve on the direct democratic sensibility for modern politics.
Civilization and National Cultures?
Contrary to Andrew Ross’s view, James was not writing about civilization or the prospects of socialism in one country. Instead, he was asking what was behind the cultural front built around Franklin Roosevelt produced by state planners, progressive intellectuals, and trade union hierarchy.
James was writing about a perceived civilization or national culture and incorporating dynamic tensions. It doesn’t matter whether we or James see America as a unified national culture or not. American concerns with disunity reveal this is how the vast majority see things, even where they dispute the American character and purpose.
The struggles for an ambiguous workers' democracy, and Black and women's liberation, he reconciled with the ideals of Greek antiquity that normally was wielded by modern Western elites. James did not strongly emphasize, in this publication, America as foundationally an empire based on African slavery and conquering the Indigenous, and for good reason.
Discarding Historical Trauma for a Renewal of Political Philosophy
The reception of James’s American Civilization is fumbled where it does not center James as an aspiring cultivator of the popular will. Moreover, where it does not illustrate that he is trying to clarify the political philosophy of ordinary Americans.
James was writing for a popular audience, who in the aftermath of World War II, did not easily grasp anti-imperialism. We must remember in real life he agitated against World War II as a clash of racists, imperialists, and authoritarians on both sides. This was something the Moscow-oriented communists did not do. For, like Stalinist Russia, they became allies of Franklin Roosevelt.
Before the Montgomery Bus Boycott: Thinking Beyond Equal Opportunity
This manuscript was an exercise in creative self-expression and not merely disciplined to a radical political movement. More significantly, those who pursue the death of the American nation culturally and intellectually (but not really, it's just an academic trope) fail to posit what should be America's political philosophical basis.
While in the early 1950s, the modern civil rights movement as embodied by the Montgomery Bus Boycott had not yet begun, we must remember something crucial. Equal opportunity to enter the rules of hierarchy has no democratic basis (direct majority rule) and has only renewed the American empire. It can only have a democratic basis for those who wish to diversify the hierarchies of a republic, which by definition doesn’t believe everyday people can govern.
This perennial failure, but intentional act for those who sell past traumas for present decadent collaborations, was far from what James was pursuing. The colonized man from the British empire sojourning within the American empire was trying something different. American Civilization was trying to discover popular self-management beyond voters for electoral politics, aware the vote had not yet been guaranteed to all.
Gathering Fragments Like an Archaeologist
James’s American Civilization is like many ancient Greek texts. Their discovery and publication, as archaeologists and historians comprehend, is a retrieval project of incomplete fragments that only partially indicate the world of their authors. James’s final draft may have clarified and foreshadowed the nature of the American empire. Similar to his Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways (1952), he might have shown the solution was the motley crew, the global toilers of Herman Melville’s whaling vessel, cooperating and aspiring to save the social ecology under arduous circumstances. The preface to James’s Melville book reminded this was one part of a larger study of the U.S.
However, American Civilization articulates a scenario, seemingly outdated from the moment it was written. What if John L. Lewis, the famous trade union leader of the mineworkers, became the next president after Harry Truman? This was an irritating projection for those who knew James was an advocate of workers' self-management, and Lewis was part of repressing such social instincts during the Age of the CIO labor movement (1933-1955). Still, many miss the ancient Greek content of James’s thought experiment.
Learning from Aristophanes's Sausage-Seller
James argued that if American intellectuals in the early 1950s could understand artistic creation, like Aristophanes in his play The Knights, ordinary people could be encouraged to subvert populist authoritarian leaders, such as Cleon in the era of the Peloponnesian War. The ""sausage-seller"" appears to do this in The Knights; James’s American Civilization uncharacteristically refers not simply to workers, farmers, and cooks but to sausage-sellers, a plebian identity from ancient Greece. Though many Americans eat hot dogs and sausages, ordinary toilers have a difficult time revolting against bureaucracy within their own freedom movements.
James proposed, not an affirmation of the authoritarian trade union leader or progressive politician; rather, an impending confrontation with them by the ""sausage-sellers."" That Lewis was a Republican, who both sided and clashed with Franklin Roosevelt, and who was a major trade union leader, complicates things nicely. If James’s readers were actually going to think for themselves. Many formally educated have had difficulty since the book was published posthumously. Why write about Greek antiquity or workers at all?
James explained that observers of American civilization, unlike European history (ancient and modern), do not understand that behind great personalities above society (in politics, sports, and entertainment) are the aspirations, the repressed strivings of social classes and groups. While James believed every ordinary toiler could govern society, there was a counter-vailing idea. Those individual personalities who express heroism and creative genius do not mirror the abilities of commoners. But this is a result that society is not arranged properly for everyday people to arrive on their own authority. Many like to live vicariously through great personalities above society. James, the cultivator of the popular will, was trying to draw them out of their shell below society.
The Social Motion Below the Great Personalities Above Society
James felt the classical city-state was approximating or approaching this possibility in a more primitive way before the emergence of modern politics. We must remember the totality of ancient Greece is invented by archaeologists. Classical Athens functioned substantially toward a future without a past.
Behind the statesmen (Cleisthenes, Solon, Cleon, and Pericles) were the emerging “proletarians of Piraeus.” Observing and judging the artistic productions of Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, was an audience of rank-and-file citizens. Importantly, not professional experts.
James underscored it was the popular audiences of theatrical productions that thousands of years later were manufactured as “high culture” by American and Western elites that decided what plays were the greatest. And so, the ordinary people of Athens had the capacity for independent judgment. And given the content of the award-winning plays, they clearly had the ability to make political judgments. Therefore, James is saying to his American audience that popular culture is high culture. And the latter is a fabrication unless it centers the judgment and capacities of everyday people. Western and American elites would be surprised to hear this.
Aeschylus’s Oresteia, Dick Tracy, and the Mafia in 1950s America
In the early 1950s U.S., people delighted in Dick Tracy comic strips and films depicting the Mafia. For James, these had something in common. Ordinary Americans were not satisfied with hierarchical government; they wished to live outside the state and its law. Though, of course, these were impositions. Tracy, a private detective, surprisingly had something in common with gangsters. They had guns, took matters into their own hands, and were not police.
American toilers wanted to be their own law-givers. While Plato searched for personalities to discipline the grassroots of the city-state, he felt it was a must, where Athenian commoners, even slaves, walked the streets like they were audacious peers of elitist citizens. It is debatable whether this is structurally true of ancient Athens. Rather, this was James’s Plato observing and fearing, through the trope of Socrates, the popular self-emancipating potential. This is our audacious Caribbean radical scholar's concern.
Vendettas, Patriarchy and Popular Courts
James loved Aeschylus’s Oresteia Trilogy. The meaning of its series of vendettas is disputed. Does it justify patriarchy or suggest a rebellion against it? Does it point to popular courts as the meaning of justice or the state as an argument for containing the Furies? Nevertheless, the audience decided these plays were award-winning. More crucially, as citizens, the audience had to decide, after the play the meaning of popular justice and their role in carrying it out.
James explained you can only relate to this if you have the sensibility of the ancient Greeks. Ordinary people’s actual social status in ancient Athens, or in modern America, was not decisive. Paramount was, how in culture and politics, commoners found means to think beyond their leaders and act on their own authority. What was revealed in Greek culture, sublimated in plays by Aeschylus or Aristophanes and their audiences, could also be seen in American popular culture. This told James something about mass audiences. Despite their surface psychology, they possess explosive potential.
The Odes of Pindar, Bureaucratic Politicians, and Business
James points to the poetry of Pindar implying it tells us about the commoners of ancient Greece and the U.S. What could he mean? He means a society that celebrates sports and competition, whether in the Olympic games or in modern baseball and football stadiums, where writing odes to the winners, confesses the true character of their nations. This cannot be embodied by politicians and businessmen. The barefoot and poor, with state sponsorship, little league uniforms, or playing in the street, express creative capacities in games that society is not organized for them to do so in politics. This can suggest a decline and fall for America or an emerging new beginning.
The comparative conversation about Athens and America does not move in straight and predictable patterns, especially for those who think like a voter for elite representative government. But even if the reader is starting to enjoy this meditation, how do we account for James’s celebration of Phidias and Praxiteles? What do ancient sculptors and architects say about the American proletariat? Further, James often did not make clear what the Peloponnesian War and Greco-Persian wars said about the potential of commoners in Greece and America.
What Can Be Accomplished in a Time of War?
Many scholars recognize that the Peloponnesian War (the battle between Athens and Sparta, which Sparta won) revealed an imperial tendency in Athens just as much as it embodies the search for federation. It is debatable what the meaning of the earlier Greco-Persian wars should mean for America. However, America, following World War II, was coming out of the experience of both foreign wars, and race, gender, and class struggles within.  James is saying great art and great heroism cannot fulfill themselves during war; society can only support them when it has put war behind them. Still, ordinary people’s instincts toward popular democracy, initially suppressed, can emerge in times of war as well. Even, if the rulers above society don’t wish this to happen. For James, the Athenian direct democracy presided over by Pericles between these ancient wars, was a new beginning where all citizens took part in popular councils and assemblies. There were no specialists and experts that dominated James’s Athens. Contrarily, this had been the vision of Franklin Roosevelt's planners and cultural apparatus.   The average Athenian citizen made decisions on economic planning, judicial affairs, and foreign relations, all matters the community faced. The Athenians knew everything was political, and art, science, and philosophy were integrated with politics and government, not in a dogmatic ideological way. But in the sense that, Greek citizens made the decisions directly that governed their lives. James was searching for a future America with these ideals and principles; certainly, the American conservative only pretended to do this for white men alone.
James did not believe Aristotle's politics should guide 1950s America. Though one should read him to understand politics and philosophy. Aristotle's Poetics interested James where the latter clarified what Athenian drama had been about when society was not menaced by war. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes were about purging their audiences of pity and terror. Where the masses had pity for heroes, and felt society was stalked by doom, they might emerge to take matters into their own hands after witnessing such theatre.  However, to relate to this proposition, we must reject tragedy as fate or some catastrophe beyond our control. When an actual play comes to an end, what is at issue for James’s Aristotle, is what will the audience do afterward. James’s American Civilization felt progressive cultural critics in the U.S. instead attached themselves to hierarchical regimes instead of the unfolding impulses to popular self-management.
American Labor: Wartime Strikes, Wildcat Strikes
We must remember that during World War II, most trade union leaders signed contracts with the bosses for a no-strike pledge for patriotic sustaining of war production. As Martin Glaberman has documented, then the rank-and-file, through their wildcat strikes, took greater initiatives than they had, even during the early CIO labor movement. We must remember that the first March on Washington Movement that strived to forge African American civil rights, despite its zig-zags, was a wartime strike.
Ordinary Americans’ apparent consciousness and psychology yesterday were no indication of their independent insurgent action tomorrow. James made clear in American Civilization that if workers followed John L. Lewis or Walter Reuther, the auto workers’ leader today, this was not an indication of what may happen tomorrow. Where leaders follow the instincts of everyday people below society (or not), it does not mean commoners cannot rupture with them.
What Do America’s Wartime Strikes Have to Do With Ancient Greece?
What do American wartime strikes have to do with Ancient Greece? The Greeks who took part in the Peloponnesian War and the Persian Wars had their own racial, imperial, and patriarchal impulses. They lived through times of crisis where they did not know exactly what they wanted. It is these same people, who forged the first aspiring direct democracy. Separate from ideals associated with ancient Athens is a reality: imperfect people with blind spots were the foundation of an impressive civilization. This is so cross-culturally, when considering any world civilization, the search for profound autonomy must be drawn out of barbaric circumstances.  James’s American Civilization aspired to show that the purported genius of American organization was not a penchant for national production or industriousness. Rather, the main currents of American character are the capacities for popular self-government among ordinary people. Intellectuals who cannot see this, James says, commit treason. Our capacity to grasp this has something to do with how we understand Classical Athens.
Re-Reading Classical Athens Beyond the Affirmative Action Empire
A proper understanding of James’s Greek antiquity studies is still emerging. And aspects of how he grasped the United States are still obscure. Can ancient Athens, or its spirit and ideals, be a model for America as a civilization, or a comparative reference for our understanding of American freedom and popular self-government? Do we inherently clash with contemporary dispositions in such pursuit? Where it forces us to move beyond making America “great again,” but also the affirmative action empire and the ethnically plural police state, James’s legacies deserve reconsideration.

The history of Athens is closely tied to the history of Greek democracy. It was in Athens that this form of political regime, which contributed to the city’s greatness and spread throughout the Greek world, developed. However, the early history of Athens remains obscure. It is known that there was a palace at the future city’s location during the Mycenaean period, surviving the destruction at the end of the second millennium. This allowed Athens to be a refuge for Greeks who settled in Ionia in the early 11th century. Little is known about the city’s history before the late 7th century. Aristotle, in the first part of the Constitution of Athens, reports that the original royal power was divided among three archons, later joined by six thesmothetes. Initially appointed for life, then elected for ten years, and finally annually, these archons governed with the assistance of a council of elders on the hill of Ares, known as the Areopagus. Two events marked the late 7th century: Cylon’s attempt to establish tyranny, thwarted by archon Megacles of the Alcmaeonid family, and Draco’s creation of a legal code regulating punishment for crimes of bloodshed. Aristotle also attributes a constitution to Draco, which modern critics consider a forgery from the late 5th century by those opposed to democracy.
With the beginning of the 6th century, and despite the numerous obscurities that remain, the…

I just arrived in Athens. My cab driver’s name was Christos.
His father was from Greek Macedonia, his mother from Crete. Men in Crete wear all black as a symbol of respect, he told me, “for the men who fought and lost their lives in the many wars, ‘fighting for our freedoms.’”
“Greece has so much history for such a little country.” “Look at you, you have such a big country and so little history.” (Ahem… I had been reading Thomas Jefferson’s biography on the plane.)
Christos had a construction company with over 25 employees before the Economic Crisis. As work started to dry up, he continued to pay his workers and had to lay them off gradually as the money ran out. He still has a company “on paper” but there has been no work for years. The company was started by his father who, he said, cries because he thought he had given his son a livelihood and now there is nothing.
I asked if he was against Greece being in the European Union. “No, I am not against Europe, I just want Europe to care about Greeks. Not Greece. Greeks.”
Cristos has three children so, he said, what was he to do? He spent money buying a taxi license. Two years ago, it cost him 100,000 euros (from 250,000 before the crisis.) Now the price has dropped again to 50,000 but Christos can’t recover the money he has already paid. He says that there is no work and even if there were, no one would hire him because he has several diplomas — he is too qualified.
He was rushing to finish up and get home before tonight’s World Cup soccer match started. Brazil-Colombia. I asked who he was for. “Brazil, of course.”
“You know they have the most expensive player in the world: Neymar?” (I did know.) “One hundred million euros. That is what they paid for a futbol player,” Christos said. “We — this humanity — we have to change. We have to change because we have children.”
As he pulled into the hotel, he apologized, “So much history. Such a much bigger conversation.”
But, sometimes the only way to start big conversations is with small ones — like a short chat with a stranger.

“The Parthenon Marbles are part of the Parthenon Temple, the most important work of ancient Greek architecture, considered the highest sculpture and artwork of its time. Of course, its importance doesn’t end there; what happened afterwards contributes to its story” said Zeynep Boz from the eastern side, bringing joy to the western coast of the Aegean.
Boz, a prehistoric archaeology graduate with art, law, and ethics degrees, represents Turkey as the Head of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. She previously served as a contact person for UNESCO with the UN Security Council. When she declared that there was no evidence supporting the claim that the Parthenon Marbles were taken to England legitimately during the Ottoman Empire, she became the person of the week in Greece, making Athens happy. But what is the story of the Parthenon Sculptures, which pit Greece against England? What does Turkey’s cultural support for Athens mean?
The bust of Nefertiti, extracted by German archaeologists from Egypt and brought to the Neues Museum in Berlin; the Rosetta Stone, discovered by a French soldier during a fortification excavation in Egypt and sent to the British Museum; the statue of Emperor Lucius Verus, returned to Turkey after being smuggled abroad in 1972… History, discovery, and plunder… All have been intertwined for centuries. The fate of the marble sculptures friezes, and architectural pieces taken from the Parthenon Temple in the Athenian Acropolis was no different.
Dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, these sculptures went from Athens, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to England in the early 19th century. It was claimed that the artefacts were taken with permission, thanks to a decree obtained by British diplomat Lord Elgin from the Ottomans. Support for returning this significant historical treasure, which has often caused diplomatic tension between Athens and London, came from Turkey on the other side of the Aegean. Zeynep Boz, the Turk who made Athens happy, answered questions.
Your speech about the Parthenon Sculptures at last month’s UNESCO meeting attracted attention. Is Turkey’s support for Greece’s efforts to retrieve the Parthenon Sculptures from England unexpected?
Frankly, Turkey’s support is not unexpected. The Parthenon Marbles is already a matter on which Greece is never alone. Turkey’s support is both sincere and deep-rooted and not new. It has continued uninterruptedly with a non-political approach. Likewise, Greece’s support for Turkey in combating cultural heritage smuggling is equally vital.
I think the reason behind making Athens so happy is your statement about a controversial document. For years, the United Kingdom has claimed an Ottoman decree granted permission for the artefacts to be taken to England.
Absolutely. The difference in this year’s session was Turkey coming forward and saying, “There is no such document.” England claimed that these artefacts were purchased legally from the Ottomans, according to Ottoman laws. As in Turkey, we had to respond. I needed to correct this. Otherwise, as a member of a country holding the Ottoman State archives, I would have accepted this claim.
We need a document showing that the Parthenon was legally acquired during the Ottoman period. There is only one translation mentioned in England. I need to see the original alongside it to call something a translation. So that there is a reference point. There is only something written in Italian on paper… No Ottoman seal, no sultan’s monogram…
So, it’s like a piece of note?
I wouldn’t want to say it like that, but in a way, yes. At least I can tell, “It has no official status.” I know Turkey’s stance had a significant impact.
It is perceived as if it changed something. However, over the years, I have seen the great sacrifices and efforts the Greek delegation has made.
What if England says, “Then let’s look at your archives”?
Many British researchers have already come to Turkey. Not just at the government level. Many academics have come to Turkey and conducted research in the state archives. The Ottoman State Archives are already open to the public. This is not something we are hiding. So, I say to England in response to this claim, “If we don’t have documentation, wouldn’t it be better not to make such a claim?”
You represent Turkey at the ministerial level. However, you are primarily a cultural person. You say, “You don’t discriminate based on religion, language, or race; we unite in the effort to reclaim our cultural heritage; friendship transcends borders.” Are the recent developments a concrete result of the détente policy in Turkey-Greece relations that began towards the end of last year? Or is it an ongoing cultural collaboration that is independent of this?
I support the second option. The first option also influenced the growth of the second. When relations between the two countries are better, when the winds of friendship blow, the manoeuvring areas of every nation naturally expand; this is a fact. But believe me, it would have been said earlier if this had happened. It was a very natural comment made by Turkey. It was related to the moment; it was not planned. As you know, Turkey’s Minister of Culture Mehmet Nuri Ersoy recently visited Greece and met with his counterpart there. Following these meetings, his Greek counterpart briefed him on the matter.
When the Minister returned to Turkey, he requested information from us. He said, “Let’s always continue this support; I want to be informed of all developments. This is a global issue where Turkey needs to show its stance.” These are not insignificant developments. However, on an expert level, Turkey and Greece have always supported each other in a non-political, technical manner.
Is the British Museum now obliged to return the Parthenon Sculptures?
We know how much the habits of collecting and collection practices have harmed cultural assets and how much they have fragmented and destroyed them. I wish the British Museum would return them… We are used to seeing moves related to England that will be turning points in human rights and many other areas, milestones in world history.
Of course, we would like to see one of these regarding the Parthenon. We would also like to see this with artefacts belonging to Turkey. So, is the British Museum obliged to return them? The obligation can be debated. But at least in an era where apologies are being made, I would very much like to see the British Museum return these artefacts to Greece.

Ancient Athenian Ostracism,https://medium.com/@theartfulhistorian/ever-wished-you-could-banish-someone-from-your-city-in-ancient-athens-you-could-8cb221002aa6,"Sign up

Thousands of pieces of ostracon have been uncovered in Athens.
These ostraka are pieces of pottery that acted as voting tokens during an ostracism. In an ostracism vote, people (free men) would scratch the name of someone who they believed threatened democracy onto ostraka and if 6000 or more votes were cast, the person with the most votes was banished from Athens for a period of 10 years.
The men who voted in this decision were part of the Athenian Assembly (Ekklesia), which was made up of adult citizen men. These men made up a fairly small percentage of the 30,000–60,000 large population which was also made up of women, enslaved people and foreign-born residents.
Ostracism did not happen automatically, the assembly had to vote each year in favour of holding one and often they were not called. In the 71-year period that ostracisms took place (487 BCE — 416 BCE), only 13 individuals were ostracised.
If the vote was to be held, the actual ostracism poll would happen two months later. The voting process was called the ostracophoria, meaning ‘election to ostracise’.
The unlucky individual who ‘won’ the vote had 10 days to put their affairs in order before they had to leave with no* possibility of return before a decade was up. If one did try to reenter Athens during this time, they faced the possibility of the death penalty.
Despite these harsh terms, an ostracised individual was still allowed to keep any property they owned and could still be considered a citizen of Athens, which, as stated earlier, was a privilege which was not extended to everyone. Further, on return to Athens, it seemed that little changed for the outcast and they could return to politics with significant social status.
No politician was safe from ostracism and it was extremely common for a senior member of the state to have to take a 10-year ‘break’ from Athens due to the vote. One such example was Themistocles, a non-aristocratic politician and general of the 5th-6th centuries BCE who had succeeded in leading Greece to triumph over their enemy, Persia. At one point, Themistocles was one of the most famous and important politicians in Athens, meaning that he was a threat to democracy.
The pieces of ostracon above hold the names, top to bottom, of Pericles (politician and general), Cimon (politician and general), and Aristides (politician). Pericles is the man who put into motion the building program that created the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis. Aristides is one of the lucky banished men who actually got to return to Athens before his ten years were up. Aristides was ostracised in 482 BCE but was recalled to the city-state in 479 BCE to help Athens get ready for the upcoming war against Persia.
Although the purpose of the ostracism was to vote out somebody who became too powerful, it’s likely many people just voted for the person they liked the least. Some of the votes found in ancient rubbish dumps seem to have had a message of personal grievance. Some names had the added epithets of “traitor”, “slanderer” or “adulterer”. The politician Cimon, whose name can be seen on a piece of ostracon in the above picture, had his personal scandal alluded to by at least one angry voter. Smithsonian Magazine writes that one ostracon had the words “Kimon Miltiadou, take Elpinike and go!” etched onto it, Elpinike being the half-sister he was rumoured to have had an affair with.
For better or for worse, the last ostracism took place in Athens in 416 BCE.
Should we bring ostracism back? It seems like a much faster and more efficient way of non-violently removing people from authority, than the bureaucracy that keeps politicians in check today. I, for one, am a fan.

Imagine walking in the footsteps of the greatest thinkers of all time, witnessing their lively debates, learning from their wisdom, and participating in their democracy. This is what it was like to visit the Agora of Athens, the heart and soul of ancient Greece.
The Agora was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
In this article, we will take you on a virtual tour of the Agora of Athens, and show you how you can think like a Greek. We will explore the fascinating world of the philosophers, who challenged the status quo, questioned everything, and sought the truth. We will also discover the secrets of the citizens, who practiced direct democracy, exercised their rights and duties, and defended their freedom. And we will admire the beauty of the gods, who inspired awe, devotion, and art.
Are you ready to embark on this journey? Then let’s go to the Agora of Athens, and learn how to think like a Greek.
The Agora was the birthplace of Western philosophy, where Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle taught and debated. These three philosophers are known as the founders of the classical tradition of philosophy, and their ideas have influenced countless thinkers and fields of study throughout history. But who were they, and what did they teach?
Socrates was the oldest and most controversial of the three philosophers. He was born around 470 BC, and he spent most of his life in the Agora, engaging in conversations with anyone who would listen. He did not write anything himself, but his words and deeds were recorded by his followers, especially Plato.
Socrates was famous for his method of questioning everything and everyone, often annoying the authorities and the public. He believed that the only way to find the truth was to examine one’s own beliefs and assumptions, and to expose the contradictions and ignorance that lay beneath them. He once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
Socrates was interested in ethical and political questions, such as what is justice, what is virtue, and how should one live. He claimed that he did not know the answers, but that he was seeking them with the help of his interlocutors. He also claimed that he was guided by a divine voice, or a daimon, that warned him of what not to do.
Socrates’ relentless questioning and criticism of the established norms and values of his society earned him many enemies, especially among the powerful and the wealthy. He was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety, and he was brought to trial in 399 BC. He defended himself with eloquence and wit, but he refused to compromise his principles or to escape from prison. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
Socrates’ death was a tragic and heroic event that marked the end of an era, but also the beginning of a legacy. His followers, especially Plato, continued his mission of seeking the truth and questioning the conventional wisdom. Socrates became a symbol of courage, wisdom, and integrity, and his example inspired generations of philosophers and thinkers.
Plato was the most devoted and influential student of Socrates. He was born around 428 BC, and he came from a wealthy and noble family. He was interested in poetry and politics, but he abandoned these pursuits after meeting Socrates and becoming his disciple. He followed Socrates everywhere, and he recorded his dialogues and teachings in his writings.
Plato was the founder of the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He established the Academy in 387 BC, near the sacred grove of Academus, outside the walls of Athens. The Academy was a place where students and scholars could study and discuss various subjects, such as mathematics, astronomy, music, and philosophy. The Academy attracted many brilliant minds, such as Aristotle, Euclid, and Archimedes.
Plato was the author of many dialogues, which are considered the most important and influential works of philosophy. In his dialogues, he used the form of a conversation between Socrates and other characters, such as his friends, enemies, or famous figures. He used this form to explore various topics, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, morality, beauty, and justice. He also used this form to present his own views and arguments, often through the mouth of Socrates.
Plato was an idealist, who believed that there was a higher and perfect realm of ideas, or forms, that existed beyond the physical and changing world. He believed that the forms were the true essence and models of everything that exists, and that they could only be known by reason and intuition. He also believed that the forms were the source of goodness, beauty, and justice, and that the goal of human life was to achieve harmony and alignment with them. He once said, “Philosophy begins in wonder.”
Plato was also a visionary, who imagined the ideal state and the ideal ruler in his most famous dialogue, the Republic. In the Republic, he argued that the state should be governed by the philosopher-king, who had the knowledge and the virtue to rule wisely and justly. He also argued that the state should be divided into three classes, according to their natural abilities and roles: the guardians, who were the rulers and protectors; the auxiliaries, who were the soldiers and helpers; and the producers, who were the farmers and craftsmen. He also argued that the state should provide education, censorship, and eugenics, to ensure the harmony and stability of the society.
Plato’s ideas and writings have had a profound and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most original thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
Aristotle was the most brilliant and prolific student of Plato. He was born in 384 BC, in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He was the son of a physician, and he had a natural curiosity and interest in the natural world. He joined the Academy when he was 17 years old, and he stayed there for 20 years, until the death of Plato. He then left Athens and traveled to various places, such as Asia Minor, Lesbos, and Macedonia. He became the tutor of Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, who conquered most of the known world. He returned to Athens in 335 BC, and he founded his own school, the Lyceum, where he taught and wrote until his death in 322 BC.
Aristotle was the author of many works, which cover almost every field of knowledge, such as logic, ethics, politics, biology, physics, and metaphysics. He wrote in a systematic and analytical style, using observation, classification, and deduction. He was the first to develop a comprehensive and coherent system of philosophy, which aimed to explain the nature and causes of everything that exists.
Aristotle was an empiricist, who believed that knowledge was derived from experience and observation of the physical world. He rejected Plato’s theory of forms, and he argued that the essence and form of a thing were inseparable from its matter and substance. He also argued that the world was composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire, and that each element had a natural place and motion. He also argued that the world was governed by four causes: the material cause, which was the matter of a thing; the formal cause, which was the shape and structure of a thing; the efficient cause, which was the agent or force that produced a thing; and the final cause, which was the purpose or goal of a thing. He once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
Aristotle was also a practical and ethical thinker, who was interested in the best way of living and the best form of government. He wrote the Nicomachean Ethics, which is considered one of the most influential works of moral philosophy. In the Nicomachean Ethics, he argued that the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life was happiness, which he defined as the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. He also argued that there were two types of virtue: intellectual virtue, which was acquired by learning and reasoning; and moral virtue, which was acquired by habit and practice. He also argued that virtue was a mean between two extremes, or vices, and that it required practical wisdom and moral judgment.
Aristotle also wrote the Politics, which is considered one of the most influential works of political philosophy. In the Politics, he argued that the state was a natural and necessary institution, which arose from the human need for social and political association. He also argued that there were different types of states, according to their constitution and their aim. He classified the states into six categories, based on the number and the quality of the rulers: monarchy, aristocracy, and polity, which were the good forms; and tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy, which were the bad forms. He also argued that the best form of state was the polity, which was a mixed and balanced constitution, where the middle class had the power and the common good was the aim.
Aristotle’s ideas and writings have had a tremendous and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
The Agora was also the center of Athenian democracy, where citizens voted and served as jurors. Athens was the first city-state to adopt a system of direct democracy, where every male citizen had the right and the duty to participate in the government. The Agora was where they gathered to elect magistrates, pass laws, and decide on war and peace. The Agora was also where they held trials, where citizens acted as both judges and jurors. One of the most famous trials was that of Socrates, who was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
But what exactly was democracy? And how did it work in Athens?
The word democracy means “rule by the people” in ancient Greek. It was a radical and revolutionary idea, that challenged the traditional forms of government, such as monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. It was based on the principle of equality, that all citizens had the same rights and responsibilities, regardless of their wealth, status, or birth. It was also based on the principle of freedom, that all citizens had the liberty to express their opinions, to choose their leaders, and to hold them accountable.
Democracy in Athens was not the same as democracy today. It was a direct and participatory democracy, where citizens made decisions by themselves, without representatives or intermediaries. It was also an exclusive and limited democracy, where only adult male citizens had the right to vote, while women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. It was also a fragile and unstable democracy, where factions, conflicts, and coups threatened its survival.
Democracy in Athens was practiced mainly in two institutions: the Assembly and the Courts. The Assembly was the main legislative and executive body, where citizens met at least once a month, and sometimes more often, to discuss and vote on various issues, such as laws, decrees, taxes, treaties, and wars. The Assembly was open to all citizens, who could attend, speak, and vote. The Assembly was also the supreme authority, that could elect, appoint, or dismiss magistrates, such as generals, treasurers, or archons. The Assembly was also the sovereign body, that could revise, amend, or abolish the constitution, or the fundamental laws of the state.
The Courts were the main judicial body, where citizens served as judges and jurors. The Courts were divided into several types, according to the nature and the amount of the cases, such as civil, criminal, public, or private. The Courts were composed of a large number of citizens, who were selected by lot, or randomly, from a pool of volunteers. The Courts were independent and autonomous, that could not be influenced or controlled by the Assembly or the magistrates. The Courts were also powerful and decisive, that could impose penalties, such as fines, exile, or death.
Democracy in Athens was a remarkable and unprecedented experiment, that inspired and influenced many other states and civilizations. It was also a challenging and demanding system, that required the active and informed participation of the citizens. It was also a noble and admirable ideal, that sought to achieve the common good and the public interest.
The Agora was also the place where temples and altars were dedicated to various gods and goddesses. The ancient Greeks were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods, each with their own personality and domain. The Agora had shrines for Zeus, the king of the gods; Athena, the patron goddess of Athens; Apollo, the god of the sun and music; Ares, the god of war; and many others. The Agora was also where religious festivals and ceremonies were held, such as the Panathenaia, the most important festival in honor of Athena. The festival included athletic contests, musical competitions, sacrifices, and a procession that carried a new robe for the statue of Athena.
But who were these gods and goddesses? And how did they influence the life and culture of the ancient Greeks?
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the personifications of the natural forces and phenomena, such as the sky, the sea, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the fire, the thunder, the rain, and the seasons. They were also the patrons and protectors of various aspects of human life, such as love, war, wisdom, justice, beauty, agriculture, commerce, and art. They were also the ancestors and relatives of the heroes and the legends, such as Hercules, Perseus, and Jason.
The ancient Greeks had a complex and rich mythology, that explained the origin and the history of the world, the gods, and the humans. They believed that the world was created by Chaos, the primordial void, from which emerged the first gods, such as Gaia, the earth; Uranus, the sky; and Tartarus, the underworld. They also believed that the gods were involved in a series of conflicts and wars, such as the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians; and the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the Olympians. They also believed that the gods interacted and intervened in the affairs of the humans, sometimes helping, sometimes harming, and sometimes falling in love with them.
The ancient Greeks worshipped and honored the gods in various ways, such as building temples and altars, making sacrifices and offerings, performing rituals and ceremonies, and holding festivals and games. They also sought the favor and the guidance of the gods, by consulting oracles and diviners, by making vows and prayers, and by following omens and signs. They also feared and respected the gods, by obeying their laws and commands, by avoiding their wrath and punishment, and by accepting their fate and will.
The ancient Greeks also expressed their admiration and devotion to the gods through art and literature, such as sculpture, painting, pottery, poetry, and drama. They created magnificent and realistic statues of the gods, such as the statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They also depicted the gods and their stories on various objects, such as vases, coins, and jewelry. They also composed epic and lyrical poems about the gods and their deeds, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer, and the Theogony and the Works and Days by Hesiod. They also wrote and performed tragic and comic plays about the gods and their relations with the humans, such as the Oresteia by Aeschylus, the Oedipus Rex by Sophocles, and the Bacchae by Euripides.
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the sources of awe and art, that inspired and influenced the life and culture of the ancient Greeks. They were also the symbols and the expressions of the values and the ideals of the ancient Greeks, such as courage, wisdom, beauty, and justice. They were also the reflections and the projections of the hopes and the fears of the ancient Greeks, such as love, war, fate, and death.
The Agora of Athens was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens witnessed the rise and fall of the Athenian democracy, the glory and tragedy of the Greek civilization, and the birth and development of the Western thought. It was the place where Socrates questioned and challenged, where Plato dreamed and idealized, where Aristotle observed and analyzed, where citizens voted and debated, where gods were worshipped and honored, and where art and literature were created and celebrated.
The Agora of Athens is a place that still inspires us today, and that we can learn from and admire. It is a place that reminds us of the achievements and the challenges of the human spirit, of the values and the ideals of the human society, and of the hopes and the fears of the human condition.
If you ever have the chance to visit Athens, don’t miss the opportunity to see the Agora for yourself. You will feel like you are traveling back in time, and you will discover the roots of Western civilization. You will also feel like you are connecting with the ancient Greeks, and you will understand their worldview and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens is not just a historical site. It is a living and breathing museum, where you can see, touch, and feel the history, the culture, and the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. It is also a vibrant and lively square, where you can meet, talk, and interact with the modern Greeks, who are the descendants and the inheritors of the ancient Greeks.
The Agora of Athens is a place where you can think like a Greek, act like a Greek, and be like a Greek. It is a place where you can experience the past, the present, and the future of the Greek civilization. It is a place where you can find yourself, lose yourself, and rediscover yourself.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you will never forget, and that you will always remember. It is a place that will change you, and that you will change. It is a place that will challenge you, and that you will challenge. It is a place that will inspire you, and that you will inspire.
The Agora of Athens is a place that awaits you, and that you await. It is a place that welcomes you, and that you welcome. It is a place that invites you, and that you invite.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should visit, and that you will visit. It is a place that you should see, and that you will see. It is a place that you should know, and that you will know.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should love, and that you will love.

This artwork contains the presence of humans. There are many people gathering up against each other while doing what seems to be studying. Proven by the books they carried and read, these figures represent all of the greatest mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists that lived in that specific decade. Dozens of these geniuses all gathered around to discuss, sharing their ideas, expressing their opinions, and learning from each other. The architectural yet enormous building is mostly painted white. Some figures lay on the ground, reading and conversing. Some are upstairs gathering together, making a little crowd. The color palette was mostly vibrant, but washed out. Yet you can still see the soft contrast between the people’s clothes and backgrounds.
The artist used shapes such as cubes, rounded, and curved to create perspectives on the architectural building. At the front, we can see the building’s perspective from the curved line on the roof. But the overall structure of the building was probably cubed or a block. These different and neatly spread types of shapes made the artwork look more composed. The whole composition looked like it was moving. Because the artist made designs of people interacting with one another, they also made the color palette soft, so it radiates peacefulness. The central interest of this artwork is the two main characters that were painted in the middle of the commotion. It was obvious to spot them since the other individuals were all gathering around them. The artist succeeded in gaining my attention to the two by highlighting the middle of the painting. As you can see, the area where they stand is a bit lighter than the rest. Such little details make the biggest difference when it comes to painting.
The painting took place during the historical era of Plato. Let’s analyze the most distinctive element, which is the two people that were standing in the middle. Research claims that the two characters happen to be Plato and Aristotle. Plato was wearing red and purple. This color symbolizes the color of spirituality. A color that inspires reflection and self-awareness. While Aristotle was wearing blue with brown, which symbolizes the sky, sea, and earth, it also represents reliability and wisdom. These are the two main elements that the artist wanted to show through the main characters. The overall mood of the painting has a sign of coolness and warmth at the same time. The cool color tones that were used actually made the mood warm because the amount of commotion made the painting somewhat peaceful and relaxing to see. The landscape came off as natural, as the painting used a little bit of green for the building, so the piece itself was naturalistic. The object of the monument was already perfect because it holds and completes the inside of the painting, which is the people.
Paragraph one explains what is happening in the painting. We already knew they were discussing and trying to express their thoughts. This represents all of the different opinions and answers between people. The painting shows us geniuses. Mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. Yet they are gathering together, trying to find and gain answers. This shows that everyone can disagree with one another. They can have different thoughts and philosophies about one case. The artist is trying to say that even if we are concerned and confused about a single matter, humans will try to find a way to solve it. The main theme behind this piece is the high Renaissance. If I were inside The School of Athens, I would probably try to catch up on the topic that was being discussed, so I wouldn’t feel left out. The story behind this art is that it’s positioned facing Disputa and symbolizes philosophy, setting up a contrast between religious and lay beliefs. The painting is abstract because it looks at other non-objective artistic elements of shape, form, and color. The artist explored his ideas beyond the canvas and physical reality. I would explain this artwork as a painting where people gathered up all their ideas. As proven by the painting itself and the dozen people there.
Raphael had created a masterpiece and expressive drawing. The soft and cool tones he used added to the overall feeling of composure, calm, and relaxation. The unseen movement between the people makes me feel at ease just by looking at it. The faint green tones developed a sign of liveliness and nature. For me personally, this artwork does not need any improvements, as it is already perfect and has met the criteria for being the aesthetic theory of Renaissance art.

Initially, I was skeptical. In the age of Covid, do people even attend conferences anymore? With free educational content on YouTube and virtual conferences on Zoom, what’s the point? Despite my doubts, I found myself driving to Athens to participate in Devoxx 2023. Devoxx Greece is a three-day event where developer communities gather to discover the latest technological advancements, presented by some of the most inspiring speakers in the industry. The Devoxx family, which includes Belgium, France, UK, Poland, Marocco, and Ukraine, welcomes over 15,000 Devoxxians annually!
To my surprise, the conference was exceptionally well-organized, and the turnout was impressive. Four large rooms were filled with enthusiastic attendees, eager to absorb the knowledge shared in each session. The talks were organized into the following tracks: Architecture, Containers & Infrastructure, Data & AI, Development Practices, Java, UI & UX, Programming Languages, and Security. In this post, I will share my impressions and key takeaways from the talks I attended.
But first some pictures from the venue and the event.
Let’s see some of the main points for the talks that I had attended and enjoyed :-)
Ted aimed to bridge the gap between developers and managers in his well-prepared talk, which was filled with numerous real-life examples from his own experiences. The presentation focused on the key responsibilities of managers, such as assembling strong teams rather than just hiring star programmers, fostering an environment that helps developers achieve a state of flow, minimizing disruptions by reducing unnecessary meetings, and even making tough decisions like relocating or dismissing individuals who negatively impact team dynamics.
Natalie, a Community Ambassador for OpenAI, showcased the latest advancements in AI, specifically focusing on transformers. One notable takeaway from her presentation was the introduction of Phind, an impressive AI-powered search engine designed for developers. This innovative tool not only cites sources but also automatically generates follow-up questions, among other features.
Apache Kafka has become the go-to standard for high-performance data streaming applications. Such applications are rarely focused solely on message processing; they often need to integrate Kafka messages with remote endpoints, store messages in a datastore, or relay them to third-party services.
Ozan from Red Hat showcased how Quarkus, combined with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, can be used to build Kafka-based event-driven architectures. Quarkus is a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework designed for creating Java applications. Using a sample application, Ozan demonstrated the key concepts and common patterns, illustrating how Quarkus simplifies the development of event-driven microservices and integrates seamlessly with Quarkus’ reactive core.
What an incredible talk! Dan delved into a fascinating concept: leveraging the untapped potential of a company’s computers by running tasks in Chrome tabs. Each tab functions as an isolated environment and boasts a robust API. So, why not utilize the browsers within an organization to act as containers for running workloads, ultimately saving money on servers? I’m eager to get my hands on the source code he demonstrated!
Eliza from Amity showed how she can effectively create with the help of Generative models technical (code) and nontechnical presentations with a clear structure, slides with bullet points, images, and or even videos.
Jane introduced us to Qwik, a novel JavaScript framework that employs a unique rendering paradigm called “resumability.” This approach allows a JavaScript app to be serialized into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique commonly used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. Qwik enables the creation of “resumable apps” that require minimal JavaScript for interactivity and employ fine-grained lazy loading to load only the necessary components. Jane’s talk provided guidance on getting started with Qwik.
The key points covered in her presentation included: understanding the Qwik framework, comparing Qwik to React and Angular, strategies for reducing the size of JS bundles, and a tutorial on building with Qwik. The presentation piqued my interest, and I’m eager to give Qwik a try.
Dionysis, the Director of DevOps at GWI, showed us OPA: Open Policy Agent, which makes it possible to write policies that test the changes Terraform is about to make before it makes them. Also, he combined OPA with another open-source tool called infracost that calculates the cost of a terraform plan. This way he can also test and limit the cost of a terraform plan before actually applying it. Nice ideas for our DevOps!
Frank, a principal at Databricks, delivered a lively and engaging presentation on Data Lakehouse, a new platform from Databricks that blends the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. This innovative approach provides the reliability, robust governance, and performance associated with data warehouses, while also offering the openness, flexibility, and machine learning support characteristic of data lakes. Essentially, data is stored at the S3 level, but ACID transactions can be performed on top of it. An important takeaway from the presentation was that the term “real-time pipelines” may be somewhat misleading, as there is always a slight latency. Additionally, Frank introduced the appealing concept of continuously ingesting all data and replacing traditional ELT pipelines with streaming pipelines — truly cutting-edge ideas!
Emilia, a software engineer specializing in mobile gaming technologies, shared insights from psychology and cognitive sciences to illustrate how their application can lead to more effective user experiences, both positively and negatively.
Key topics covered in her presentation included dual process theory, heuristics, the illusory truth effect, the paradox of choice, priming, and inadvertent priming, among others.
(Note to myself from the talk: The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over other from William James)
In his presentation, Mohammed, an avid Formula 1 enthusiast, explored how we can make our code deployments as secure as Formula 1 races. Drawing from various principles employed in F1, he demonstrated how we can learn from and adopt these concepts in the way we design, structure, deliver, and safeguard our systems.
The talk covered:
+ Importance of having a trusted and adversarial CI/CD pipeline
+ Security patterns: Least privileged principal, defence in depth, Zero trust
+ Resiliency patterns: Micro-segmentation, Anti-overload patterns
+ Monitoring and alerting
In Cassandra’s presentation, she offered a wealth of both theoretical and practical guidance on leveraging social media, podcasting, and YouTube to establish a meaningful personal brand that not only benefits one’s career but also contributes to the community. These platforms have evolved from simply being enjoyable ways to share our lives and connect with others to becoming essential tools for networking and career advancement. During the talk, attendees heard about individuals whose personal brands played a key role in their success as esteemed developers, managers, and community leaders. Participants learned how to utilize their online presence for career growth and received valuable insights on best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for striking a balance between professional and personal content.
In this presentation, Chris discusses the approach they devised for executing chaos engineering scenarios. The aim was to conduct exercises for new team members, acquainting them with alarms and the complete incident response procedure to ensure their preparedness for real situations. He demonstrated the rationale behind conducting such experiments, the design process, implementation, and ultimately, the evaluation and application of the solution.
This is a brief summary of some of the talks I attended. I’d like to thank the Devoxx team for organizing such a professionally-run conference. The audience was genuinely enthusiastic, and many valuable and meaningful conversations and connections took place. Be sure to visit Devoxx’s official website or Facebook page. I’ll attempt to share my impressions of the remaining talks in a future post.

What is Western Civilization and where did it come from?
This is the question I have been seeking answers to which has guided much of my reading. Today, those answers are coming from Jacob Howland’s book, Plato and the Talmud.
I first heard of the idea that Western Civilization is a combination of Athens and Jerusalem from Ben Shapiro in his book The Right Side of History. It made some sense to me then but the more I dig, the more sense it makes. There is a resistance for some people to understand and even admit that much of our culture is Biblically derived, but I don’t see any way around it.
At this point, I don’t think anyone can understand Western Civilization without an understanding of the Bible in the same way that we would expect them to understand Greek philosophy. And when someone tries to convince me otherwise, I take it as evidence that they don’t understand our civilization and will not until they get over that hump.
What Howland is doing in this book is comparing those two distinct lines of thought and describing their similarities and their differences.
One major difference which I have suspected is a key ingredient in the Bible missing from…

Before you start reading, I bet you’re wondering what exactly is a Perrucha: it is not any type of dog, or parrot (as in French), it is simply a term of endearment for those who feel independent, like to explore, to discover (and discover themselves), or what Charli XCX called a Brat. It means someone who is open minded and likes to have fun, and to mix with real people. If you’d like to visit only fancy places, there are other guides for you. When I visit a city, in Perrucha mode, I like to let the city tell a story, of the good and the bad sides, everything that makes it what it is.
As for Athens, you will se it has graffiti, the Acropolis, beautiful museums, sandy beaches, a vibrant music scene, an anarchist neighborhood, and one of the most welcoming people I have ever met. And just wait till you taste the food!
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home. Coming from a Latin American city, I believe it was the mix of beauty and chaos which won me over. Ever since, I’ve felt the need to return and keep exploring. I hope this guide will give you some tips that go beyond the main touristic areas and things to do, the same way I like to share my recommendations with my friends (this way I can also get them to read what I write).
If you are an international traveler, you will probably get to Athens by air -to the international airport Eleftherios Venizelos, commonly initialised as AIA-, or by sea -to Piraeus Port. If you get to the Port, you can easily take Line 3 to the city center, to the airport, or just get a taxi.
Going to the city center from the airport has quickly improved in the past 10 years, now you can just take the line 3 of the metro directly — approximated cost is 9€ per person. A trip to the city center (Syntagma Square), will take approximately 40 minutes. Uber is connected to the Taxi services, which you can also take to and from the airport.
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home…
You can order taxis via Uber and Freenow (only official taxis exist and use the meter), or take the metro/buses (as the metro won’t take you everywhere). The metro is quite clean and useful to get to and from the international airport.
In the Greek capital, I would say most of the people speak English, and all over Greece the road signs are in both Greek and English, I imagine because Greek is not so popular outside Greece. However, once you move to more retired places, having Google translate (or other apps) comes in handy, even if the younger generations speak English, you may find yourself ordering random items on the menu. In any case, people will most of the times be ready to help you, even if they don’t speak your language.
In short, with a metro card, basic English, and a positive attitude, you can easily move around.
You have two main areas you can choose from: enjoy the historical city center, or stay somewhere closer to the beach.
If you prefer the historical city center, you can try areas such as Plaka and Koukaki, which are walking distance to the Acropolis and full of restaurants and bars. You also have easy access to the metro. This areas are mainly touristic, especially Plaka; I personally prefer Koukaki for its chill vibes and it still walking distance to famous monuments like the Acropolis.
I would avoid areas such as Omonia and Monistiraki, even though they might offer cheaper options, they’re very busy and not as charming as other areas. The same goes for Pireas Port area, it’s not a place to hang out, unless you want to photograph ferries.
On a whole other vibe there is Exarcheia, the anarchist neighborhood. The neighborhood features a maze of architectural styles, bohemian shops, second-hand stores, record shops, and bookstores. Also amazing bars and restaurants for really good prices.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area. Since there is no metro to go there (there might be in the future), the closer you stay to the beach, the cheaper the taxi (duh). If you go further South, you can even visit Vouliagmeni Lake, also worth seeing.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area.
There is also an option in between the historical city center and the beaches: Paleo Firios, which is walking distance from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, an iconic building housing a library, an opera, a rooftop, and it’s a more residential neighborhood.
First and foremost, in Plaka neighborhood, go all the way up to the Acropolis. In front, instead of paying to enter the museum, which is empty (you can see the pieces in the British or Louvre Museums), just go to the museum restaurant and take pictures from there.
On Sundays see the change of guard in Syntagma Square.
Walk around Monastiraki square. See Filopapo’s hill (Socrates Prison) for the view (Colina Filopappou). If you have extra time you can go up the Mount Likavittos up the hill’s transport.
Walk around Exarcheia (the anarchist neighborhood) and discover the restaurants and cafés in a unique setting.
See Renzo Piano’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation if you can (on your way to Pireas port). The sunset from the rooftop bar is breathtaking. From June to August, you can also enjoy a free Open Air Cinema at night.
I insist for the beach lovers: make sure to check out the Vouliagmeni area, there’s even a Lake with a fancy spa. Most people skip the beaches in Athens, but to me they’re worth the visit, plus, the prices are quite affordable, even for the beach clubs.
There’s the small area of Mikrolimano next to the port with nice restaurants and a gorgeous view.
You can take a day trip to see the Delphos Oracle.
You can buy cosmetic products made with olive oil and honey. Just for the fun, go check out Greek pharmacies, they have the best natural cosmetics, a perfect souvenir.
For sports fans: you can visit the city’s multiple stadiums, be that the Olympic Complex built by renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Olympiacos F.C. Stadium near Pireaus, or the AEK Athens F.C. Agia Sophia Stadium in Nea Filadelfia. The locals I talked to are fervent fans of the AEK Athens F.C. and love the atmosphere.
A plus: a 40-minute drive from Athens, you can visit the APIVITA Cosmetics factory. If you’re my friend, you know I wish they would sponsor me since I use all of their products: they’re made of honey or olive oil. The factory visit is free of charge and you can buy their products at factory prices (located at Markopoulo Mesogaias).
Greece has rich culinary traditions and excellent quality ingredients, so it is not too hard to find good food, coffee and wine wherever you go. In my experience, Athens is one of the best cities in the world for cocktails, the attention to detail and creativity is impressive (also for the prices).
My personal favorites are the following:
· Fried cheese in all forms (cheese beignets, cheese pie)- the cheese can be Feta or Saganaki.
· Eel, squid and fish.
· Eggplant salad (spread).
· Greek salad Saganaki gambas (or anything in Saganaki -red- sauce).
· Mezze: small plates to share.
· Souvlaki (meat on a stick).
· Greek Yogurt with fruits, nuts and honey.
· Iced coffee: Greeks take iced coffee very seriously (as anyone should), hence you will have some of the best iced coffee, no matter the way you order it.
· Alcohol: most beers are pils, for darker beers try micro breweries (mostly in Athens).
· Grape liquors: Ouzo, Raki/Tsipouro — with or without Anis, Masticha, Wines.
Greece is a great place to be a vegetarian or vegan, as they have the well-known Mediterranean diet with fresh cheese, tomatoes, olives, cucumber and olive oil.
· Mpakaliarákia (Greek food) — Kidathineon 41
· Lolos — Geor. Olimpiou 5
· Mikrolimano area (Greek food) — 16, Akti Koumoundourou 24
· Try fried feta cheese with honey, moussaka (like lasagna), souvlaki (meat on a stick). Honestly everything is delicious.
· Drink Raki, Ouzo, Tsipouro (with or without anis), Rakómelo and Mastiha.
· six d.o.g.s — Avramiotou 6–8
· Neratzia Café Bistró (great wine bar) — Zan Moreas 6
· Tranzistor — Protogenous 10
· Baba au rum — Klitiou 6
· Rosalia — Valtetsiou 59
· Bolivar Beach Club — Leof. Poseidonos, Alimos 174 55
· Attic Urban Rooftop — Ermou 86
· Migniardise — Veikou 30
· Plaka is great for shopping for souvenirs such as clothes, magnets, food and cosmetics.
· Syd Records — Protogenous 13
· Athens Tattoo Studio — my favorite artist there is @boss_667ttt
· The prices are competitive, so look for the one closest to you and try it out.
Disclosure: make sure to check the listed places on Google Maps to see if they’re still running.
If you have anything you think I missed, feel free to share in the comments.
Having seen Athens, you can take a ferry and continue your trip to the islands, or take a train or car and see the inner part of the country.

Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP) is the largest water utility in Greece providing services to 4.3 million customers. Read how EYDAP is reducing water-energy nexus pressures.
By Robert C. Brears*
EYDAP has launched an ambitious program of renewable energy utilization with the objective of contributing to the optimization of the energy balance across the country and society and exploring the possibility of expanding to new profitable business. The water utility’s involvement in energy can be grouped into the areas of hydropower, cogeneration of heat and power, solar energy, and energy reduction initiatives.
Hydropower
Along the aqueduct system that brings raw water into the Athens area for treatment there are existing energy dissipation works (small waterfalls along the aqueduct). EYDAP is in process of converting these energy dissipation works into energy production plants, therefore taking advantage of the aqueducts’ hydropower potential. These energy production plants consist of temporarily redirected water flowing through a turbine that converts the hydraulic energy potential into electricity by use of a generator. The water then rejoins the aqueduct at a lower elevation and continues its flow to the water treatment plant. To date, EYDAP has constructed six small hydropower plants along its aqueducts located in Kirfi (760 kW), Elikona (650 kW), Kartala Kihairona (1,200 kW), Mandra (630 kW), Evinos Dam (820 kW), and Klidi (590 kW).
Cogeneration
At Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant, which receives 730,000 m³ of wastewater per day, biogas is captured to produce electricity and thermal energy at the Psyttalia heat and power cogeneration plants, with total wattage being 11.4 MWe and a thermal force of 17.3 MWth.
Solar energy
EYDAP has already licensed production for a photovoltaic power station that generates 1,971 MW on its premises of Aharnes. The contract will enable the selling of electricity to the Hellenic Electricity Officer. In addition, EYDAP is exploring the possibility of constructing smaller photovoltaic plants at other company locations.
Energy conservation
EYDAP has designed an intensive program of energy saving in buildings and facilities including energy inspections and energy saving advice. The utility is also undertaking preventative maintenance to achieve the best possible maintenance and extension of lifetime energy-intensive plant equipment to save energy. The overall aim of EYDAP is to save energy by maximizing the management of existing building equipment without making additional investments with excessive costs.
Multiple benefits
By developing renewable energy systems and undertaking energy conservation measures EYDAP is realizing multiple benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, additional income from trading carbon rights or green certificates, and new employment opportunities.
The take-out
By embracing renewable energy and energy conservation, water utilities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills, all the while offering employment opportunities.

The Greeks planted colonies widely, from Istanbul to Marseilles to Alexandria. And scattered all over the Mediterranean you will find remains of Greek temples (Wikipedia’s (incomplete) list notes 43 of them; it would be a good project for people to add to that list). But which — whether due to their preservation, or their setting, or their architectural value — are the best to visit? We’ve criss-crossed the Mediterranean in pursuit of the best, and we’re happy to share our list with you.
Overshadowed by the more spectacular Acropolis in Athens, the Hephaestion is under-appreciated. One of the very best preserved of all Greek temples (look at that ceiling!), it’s a must-see for any visitor to Athens. Set in a pleasant if slightly bland park — it’s easy to feel disconnected from the urban fabric of Athens here — it’s not difficult to find a shady place to watch the play of light on the temple’s myriad carved surfaces. Long known as the Theseum and a favorite of 19th century artists, it’s a must-see for lovers of ancient architecture.
In school you hear about Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns, but almost all the best-preserved Greek temples are Doric. At Didyma (Didim, in southwest Turkey) you’ll get your best opportunity to appreciate the Ionic: the Temple of Apollo Didymaios. Be prepared to be impressed: the temple’s platform is almost 400 feet long, and supported an incredible forest of 116 columns each more than six feet in diameter and 60 feet high. Admiring what is left, you begin to grasp the first reason why we have so little of the Ionic: these temples were lofty, ambitious structures. Sixty-foot columns don’t typically stand earthquakes, and when they fall, they shatter. But the Ionic style isn’t only to be admired for its size. These are some of the most elegant, beautiful ruins you will ever see: giant Medusa-heads watch over the ruins, exquisite reliefs ring the column bases, and everything is made of a gleaming marble whose beauty you have to see to believe. The vast temple enclosed an open-air court, where were kept a spring and laurel sacred to Apollo. Bring your Herodotus with you: the sanctuary — generally referred to as “Branchidae” by Herodotus, for the family that maintained the temple — was a key player in the Ionian Revolt, and Father of History recounts all the steps that led to its destruction in 494 B.C.
Delphi, easily reached from Athens, is one of the most touristed places in Greece. But it’ll take a lot more visitors to ruin this incredible mountain sanctuary. Tucked away in a valley the Greeks thought resembled a uterus (delphus), it’s still one of the most spectacular religious sites in the world. The views alone are worth the trip. And while the actual structure of the temple probably won’t overwhelm you, the significance of the place, and the weight of so much emotional human history — for centuries, people came here in the thousands literally looking for answers — still can be felt today. The famed objects are almost all gone — the wooden staff offered by Brutus, Rome’s first consul, or the rich gifts left by Croesus — but reading Pausanias’s account of them all will serve to remind you that this little mountain village was in many ways the spiritual center of the ancient world.
If you think Delphi’s mountain scenery is spectacular, wait til you try a visit to Bassae, a truly remote Greek temple atop a mountain literally in the middle of Arcadia. Most of the year you’ll probably have the place pretty much to yourself, too — if you can get there (it’s accessible only by car or by an expensive taxi). It may be the best-preserved Greek temple in the world, and as such has been the subject of much academic study (and the first to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Supposedly designed by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon, this temple’s beauty and harmony were singled out for praise by Pausanias almost two thousand years ago. And just to see those columns, still standing on that summit after all these centuries, is enough to give the pious traveller chills. The interior frieze was carted off to the British Museum in 1814, where you can still admire it (Mary Beard and John Henderson made the frieze the starting-point for their 2000 volume, Classics: A Very Short Introduction, a suitable companion for your journey in Arcadia).
This site might well have taken the top spot on our list were it not for the fact that in 1987 an enterprising preservationist decided the temple needed to be protected, and that the right way to protect it was to put it beneath a gargantuan latex tent. As you drive up the winding road it appears that the mountain is now crowned not by an extraordinary ancient temple but something rather like a Cyclops’ discarded condom. The temporary structure — which is remarkable-looking on the inside, I will confess — has now been there for almost thirty years. To make matters worse, at times the “preservation works” inside take up all the area inside the tent, and visitors are allowed to visit only the front face of the temple. What was once perhaps the most spectacular place in all Greece is now at times almost completely off limits. Not only that, but the tent has spawned a whole brood of conspiracy theories (“what exactly are they hiding up there? ALIENS?”). But a trip up to this three-thousand-foot-high ridge is to see just how spectacular the Greek architectural imagination could be.
The mountains of Greece are remarkable, but when you think of Greece, you think first and foremost of the sea. The most glorious religious manifestation of this is the temple of Poseidon at Sounion. On a sea-girt promontory jutting into the Aegean, almost every ship bound for Athens came within sight of this clifftop shrine. The structure is decidedly ruinous, but the spectacular setting is forever memorable (as is the signature from Byron carved into one of the pillars). The site history is not complex here — there has been the temple and the sea and the rock and not much else. On summer evenings a crowd gathers at the temple to watch the sunset, with a pleasant holiday vibe. It’s touristy, but the spot is still appreciably wild: I’ve hiked all over the promontory and even camped out there to get a little time alone with the beach.
Cumae is the place where Daedalus landed (without Icarus) after flying away from the Labyrinth, and his wings were supposedly kept in the temple of Apollo there. There’s not much left of the temple today — just the foundations — but the location on an abandoned hillside in Italy overlooking the Mediterranean is second to none. It’s the setting of Book Six of the Aeneid too, and reading Vergil’s lines on-location at the temple will give you shivers. Factor in the remarkable cave structure there, the Roman roads climbing the acropolis, and the temples of Zeus and Artemis nearby, and this is one of the best archaeological sites in the whole Mediterranean. It’s undiscovered too — the crowds all head to Pompeii and Naples just to the south.
Selinunte is one of a trio of top-notch Greek temple sites in Sicily (the other two are Segesta and Agrigento), all of which make our list. On a high plain overlooking the sea and flanked by golden beaches, it’s pretty easy to have a good time at Selinunte: mornings with the temples, afternoons at the beach, and evenings at the clubs. Not only that, but Selinunte boasts five major temple structures and several minor ones sprawling over the largest archaeological park in Italy. “Temple E” (generally presumed to be a temple of Hera) makes for the best pictures — it was re-erected using the original stones — but the whole site is interesting, especially if you can get there before temperatures start to soar.
Once the home of the great warrior Ajax, Aegina, just across the Saronic Gulf from Athens, doesn’t get the love that the more distant Greek islands get, but this temple of the mysterious “disappeared” Earth goddess Aphaia (aphaia means “not appearing”) is something special. It sits atop a hill overlooking the sea, on a quiet part of the island far away from the crowds. The temples of the Acropolis and Sounion are actually visible from here, and there may have been some kind of communication in antiquity from temple to temple with watchfires. The panorama is all big sky, old stone, and blue sea, an essence of Greece refined up through twenty-five hundred years. The temple itself is Doric, from around 500 B.C., and the sculptures from its pediment — now in Munich — stand, like the temple itself, right in that happy borderland between the Archaic Greek period and the full Classical style.
Strolling through the flowery hillsides, you might find it hard to imagine that Segesta once was a city. Almost nothing of the place remains, a fact which makes its two principal ruins all the more striking: an impressively preserved stone theater and an even more perfectly preserved Doric temple. You start by the temple, its unfluted columns aging to the color of sand and ochre; the Sicilian sun marks time’s every stroke upon the stone with a casting of shadow; landscaped grounds display the sun-loving Sicilian vegetation. A half-mile walk up the hill brings you to the theater, cunningly built as most of them are, splendidly preserved and following the line of the hill. Turning back to see the temple set among fields, with the waters of the Mediterranean in the distance and even further beyond, the endless hills of Sicily, you get one of the world’s most picturesque views. Thomas Cole selected precisely this view to produce one of his best Grand Tour keepsake paintings. Past and present seem to join hands here. Even today the temple looks almost brand-new, as if a team of builders threw it up in the past month and have just gone home for the day before coming back tomorrow to put on the roof and give it a final paintjob.
We know, we know, we know: the crowds can be awful, the sun is so glaring your eyes start watering without sunglasses, it’s beastly hot in summer, and parts of the place get roped off for no apparent reason. But it’s the Parthenon, and there’s a reason the crowds keep showing up. The most iconic image of Ancient Greece, the temple of Athena Parthenos is still a standout among Greek temples, for its incredible position at the center of Greece’s greatest city, for the Doric proportions perfectly poised between airy elegance and stony heft, for the gorgeous Pentelic marble that seems to mirror the color of the sun in the sky — pink at sunrise, blinding white at midday, honey-colored in the afternoon — and because it’s the Parthenon. This is the chief monument of “the school of Hellas,” the tangible remainder of Periclean Athens. It’s hard not to be impressed when you’re there. And there’s the rest of the Acropolis to see too — from the Erechtheum on top to the theater of Dionysus below (yes, that theater). There’s a reason why this is all a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’re better off going off-season, but no one who loves Greek temples is going to want to miss this one.
The Italians have chutzpah, and at times it pays off. The temples at Paestum, just south of the Amalfi Coast, face onto a road. There are businesses along the road: a few hotels, a few restaurants, a few bars. This could be a disaster. But it’s not: it’s delightful, and it makes visiting Paestum a real pleasure. The last time I was there I visited a bar where couples and friends were lined up at tables just staring at the sun setting over the Temple of Athena. It seemed like some kind of perfect dream of Mediterranean life. And it’s Italy: the restaurants are fabulous (they’re famous for their mozzarella di bufala), the bars are fabulous. There’s even a hair salon with a temple view. And the temples themselves? They are perfect. Their names have changed over generations, but the one now known as the Temple of Poseidon is one of the standout works of antiquity. The etching Piranesi completed of it — perfectly capturing the mystery of all things old — is perhaps the master’s greatest work. That Paestum comprises multiple temples, that they are so accessible, that there are perfect vantage points from which to draw or contemplate them, that the beach is so close, that the walls of the city form another remarkable attraction reachable by short walks through the fields, that they are visited but not overcrowded, that the place is easily accessed from the train — all these things make a visit to Paestum one of the very best ways to experience Greek temple architecture.
Grand as all the temple sites of Magna Grecia are — Paestum, Segesta, and Selinunte are all on this list — the grandest of them all is Agrigento, the ancient Akragas, where a walk through a grove of almond and olive leads you from magnificent Greek temple to magnificent Greek temple, all of them perched on an impossibly photogenic ridge. The site is hot in summer but truly beautiful all throughout the year, thanks to the warm climate, sea views, and some gorgeous Mediterranean landscaping. The bloom of the almond trees in February is particularly stunning, and the wonderful spread of the site makes it a perfect botanical garden — it’s almost as if the ancients spaced out their temples to cater to the tourist experience.
The so-called Temple of Concordia is the star attraction, a splendidly preserved Doric temple in a warm buff stone, but the site boasts seven temples, all of which are worth visiting, and much besides: the remains of an “Atlas,” part of the temple of Zeus, shows its utterly unique temple design. Alone of all the Greek sites in Italy, the Valley of the Temples has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status. The adjacent town of Agrigento is a kind of miniature Sicily in itself, with ancient, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and modern buildings in a kind of glorious jumble. Olives, sunshine, sculpture, blossom, wine-dark sea, history laid upon history: if you want to get the experience of an ancient Greek temple, it’s pretty hard to beat Agrigento.
You don’t have to choose just one, of course. The best is to find a way to see them all. Have a favorite we left off our list? Feel free to add it in the comments.

(TW: Sexual Assault. Please read with care. Thank you.)
There were none wiser, stronger, or better than her, Athena, the Goddess of wisdom and strength, knew. Victory flowed fresh in her blood of gold — ichor. She had just won the battle of being the patron God of Athens and won from whom but her uncle, the God of the Waters himself! However, she knew Poseidon’s propensity to hold grudges. An attack could be on the way anytime soon. The caution did not stop her from savoring her spoils as her hungry eyes wandered over the capital, looking for a new conquest to engage her. Mortals could be the most entertaining species. Amidst the cacophony of the cosmopolitan city — hawkers crying, officials announcing, and buyers haggling, a mellifluous voice struck her ears.
“Goddess Athena!”
Few things managed to take Athena aback. The woman’s beauty happened to be one of them. Long, golden hair tumbled on her dusky face, which was adorned with a dainty nose and full, red lips. Her white robe contrasted against her skin. The woman was kneeling in the exquisitely built temple of marble, which had been devoted to the Goddess. The mortal continued to heap praises. Well aware of the protocol, the golden-haired maiden stood and draped an embroidered silver robe on Athena’s statue. Divine rays emanated from the statue as Athena deigned to appear in the temple.
“Goddess!” the woman gasped, falling on her knees.
“Rise, maiden.” Athena’s rich, deep voice reverberated in the temple. “What is your name, and whence do you come from?”
“Medusa is my name,” the mortal’s silky voice said. “I am the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto, minor lords of the sea.”
Athena’s eyes hardened. “Lords of the sea, you say?”
“The sea, Goddess. But I am here to devote my heart and soul to your service. I want to be the first priestess of this temple.”
Medusa looked into Athena’s eyes. A sudden current passed in the space between them. The mortal must have felt the exchange of sparks too, for she looked away, red rushing to her cheeks. Athena noticed the blueness of those frail mortal eyes — eyes that were bluer than the sky and deeper than the ocean. Yet, another factor attracted her. Those eyes seemed to contain intelligence and consideration more than most men.
“Answer me, then. What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?”
Medusa did not take time to think. “The answer should be a human. In the morning of life — our childhood — we crawl on all fours. At noon, which is adulthood, we walk upright on two legs. In the evening of our lives, we use a cane as a third leg.”
“Born of the earth, yet a gift divine,I thrive where the sun and soil align.A token of peace, a feast I provide,In oil or fruit, I’m prized worldwide.What am I?”
Medusa smiled in recognition. “Your gift to us, Goddess, what else? The people of Athens chose this over Poseidon’s salt water. They are your divinely provided olives.”
Athena continued to grill the woman — on policy, on Gods, on anthropology. Each answer seemed better than the previous and drew Athena closer, till she could hear the mortal’s breaths. Athena knew her presence overwhelmed mortals, yet the maiden held her ground.
“Last question for today,” Athena said.
“I cannot be seen, yet I color your view,I cannot be touched, yet I’m felt through and through.I can bind the mighty, or make the meek bold,A treasure eternal, yet never bought or sold.What am I?”
Athena watched Medusa’s lips as she spoke. “The answer is love, Goddess. The best and the worst feeling in the world.”
A rush of power hit Athena; a unique exhilaration and euphoria made their way to her heart. She could appreciate beauty with brains; she could appreciate a challenge. Medusa remained on her knees, awaiting the judgment.
“Call an official,” said Athena. “I have an important announcement to make.”
And so, one of Athena’s first and grandest temples in Athens got the perfect priestess. The duties, the offerings, and the devotion were at a level unseen by Athena before. At the dawn of every week’s first day, Athena used to appear in the temple to meet the priestess. The Goddess posed riddles, discussed the recent developments in Olympus, or simply shared silence with the mortal. Those times energized the Goddess more than ambrosia could. During those conversations, butterflies flew in Athena’s stomach, and she could see the yearning in the mortal’s eyes. For the time being, she decided to keep her distance and tease the mortal some more. The bountiful sparks added a new flavor to her life.
She looked forward to them eagerly.
Medusa swayed her way to the temple from her home. The sun was rising, the sea reflecting the sky’s oranges and pinks beautifully. A smile touched her lips. Maybe, today would be the day that Athena would close the distance between them. Perhaps Athena was waiting for her to make the move. After all, who would appreciate bravado more than her?
Today, Medusa decided. Today I would say it all.
Just then, drizzle began. Medusa increased her pace, knowing the temple was still a stretch away. Her gut was pounding. A shadow fell on her shoulder. The scent of salt water hit her nose.
“Young lady,” said a hoarse voice. “I have seen none finer than you.”
Medusa turned and gasped. A muscular man with blue robes and dark, long hair towered over her. Yet, he looked more ugly than desirable to her. She clutched her white robe, which told the world that she was devoted to Athena.
“God Poseidon,” Medusa managed to say. “T-thank you for your compliments. I was headed to Goddess Athena’s temple.”
Medusa immediately knew that was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone in Poseidon’s eyes. As he took a step forward, she took a step back, her hands quivering.
Athena, she prayed, over and over. Athena.
Clouds grew darker over her. Huge waves began forming in the sea and crashing over the coast. It seemed that the God grew in size. Medusa fell backwards. Her heart pounded loudly.
“Are you denying the chance to be with me, young lady? Isn’t your name Medusa? Aren’t you the daughter of minor lords under ME?”
“Have mercy,” Medusa said, slithering backwards. “Mercy, Lord, I apologize, I am already devoted to Goddess Athena. ATHENA.”
Thunder crackled. Poseidon fell on her, twisting her arm, making her turn over. Medusa went numb. A golden light flashed somewhere. Poseidon cursed. Momentarily, the weight was removed from her. Through her tears and blood, Medusa saw two great lights clashing. A shrill shriek dominated the air. In horror, she realized Poseidon was coming towards her again as a wounded beast. She tried to stand. A force other than Poseidon hit her then, throwing her back. Poseidon cursed again, his shout shaking the ground. A cold, brutal wave crashed on her. The last thing Medusa was aware of was Athena’s tear-stricken face.
It seemed that she had been unconscious for ages. The ground was hard below, and there was a constant hissing around. When the memories set in, Medusa sat up straight and horrified.
Was it a dream?
She found herself in a cave overlooking the sea. Looking around, she was shocked to see her cousins — the Gorgons — sleeping in the corner. Perhaps Athena had made them guard her. They had their hair as hundreds of tiny snakes, their faces grey and what was generally considered monstrous. The hissing of their snakes filled her head. There was a small pool of water on the other end of the cave. Feeling the thirst, Medusa wandered towards it. Her reflection was not something she was prepared for. That was why the hissing sounded too loud. Her scream was loud enough to disturb the sea.When her throat could scream no more, her ears caught the sound of sobbing. Even without turning, Medusa knew who the person was. Pain like no other twisted in her heart.
“Medusa,” said Athena, her voice cracking. Medusa turned. When once those blue eyes glittered at the sight of the Goddess, now there was only blankness.
Medusa opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. She closed her eyes, hot tears splashing on her cheeks. Whatever had happened had to be a dream. Soon, her body was rocked by hefty sobs. Athena kept apologizing in the background, her eyes as red and swollen.
“If only I had claimed you sooner,” said Athena. “Would that have made a difference?” The Goddess crawled closer to Medusa, whom she had transformed into another Gorgon. “I am sorry, Medusa. I am sorry. I love you. This seemed the only viable solution to drive Poseidon away.” The Goddess gulped. “I could not defeat him.”
Looking at Medusa’s defeated face, Athena grabbed her shoulders, her voice betraying the pain she felt. “Tell me.
“I linger unseen, a shadow in light,I burden the heart, both day and night.I grow with your secrets, thrive on your pain,I bind you in chains, yet leave no stain.What am I?”
Medusa finally stared in the grey eyes. “Guilt.”
Slowly, legends about Medusa spread.
Some of them claimed that she could turn people into stone just by looking at them. Heroes began to seek her out, to win the confidence and support of people around. Medusa’s peaceful life began to be poked at again, by men. Athena knew she had to do something. Every time she thought of the incident, a knife twisted in her chest. Soon, a quiet trip to Hades was made. As depressing and spooky as the underworld was, Athena knew it was the path to Medusa’s salvation. Hades was hard to bargain with, but the presence of Persephone helped. Promptly, two gilded swords that held the power to never miss a strike were transported to Hades. His part of the bargain would come later.
In the meanwhile, a young and promising hero named Perseus, the son of Zeus, was rising in popularity.
One night, Athena paid a visit to him and whispered his task. He had to behead Medusa as painlessly as possible and bring the head to the Goddess. Perseus did not question the specifics and accepted a shield for the task, a shield that shone brighter than gold, that reflected better than a mirror. The hero set off. Athena helped him whenever she could without making it obvious, until he reached the infamous Rock Island.
Athena watched with bated breath.
The day of the final encounter arrived. Perseus entered the cave in the middle of the day. That was usually the time when the Gorgons slept. The statues of people around did not help his nerves. He gripped the shield tightly, a royal sword hanging by his waist, and tiptoed where Medusa slept. The unevenness of the ground made him fumble. He tripped, making the other statues around him crash to the ground. Then, it was deathly silent. His heart stopped as he heard the snarl of Medusa, the hissing of her snakes.
The moment she turned to him, he lifted the shield.
Medusa faltered. Perseus, his eyes closed, swung his sword, praying his strike was right. He heard a thing plop to the ground. Daring to look up, he saw the headless body of Medusa collapsing. The other Gorgons came for him, but Perseus made a dash, dodging over the fallen statues, managing to take the head of Medusa with him.
When the hero was back in his kingdom, Athena paid a visit to him. Perseus handed over the head and the shield back as promised.
After blessing him, she returned to her abode. In the space of her own, she fused the head of her lover with the shield. As she did the task, she knew it would be one of the deadliest weapons. Any ill-intentioned onlooker would be turned to stone through its use. A maiden in trouble could lift the weapon and fight off the attacker easily. Athena went on to keep it safely in the temple where Medusa had reigned for months.
Guilt still weighed heavy in Athena’s chest — no longer did she feel as mighty or as wise.
Yet, Medusa’s hearty afterlife in Elysium — courtesy of Hades — managed to ease some of it. After three attempts of visiting her, Medusa had finally made conversation with her. It had been short, but it was the only thing that had healed some part of Athena.
“Athena,” Medusa had said.
“I am a bridge that mends the torn,A balm where wounds and pain are born.I free the heart, untie the chain,And bring the sun through clouds of rain.
What am I?”
Athena had bowed her head to the spirit, experiencing the bittersweetness of the moment. “Medusa, the woman who opened my eyes and my heart, the answer is forgiveness.”

No other ancient city is as alive for us as Athens at the time of Socrates. Written sources are plentiful, and we do have a lot of Archaeological evidence — especially remarkable are the painted ceramics, showing the inhabitants of Athens in their houses, at the gymnasium, at war and all their other activities. All this allows us to use Plato’s Dialogues as a guide: skipping over the philosophical discussions, together with Socrates, we stroll through the city and enter the houses of its inhabitants.
Socrates reports: ‘At the earliest stages of dawn, Hippocrates came and started beating at my door with his stick; a slave opened the door for him, and he came rushing in and yelled out: Socrates, are you awake or asleep? [Hippocrates brings the news that Protagoras is in town and wants to visit him right away.] ‘Let’s not go there now, my good friend, it’s too early. But let’s go out into the courtyard here and spend the time until sunrise strolling around out…

A walk through history as you tour mill ruins, historic homes, and a battleground at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site.
The site is located about three hours north of St. Louis near the Iowa border.
We first stopped at the former Athens, Mo., General Store. The building is open to the outdoors and now serves as a picnic shelter. Inside you can read signs that describe the history of the store. It was once at the corner of Spring and Thome Street along a path that went down to the ferry that once crossed the Des Moines River.
A nearby sign shows the town at its height from 1853–1860 when it was an important port along the river pre-Civil War.
Next, we saw a monument explaining that the Battle of Athens on Aug. 5, 1861, was the northernmost Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River.
First, a short history lesson to better understand what happened here. Athens prospered until the outbreak of the Civil War. Settled by people from the upper South. Considered by Unionists to be a hotbed of pro-South sentiment. As the spring of 1861 moved into summer, northeast Missourians began choosing sides in the ever-widening national conflict.
Pro-Unionists rallied around David Moore, who had raised a force of about 500 men. Moore entered and occupied Athens on July 24, seizing homes and businesses from pro-South supporters to quarter and provision his troops. Pro-South supporters rallied around Col. Martin Green. Green raised a force of about 3,000 men, including two of Moore’s sons.
The confrontation between Moore’s and Green’s forces took place in Athens on Aug. 5, 1861. The battle began around 5 a.m. Moore and his Unionists were surrounded on three sides by Green’s troops, with the Des Moines River to their rear.
Despite being outnumbered at least five to one, Moore’s men were better trained and equipped.
After about two hours of fighting, at least 50 soldiers had been wounded or killed and the pro-South side was demoralized and in full retreat.
The big loser in the battle was the town of Athens. Bitter feelings between neighbors continued for decades following the Civil War. Athens was also hurt by the shift from the river to railroad transportation in the post-war era. By 1900, the once-thriving town was nearly gone.
(From the Battle of Athens State Historic Site website)
Along a former road, we went by a white picket fence surrounding a foundation. In front, a sign explains what happened after the battle.
A sign in front of the Benning House talks about the forming of Union troops in Northeast Missouri.
We happened to be up at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site when they were conducting tours so the historic homes were open to the public. I would call first to see if they are doing tours before you drive to the site if you want to see the inside of them.
Bedrooms are set up to that period including chamber pots, beds, a chest of drawers, and cabinets along with stoves.
My son pointed out the large piano and a nearby violin.
Fascinating were the intricate details of the patchwork quilt with ducks and even an 1800s girl with schoolbooks.
We then saw the large apple peeler at the end of a cabinet in the kitchen.
The most intriguing aspect of the house is the hole a cannonball left through the kitchen door, through the kitchen, and out the other wall. Although the cannonball harmed no one.
The cannonball fired from the artillery of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard hit the house during the Aug. 5, 1861 battle.
Next, we walked up the road to the Smith Hotel.
Here we found a weaver machine from the 1800s.
A corkboard had photos from the 1800s giving you a sense of the people and houses that were in the town back then.
Andrew checked out the rifles and guns on display.
Next, we walked out to the back where a large cannon is set up on the former battleground. Andrew stood in the back like he was about to fire it.
Then we walked over by the brick Moreland House and Wm. S. French House, abandoned homes in the town.
Next, we went down to the sign for the Mill Trail, which says it is a .3-mile one-way walk. Although, you can do it as a loop since the trail curves back up the hill a short way after passing the mill. This is also shown on the printout of the Mill Trail from the historic site’s website. The total walk is a .4-mile natural surface loop.
Heading down the wide mowed path we pass a ravine that goes into trees.
I spy a white mushroom growing on part of a log.
Below the hill, the trail goes to the left and we saw the brown rock mill remains. These remnants were from a mill constructed by Edward Colton. Built to withstand ice and flooding and stood on a 30-foot stone foundation with an additional four stores and had a water wheel. It was a grist and textile mill until the 1890s.
After checking out the mill we walked a short way along the river before coming to a trail that headed back up the hillside. You could continue along the river, but this is an unlisted trail.
At the top, you can take the White Connector trail to the 2.8-mile natural surface Snow Trillium Trail that goes along the river hills.
We headed back up into the former town to check out the Athens Mill Overlook boardwalk.
This is a good way to see the mill site without having to go down and up the river hill.
Along the boardwalk, you can also see remains of brown rock structures in the woods.
If you like history and ghost towns then this is a worthy trip to make if you are in northeast Missouri. A lot of history in a small area.
A fishing lake, picnic areas, and a playground.
Call 660–877–3871 for more information or to schedule a tour.
Drive: A little over three hour’s drive from the St. Louis Metro. Take Interstate 64 or Interstate 70 to U.S. 61 and go north. North of Wayland, Mo., make a left onto Missouri Highway C then a right onto Missouri Highway 81, and then a right onto Missouri Highway CC that leads to the historic site.
Hours: 7 a.m. — sunset, daily, year-round
Address: State Hwy CC, Revere, MO 63465
A national Civil War battlefield, a frog-shaped rock, and a devil’s elbow are some of what can be seen on the way from St. Louis to Branson!
Dennis Schick Trail includes historic sites and war machinery such as a World War II Sherman Tank in Jefferson Barracks Park in St. Louis County.
If you are heading up to Iowa City from St. Louis another stop is the Swinging Bridge in Columbus Junction, Iowa.
In Columbus Junction, Iowa, you can walk along a swinging bridge that is 262 feet above a dark ravine shrouded in a jungle-like forest.

Athens
Athens, Greece; June 13, 2019
Where to start. It’s so vulnerable to put writing– my ideas materialized for literally anyone to read– out on the internet. Yet, I feel like I need to start blogging. I mean, one day, this will be amazing to read and remember all the details of my life that are so present now. But not only that. I hope you guys (even if the only person reading is my mom) enjoy what you read and take something away from this.
OK. Time to get into what you’re here to read. Greece. Honestly, Greece is a logistical nightmare. Now, don’t get me wrong. Actually being in Greece is incredible. But, the getting there… now that’s a headache. Flying anywhere in Europe is an 8 hour flight or more– that’s a given. But to get to Santorini, it takes a flight from Nashville to New York and then another flight to Athens and then a ferry to the island. That adds up to be almost 24 hours of travel straight. A logistical nightmare. Planning the flights and ferries, doing time change and travel time math… needless to say we were exhausted when we arrived in Athens that first day. We had our ferry to Mykonos booked for the next morning, planning to spend one night in Athens to split up the day of travel. But, when in Athens, you have to visit the Parthenon. So what did we do that day? We visited the Parthenon.
Nashville’s Parthenon had not prepared me for the hike up to and the heat that encompassed the Grecian Parthenon. It was in the upper 90s when we went to the Parthenon, and I was sweating buckets. The Parthenon is on top of this huge peak in Athens, which is amazing in the sense that at the top, you can see a 360* view of the city. But on the other hand, the peak is that much closer to the sun, making walking around on the pavement surrounding the Parthenon feel like you are cooking on a hot grill. The view at the top was insane. Humbling. We could see the entire city below us, seeing the true insignificance of ourselves in the grand scheme of life. Yet, I also felt so important in that moment. The fact that I had traveled so many miles and was lucky enough to experience such an out-of-body moment in the most beautiful country I’d ever been, with the people I loved the most- it was a feeling I can’t find the words to describe.
We made our way down the mountainside (is it a mountain? I don’t really know… maybe a really big hill?) to find ourselves famished. In Europe, the restaurants operate way different from American ones. For one, there are rows and rows of restaurants directly next to each other, all with menus out front and all outdoor seating. Imagine Downtown Franklin, but no indoor seating and all the tables extended into the sidewalk. Also, you have to sit suuuuuper close to the people next to you in Europe when you eat. These are both due to the lack of space and expensive real estate in European cities. See, there are no skyscrapers in Europe; the restaurants are in original buildings. So, when searching for a restaurant, you can see the entire thing from the street and you kind of know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.
We walked down street upon street of crowded restaurants, searching for one that could accommodate the 5 of us and seemed to serve ~gluten free and vegan~ food. We finally found this one, which was literally the first one we saw and somehow skipped. This restaurant was at the foot of the Parthenon, with an incredible view of the Acropolis from below. (It’s called Athina Bistrot, if any of you are ever in Athens and need an amazing restaurant!) We were seated among locals, all of whom were enjoying casual coffee and business meetings amidst our day of tourism.
Another thing about Europe: they don’t serve you water. Ok, that’s dramatic. They do serve you water. But not in the way American restaurants do. Let’s take dinner at Cheesecake Factory for example. You sit and the waiter brings you a glass of water initially, refills when they bring you bread, refills when getting your food order, and again fills your glass when the food comes. And that’s not even including dessert. But in Europe, you have to ask for water and for refills. And the water comes from a glass bottle they leave at your table to refill. And here’s the catch: they charge you for each bottle. So, it is likely that one is dehydrated the majority of the time they are abroad. That being said, my family finished six. Let me repeat. Six bottles of water. Before we had even been served. We were parched–to say the least. Our waiter and the others dining in the restaurant found us comical- the group of 5 American tourists guzzling down upwards of $30 in water.
Our waiter. The reason I am writing this today. Actually, he and I are friends on Facebook so he may see this. So, if you’re reading this, Nikitas– hey! Nikitas was quite the conversationalist. His English was really good, so we were able to chat with him whilst inhaling our Greek salads. Every so often, I would look over into the kitchen to see Nikitas looking fondly at my family.
Every few minutes, Nikitas would come over to our table to check on us and start up a conversation about everything– to life in America and what we had planned for our trip. Here’s another thing about Europe that’s important to know here: they don’t give you the check. Again, I’m being dramatic. They do give you the check. But, in America, the minute you finish eating your food, they give you the check. This table turnover is the way American restaurants operate. The sooner they get you in and out, the more tables they can seat and the more tips they can make. But in Europe, they don’t give you the check immediately, you have to ask for it. European culture centers around eating and community, so the waitstaff don’t rush you out. Secondly, the restaurants in Europe stay open until the early morning hours, so there is not really a rush from the waiters to kick each table out. That being said, we sat at that table for hours sipping on our bottled waters and chatting with Nikitas.
Towards the end of our meal, Nikitas came by again. This time, he told us about his life. He was a single father raising his son, a son he saw as his world. He told us about the countless hours he worked just to make sure his son was well cared for. When Nikitas talked about his son, his eyes sparkled and he beamed. He opened up about how he envied the closeness of our family and how he loved seeing us together, happy.
That one hit home. I realized the true value of the moment I was living. I had all of my family together, at one table, in the most beautiful country, and here’s the kicker. We were happy. I began to think about how this moment was fleeting. Some day I would look back on this moment with such nostalgia, such joy. I felt a twinge of sadness, I knew I would miss this moment and I was currently living in it. Nostalgia for the present is such a powerful thing. I missed this moment before it was even over.
This idea taught me to hold on much tighter to what I experience that is good. I now feel as though I collect moments and memories, rather than let them pass idly by. I have grown to miss moments whilst living them, knowing the exact laughs and conversations are irreplaceable. And after my whole life, not stopping to realize the impermanence memories, it took Nikitas, a waiter in Athens to teach me. I took that lesson and ran. I lived that trip with the intention to remember and cherish every moment.
We left Athens the next morning and embarked on two weeks of Grecian life in Mykonos and Santorini. And trust me, the stories I have about the rest of the trip will be told in their entirety on future blog posts… Get excited ;)
Back to logistics. A ferry back to Athens was the first leg of the trip back home to Nashville. Again, we stayed in Athens for a night before we took a flight to New York and then another one to Nashville. When we arrived in Athens, I knew there was one thing I wanted to do. Eat at that restaurant.
My family and I made our way back to the restaurant he worked at– hoping he would be our waiter again. He was there. A reminder of the fleeting nature of the present and the necessity of cherishing every moment.

Athens is an iconic city with a huge history. I’ve always dreamed of going there and this article will help you enjoy this.
Also, remember that I’m also writing on Medium and that it is very important for me growing a huge community over here so please go and follow my channel with this link : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Athens, the capital of Greece, is a dynamic metropolis in southeastern Europe. With an area of around 39 km², it is relatively small compared to other European capitals, but its cultural and historical wealth makes it a place of exceptional importance.
In 2021, Athens had a population of around 664,046, making it Greece’s most populous city. It is the country’s political, economic and cultural center. The city is famous for its emblematic ancient monuments, including the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the ancient Agora, which bear witness to its rich historical heritage.
Athens is divided into several districts, but has no official arrondissements like some other metropolises. The city has a complex administrative organization, with subdivisions such as districts, municipalities and suburbs.
Geopolitically, Athens is of strategic importance due to its geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea. It plays a central role in Greece’s politics and economy, as well as in the region’s international relations. The city is home to numerous government institutions, embassies and international organizations.
In addition to its historical heritage, Athens is also renowned for its Mediterranean cuisine, lively neighborhoods, colorful markets and vibrant nightlife. Visitors can explore its museums, theaters and art galleries, as well as enjoy the breathtaking views from the Acropolis hill.
Athens, with its fascinating blend of past and present, is a must for travelers seeking history, culture and the excitement of a major European city.
Athens has a rich history stretching back thousands of years, with roots deeply rooted in Greek mythology. Here’s a summary of key moments in the city’s history from its legendary beginnings.
Athens takes its name from the Greek goddess Athena, who is said to have won a contest with Poseidon to become the city’s protector. According to legend, she gave the city an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity, and thus Athens was born.
The first traces of human occupation in Athens date back to the Bronze Age, around 3000 BC. At that time, it was a small farming community.
Athens developed during the Archaic period (800–500 BC), becoming a powerful city-state with a system of government based on nascent democracy.
The 5th century BC is often referred to as Athens’ Golden Age. Under the leadership of Pericles, the city flourished culturally, politically and economically. It was during this period that monuments such as the Parthenon were built.
Athens played a crucial role in the Median Wars (490–479 BC), repelling the Persian invasion and consolidating its position in Greece.
Athens was embroiled in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), a devastating conflict with its rival Sparta. This war weakened Athenian power.
In 338 BC, Athens fell under the domination of Philip II of Macedon, then his son, Alexander the Great.
After the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens lost some of its political importance, but became a cultural center of the Roman Empire.
Under the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, Athens continued to be a prosperous city, although it suffered barbarian invasions and unrest over the centuries.
From the 15th century onwards, Athens fell under Ottoman domination, a period that lasted until the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century.
The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) led to the liberation of Athens and the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830.
Contemporary times: Since independence, Athens has become the capital of Greece, playing a key role in the country’s political, cultural and economic development. It hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has continued to thrive as a cultural and intellectual center.
Today, Athens remains a crossroads of history and culture, bearing witness to its long and fascinating history from its modest mythological beginnings to its status as a dynamic, modern metropolis.
Athens is packed with historic, cultural and picturesque sites to discover as a tourist. Here are ten must-see places to visit when you’re in Athens:
This is Athens’ most emblematic site, home to the majestic Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Theater of Dionysus. The Acropolis offers a panoramic view of the city.
This historic site is home to ancient temples, stelae and monuments. It was the heart of public life in Athens in ancient times.
This world-renowned museum displays an impressive collection of artifacts and sculptures from the Acropolis, providing a valuable backdrop to a visit to the site itself.
Watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony in front of the Parliament building on Syntagma Square. The building itself is a magnificent example of neoclassical architecture.
Explore the winding, picturesque streets of Plaka, one of Athens’ most charming districts, with its boutiques, tavernas and colorful houses.
This museum houses a vast collection of ancient artifacts, including sculptures, jewelry and archaeological treasures, offering a comprehensive overview of Greek history.
Climb to the top of this hill for breathtaking panoramic views of Athens, especially at sunset.
Visit this lively district for its flea market, cafés, vintage stores and the famous Monastiraki square.
Discover this ancient marble stadium, which was restored to host the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
If you have time, take a trip outside Athens to admire the temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, located on the seafront and offering spectacular views of the Aegean Sea.
These sites offer a comprehensive overview of the history, culture and beauty of Athens, giving you an unforgettable experience in this fascinating city.
A world-renowned Greek philosopher, Plato was the founder of the Academy of Athens, one of the world’s first institutions of higher learning. His philosophical dialogues, notably “The Republic”, have influenced Western thought for centuries.
A pupil of Plato, Aristotle was another renowned philosopher from Athens. His contributions to philosophy, biology, politics and metaphysics had a lasting impact on many disciplines.
Athenian historian, Thucydides is the author of “The Peloponnesian War”, a detailed account of the war between Athens and Sparta. His work is considered a masterpiece of history and politics.
An influential Greek politician, Venizelos was Prime Minister of Greece four times in the early 20th century. He played a major role in the reforms and political events of his era, including the Balkan Wars and the First World War.
Actress and politician, Melina Mercouri was a passionate cultural ambassador for Greece. She won the Prix d’interprétation féminine at the Cannes Film Festival in 1960 for her role in “Jamais le dimanche” and served as Greece’s Minister of Culture, fighting for the restitution of the Parthenon marbles.
These Athens personalities have left a lasting imprint in fields ranging from philosophy to politics to cinema, helping to shape the history and culture of Greece and the world.

In early 2019 I took a leap of faith and moved to Los Angeles to pursue my own, American dream. There, while working two jobs to make ends meet, I made a painful realisation: the industry that I had been born into, the industry of hospitality, is not the one that makes my heart skip a beat.
While still in the city of angels, I stumbled upon jetdrops’ job opening and I sent my CV. A couple of Skype interviews and a transatlantic flight later, here I am, sitting on my desk with my fancy new title: Communications Specialist & PR Executive.
Some people might say I kicked “an opportunity of a lifetime” by coming back to Athens, Greece. I returned extremely driven and determined to get out of my comfort zone and pursue my desire: a career in the communication field. It is a personal challenge, an investment on my own self and I am ready to face all the consequences with unapologetic confidence.
I still remember how nervous I was while preparing for my first day. I wanted to look professional and considered as an equal team member from my colleagues. My black work pants, a casual white shirt and my blue loafers were my best allies. Soon after arriving in the office, I realised my outfit plays a minimal role and everyone here speaks through their work.
After a typical “first day in the office”, where I met the rest of the team and got a brief introduction to my duties, I recall my bizarre feelings while walking home: it probably was a mixture of utter excitement and… panic; a mixture that even today, cannot fully decode & understand.
This was not your typical 9–5 job, full of judgemental supervisors or surrounded by people who hate their jobs. jetdrops is an environment of regulated individual autonomy that operates with a common purpose: build projects that make the team proud and the client happy. And if not anything else, I had come to respect their commitment and work of ethic. Thus I could not help but feel intimidated since I had yet, nothing to offer to the table.
Despite the fact that I have very little experience working in an advertising & communications agency, terms like “press release”, “media kit” and “brand awareness” were not foreign to me. However, understanding their practical meaning has in fact proven to be extremely crucial.
My manager and mentor, Dora Papakonstantopoulou, has been a catalyst that will determine my future in this field. My learning process has been expedited; reporting, research, project management and aligning with internal and external stakeholders have been in my place since day one. Before my second week came to an end, I had already organised and facilitated the internal process of an upcoming campaign’s brainstorming.
Having such an overall sense of responsibility is the kind of position I have been dreaming for and, despite my limited experience, I am determined to validate my efforts. My choice of leaving la-la land was a risk that was meant to be taken and I fully agree with Jim Rohn:
If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.

Clear your calendar on May 22, 2023, and prepare yourself for the trial of the millennium. And it’s not the one you’re thinking of. This particular event has been in the making for about two thousand years.
The one and only Socrates has received a second day in court, in front of The National Hellenic Museum (NHM) in Chicago of all places
Honestly, I’d convict him again, but my opinion isn’t popular.
The gut reaction for most is an easy win for the defense. After all, Socrates is likely one of the most beloved figures in the history of philosophy. As law student and history scholar Theodoros Karasavvas at Ancient Origins points out:
“His death was a dark moment in Athenian and human history, but his thinking and teachings have survived as a beacon of light for almost 2,500 years.”
Karasavvas also reminds us “for all his greatness and popular acclaim, Socrates had fanatic enemies as well,” mainly for his “powers of persuasion” and “opposition to authority.”
Like many have stated before, he calls the original case “one of the saddest cases of a miscarriage of justice…

A literary translation of my thoughts on cities, public spaces, urbanism etcetera.

This one came to me as a volunteer assignment from Laneway Project, a nonprofit organisation in Toronto that works to convert laneways to vibrant public spaces. As researcher and writer, I was asked to study best practices in laneway projects across the world and write about any one of them. Since another volunteer had already researched examples from the US & Australia, I was left to get more creative and research about lesser known examples from the non-English-speaking world.
There were four projects that were interesting to study — the Dashilar project in Beijing that revived a traditional urban hutong in the city; the revival of Gaengeviertel in Hamburg by artists and citizens to prevent its demolition; a project called BioUrban in Sao Paulo led by a sociologist who lived and worked in a favela to develop a sense of stewardship among the favela dwellers and lastly, Atenistas — a citizen group in Athens that is run exclusively by volunteers to regenerate dead spaces in Athens and make people fall in love (again) with Athens.
Tough as it may be, I had to choose one of these projects to write on. I think what really pulled me towards Atenistas was the community spirit and love for the city they seemed to be injecting into Athens and its people. And so, I began to write about them. To read the article, click here.

A week ago, we drove 30 kilometers to Athens. We had to do a hospital check-up, which turned out to finish quickly.
It was broad daylight in Athens at that time, and we didn’t feel like driving back 30 kilometers to home immediately. So, we decided to do something in the city. We had plenty of time until dusk.
There were several Asian restaurants in Athens with cuisine that I wanted to taste. Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, and Indonesian foods were among the options I was curious about. To kill time, we therefore opted to have lunch at an Asian restaurant.
After comparing the opening hours of several restaurants, we finally picked an Indonesian restaurant. It was the only one ready to accept hungry visitors. Other restaurants would open later, in the afternoon or evening.
Without further ado, we drove off to Agios Nikolaos.
The Indonesian restaurant that we were about to visit was Lombok Red Chili—lombok means ‘chili’ in Indonesian.

After my emotional post talking about seeing the Acropolis and Parthenon from afar I thought I would now share our experience of seeing it all up close and personal.
We decided to go and visit the site on our third day in Athens and set off nice and early to make sure we had a full day to take it all in.
We walked through the city feeling excited and with the boys chatting a lot about what they were expecting to see. I understand why people use taxis and other public transport to get around cities but if you are physically able I really recommend walking. As you approach the main entrance to the hill you come through a village within the city called Plaka. It’s one of the oldest parts of the city and is full of quaint winding roads filled with cafés, restaurants, tourist shops and jewellery stores. You’ll pay more for food and goods here as they are hoping to entice the excited overseas visitors but if you go just for the atmosphere and hold back from getting the credit card out it’s really charming.
We made our way through the maze of small streets and approached the top of the hill. Before you get to the main entrance, over to your right you will see a rocky outpost jutting up in front of you. This is called Areopagus Hill (or Mars Hill) and if you like your Christian history this is the hill where the Apostle Paul delivered his famous “sermon in the mount”.
There are some steps up to the top and it’s really worth taking 5 minutes to head up and take in the views. You can see Plaka beneath you stretching out to the city beyond and behind you is the Parthenon, sitting grandly at the top of the hill. This is where you get your first full view of the size and magnificence of the place.
After we’d had our fill of this view we made our way over to the ticket office. We’d read that in the summer it can get really busy but on this warm December day just before Christmas it was fairly quiet and we didn’t have to queue at all. There were quite a few tour guides eager for us to use their services but we’d decided to go at our own pace and so politely, but increasingly firmly, said no thank you.
In the winter season you pay €10 for adult tickets with children getting in for free (the adult price is doubled through the summer). Your ticket gives you access to the whole site which is massive so well worth the money we thought.
We entered through the ticket barriers and tried to get our bearings a little. There’s a hill straight in front of you that takes you up to the Parthenon itself and then pathways leading away to your left and right, we took the right hand path and started to wander along.
One of the first things we saw was The Odeon of Herodes Atticus. This is a fairly “modern” part of the site because although the original theatre was built in 161 CE, over the years it was left to ruin before being rebuilt in the 1950’s and it is still used for drama and musical productions throughout the year. The seating area is solid marble and really impressive. You can also see this structure from the road behind the Parthenon site and it’s worth taking a wander at some point while in Athens to see both angles.
Carrying on past the Odeon there are collections of pillars, engraved stones and other treasures that have been excavated from the site over time. A very serious security guard is on hand to be sure no one is touching but you can go right up the stones, getting really close and trying to make out the faded drawings and writing which we thought was great.
A little further along is the Theatre of Dionysus. Much older than it’s Odeon counterpart and would have been used to showcase the first Greek tragedies in the 6th Century BCE. Dionysus was god of many things including wine making, festivity and theatre and we thought he sounded a fun god to have around.
We then wandered around the rest of the gardens on that side of the hill, you can see more artifacts dotted about and there are plenty of information signs in both Greek and English that fill in any of the gaps in knowledge that you might have. On the south side of the hill, high up from ground level is the entrance to The Forgotten Monument of Thrysallus. An ancient entrance to a temple that is now sadly too damaged to enter safely. The doorway, with it’s white columns, stark against the surrounding rock looks really enticing and I hope that they are able to restore and reopen this impressive monument one day.
Having seen all there was to see at ground level we now began to make our way up the uneven paths towards the Parthenon itself.
If you are ever here you must make sure you enter through the Propylaea, this is the original entrance where Athenians through the ages would have entered to seek knowledge or help or to pray and it’s really a grand sight. We took some time to sit on the steps, drinking in the atmosphere. It was a little busy but not overwhelming and everyone was mindful and respected other’s personal space. Other than signs asking you to please not touch the marble, it’s all open and again you can get really close to the pillars and stonework that make up the walk way to the top of the Acropolis.
Once at the top of the stairs the floor levels off, there is always work being done on the site and they have apparently spent a long time in recent years improving access. So although the pathways around the temples are rocky and uneven there is a smooth path right through the middle making it much more accessible to those with mobility issues.
There is so much to see once at the top, the highlight of course being the Parthenon itself, the largest structure and centrepiece of the site (this is the one you see on posters, postcards and websites — the one you can see from all around the city). Plenty of scaffolding around the temple does not detract from it’s size and grandeur. Take some time to study the pillars, looking at the hand carved detail is astonishing. We did at least two laps of the building before moving on.
My favourite thing to see was the temple of Athena — with it’s reproduction statues of the goddess around the front (you can see the originals in the Acropolis museum), it’s really a site worth seeing. If you can manage some steps and uneven ground go around the back to see the enormous entrance door to get a perspective of what it would have been like for members of the public coming to pray and offer gifts to the goddess.
The last thing I’ll point out as a “must do” up here is to go to the far end of the site and up a few steps to the Acropolis View point. This looks back over the Parthenon and other temples giving you a wonderful vantage point (and if you are feeling brave you can also peer over the top at the sheer drop down the side of the Acropolis back to street level! Warning this is not an activity for those, like my dear husband, who are worried about heights).
There are of course many other sites to see, smaller temples like Athena Nike (which was painstakingly taken apart, renovated and then put back together again in the late 1990's), as well as other areas of restoration. If you go with children see if they can spot the metal tracks that circle the site which are used to move the huge stones and marble structures as work is carried out.
After we had had our fill of Greek history we slowly made our way back down through the grand entrance and back down the hill. It takes some time, partly because it’s all quite uneven and a little slippery but partly because you just can’t stop looking at the architecture and small treasures to be found around each new corner.
We left the site through the smaller entrance on the South side, along the pedestrianised walkway of Dionysiou Areopagitou. I understand that this entrance is mostly used for tour groups and school visits but in the summer can be less busy than the main entrance for individuals needing to buy tickets.
The entrance to the Acropolis Museum is also along this walkway, we did the museum visit on a different day but if you are only in Athens for a short time it would definitely make sense to do both in the same day as they are so close. I would really recommend seeing the Acropolis first as it was fabulous to see the friezes, statues and pillars in the museum and be able to picture where you would have seen them up on the hill.
Like so many people seeing the Parthenon and spending time on the Acropolis was one of the big reasons for our visit to this city and it did not disappoint. Here are some final tips that I think would make your visit go smoothly:
* Wear good comfy, study shoes. They are making big improvements to accessibility on the site but there are lots of uneven pathways, steps and slippery surfaces so open toed sandals would not be a great choice of footwear.
* Bring plenty of water. It was a warm day when we went and with the amount of walking we did we needed plenty of hydration, I imagine it can get quite uncomfortable in the summer months.
* Read up about some the Greek gods before you go, in particular Athena, Psoiedon, Zeus and Dionysus. It was really great to bring those names to life as we saw the temples and read the information signs.
* If you are going to visit more than one or two archaeological sites you can buy combination tickets which can end up saving you money.
*Decide beforehand if you would like to use a guide while you are there so you can be confident in saying yes or no to the people who approach you at the ticket entrances.
Comment below if you’ve found this useful or if you’ve been yourself and would add any other tips :-)

It’s currently day 5, and I should say first off that it’s pretty hard to get started on writing right now. That’s not because I’m exhausted from all the cycling and heat and general intensity (although I very much am). Rather, it’s the opposite. It’s because I’m laid back in the perfect deckchair, reclined at the perfect angle, looking out at the perfect view from my perfect rest-day holiday home which I snagged for the perfect — and perfectly ridiculous — price of £33 a night.
But it hasn’t all been this sweet. Far from it.
Let’s rewind a bit.
Athens was good to me, all things considered. This is a blog about bike touring so I won’t go into too much detail regarding my holiday affairs, but a few choice notes before we continue:
Verdict: I thoroughly recommend Athens as a city to visit. Don’t hesitate if you get the chance.
Anyway, let’s get this bike tour started!
I’d been waiting for the bike tour anxiety to arrive for months, and it was only on the morning of leaving that it hit me. But I don’t think it was the tour as a whole I was afraid of; it was simply getting out of Athens. I’ve been to cities with worse traffic, but I’ve also been to cities with much better.
I tried to make the most of the €4 all-you-can-eat breakfast, shovelling spoonfuls of oats into my mouth, but the nerves weren’t allowing my stomach to settle. I did my best to force it all down, figuring that I’d just throw some of it up if need be. My body would work it out.
I’d reassembled my bike the previous day and had all my bags packed, so I’m not quite sure how it took me a further hour to get going, but that’s what happened. Eventually I was ready, and, after some rejigging of the panniers (does one ever just jig?), I was on my wobbly wobbly way out of the hostel and into the streets of Athens. I had begun!
And then, not 10 seconds later, I stopped. Brake calibration issues would in fact plague me for the next hour or so, but eventually I got those suckers under control and started to build some momentum. As for the streets of Athens, they were remarkably easy to navigate (Komoot certainly helped). There were plenty of bike lanes, pink and quiet and well-paved, and within just a few minutes of finding them all my fears of getting squashed by a passing fruit cart were put to rest.
The bike lanes eventually ended and I had no choice but to take to the roads, but these weren’t too much trouble. There was one hill which to this day remains the steepest hill I’ve climbed — we’re talking cheese-rolling levels here — but after I’d tidied my lungs back into my chest, the rest of Athens was plain sailing.
Talking of sailing, next up was the Port of Piraeus, where I’d been told I could board a ferry to Salamina, a necessary stepping stone on the way out of Greece. I asked around and was told a boat would come ‘soon’. Four people gave me the same answer. I waited for the boat. And waited. And waited. Was ‘soon’ actually the Greek word for ‘you’re in the wrong place, my friend’?
It might well have been. Eventually, the fifth person I asked told me that I was indeed at the wrong port and that I’d need to get to Perama. Alrighty then. Another 10km of riding, this stretch significantly less enjoyable as I shared main roads with speeding cars, and I was finally at the right port just as the ferry was about to leave. I rolled the bike onto the ferry and gave myself a pat on the back for making it through the streets of Athens.
Riding in Salamina was great, my first experience of the treats to come. An appetiser, if you will. Lightly undulating hills carried me past glittering waters under a clear blue sky, and there was a pretty horse somewhere too. It wasn’t long before I had to stop for my first photoshoot — the first of many, I’m not ashamed to say.
After an hour or so, I reached the next ferry that would take me back to the mainland. Rolling my bike onto the ferry, a man in overalls began yelling at me:
‘Look at the cones, look at the cones, what do they mean!?’
Smiling dumbly, I told him I didn’t know what the cones meant, but, goodness me, there’s a strong smell of paint in here, isn’t there?
It turned out I had rolled my bike straight over his freshly painted deck. Whoopsie. The paint wasn’t wet enough to cling to my tyres — a shame, cornflower blue wheels would have been quite fetching — but he gave me an earful nonetheless. I made my silly-tourist apologies and parked up my bike, breathing in the good if slightly painty sea air as we made the crossing.
Back on the mainland, I experienced some hillier sections for the next hour or so. My legs hadn’t yet adjusted to the work required and I found this pretty tough going. However, it was made much easier by the scenery I was passing through: looming dusty-orange cliff faces to the right, sparkling ocean to the left. And also by the driver who gave me the rocker sign as he passed me in his van. Thank you, stranger.
Away from the coast, I had my first encounter with aggressive dogs. This was to become a frequent occurrence. You hear the barks first of all, not quite sure which direction they’re coming from, and then suddenly there’s a four-legged creature all slobber and fury rushing towards you. I’ve become a little more used to it by now, but it still jars, and the first time was a pretty hairy experience.
At one point, the dogs wouldn’t stop chasing me and I was worried about them getting caught in the wheels, so I stopped, put the bike between myself and the dogs, and in my best angry-dad voice, commanded ‘STOP, BAD DOG, GO HOME’. And did they listen? Reader, they did not. They just snarled and barked and bared their impressive canines.
But, next time, I’d be ready for them. Oh, I’d be ready for them. I’d slipped my ultrasonic dog repeller into my pocket for easy access and, at the first sound of barking, I wielded my wand like Ron Weasley at a pack of fluffy dementors.
Be gone, vile beasts! I might or might not have yelled.
And, astonishingly, it worked! At least kind of. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting anything at all from this unassuming bit of plastic, and it’s true that the device didn’t stop them from chasing me all together. But once I clicked that magic button, they seemed to fall back to a safer distance. And oh, the power I felt… This Ron might just become his own Voldemort.
As the day was drawing to a close and my energy reserves were being depleted, I stopped off for the perfect refuel: a pita filled with chips and gyros. This I shared with a much nicer chap than the ones who had come before. Maybe it was the food, but this dog was just an absolute pal. Perhaps I should be wielding chicken gyros at my attackers rather than a plastic stick in future.
I finally reached my campsite in Ancient Corinth at around 7.30pm. I didn’t want to wild camp, deciding that it would be best for the first night to be somewhere I felt safe and could get a decent night’s rest.
The former worked out well; the latter, not so much. Dogs barked from all sides deep into the night and, as I had left my earplugs in my panniers and was tucked up (un)comfortably in my tent, I couldn’t bring myself to go outside and get them. Eventually, at around 1.30am and with the chorus of howls still in full swing, I succumbed and dragged myself out of the tent.
It was a smart move. There is a singular pleasure to wandering out of your tent in the dead of night — the stars, the moon, the exquisite isolation. As I stood there craning my neck up at the sky, feeling impossibly small and yet entirely undiminished, I felt a deep sense of good will from the universe. The trip had begun, and everything was going to be okay.

Welcome to Athens, Mississippi. Athens is an unincorporated community just a few minutes outside of the small town that I reside in. But, somehow, I had never explored it.
I assembled a dream team of myself, Davis Helton, and Luke Johnson (Davis would kill me if he didn’t have a shout-out), and we decided to delve deep into this lost community to visit the long-fabled Athens Jail.
Built in 1830, the jail is somewhat mysterious, with stories of ghosts running abound in my community. According to the fine folks at the Monroe County Historical Society (this society is truly top notch, keeping records and finding stories of a small community with little publicity), Joshua Toomer created the current structure of the jail in 1845. Later that night, Toomer drunkenly hopped on the wrong horse and was accused of being a horse thief. This accusation landed him the luxury of being the first person to stay a night in this newly founded jail.
It is no surprise that ghostly rumors would be abundant for a building of this nature. This is where things get a little murky, as the jail kept no records as to who exactly died there and how.

Kelly May Sheehan — UX Researcher, Designer, and Developer
Zoë Phalen — UX Researcher, Designer, and Developer
During my Emerging Media Master’s program, I developed a capstone project in place of a thesis. I partnered with my peer, Zoë Phalen, to create Athens Era.
The final task on the capstone journey requires individuals and teams to present their project at the event, Emerge. This event invites students, faculty, alumni, and guests to celebrate the completion of the degree and each capstone project. Each team takes the spotlight and provides an overview of their completed work.
I created an e-ccomerce marketplace website for local artists of Athens, GA along with my partner for our capstone project, called Athens Era. I worked on developing the website, while producing supporting materials. All materials and deliverables may be accessed on our project website, here.
We developed our capstone project in separate stages, and documented our progress with youtube videos. Our full capstone journey can be viewed on our youtube playlist, here.
At the beginning of this course, we already produced our capstone website in its alpha stage. We started with developing our website in its beta stage, with guidance from the results of our user research and testing.
We had identified the website’s issues, but finding the solution for each was our challenge.
With each stage of development, we focused on separate issues we identified during our research:
One of our biggest leaps in development, was when we created additional graphics to match our brand and help tell the story of what Athens Era is. They really helped show how Athens Era is a credible platform for artists and assisting in storytelling throughout the website. Here are a few graphics:
Beyond the development of our capstone website, we created a poster to promote our final project. With this poster, we aimed to clearly communicate what Athens Era is and attract people to the website. This would help solve the issue of: “weak recognition of website for only Athens, GA artists” before people first visit the website.
Of course, we also addressed the weak recognition of the website for only Athens artists by changing our information architecture and wording for more clarity.
Along with the poster, we also created a trailer for the promotion of Athens Era. We began with a storyboard of our original idea for the production of the trailer.
Later, we iterated our storyboard to reflect our final trailer, which may be viewed here.
We used Canva to produce our trailer after trying out different videos platforms. Due to our lack of video production equipment, we opted to use Canva for its digital animations and resources for a fully digitally designed trailer, as opposed to using raw footage we could have filmed form our phones.
After we uploaded all of our deliverables to our project website and concluded our development on Athens Era, we presented our results at the New Media Institute’s end of year event, Emerge.
Our Emerge presentation summarizes our capstone journey and demos our functioning website and its notable features.
We spoke about the inspiration of the project, along with our ideation methods, research, and development.
The Athens Era Emerge Presentation may be viewed here.
Throughout this course, I learned how to effectively communicate with an audience through digital and physical products. I am pleased with the completion of our capstone project and how much I have developed my storytelling skills.

Last week I attended the NT Live broadcast of Nicholas Hytner’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at The Bridge Theatre and it is an experience which I will never forget. Just as Peter Brook’s seminal RSC production struck a chord in the 1970s with its minimalist staging and darker, adult take on Shakespeare’s comedy, so I expect director Hytner’s immersive, pop culture savvy production to become one which defines future Dreams for decades to come.
Despite the largely carnivalesque tenor of this production (which felt as palpable in the cinema as in the theatre), the production opened on an unexpectedly sombre note. A procession of black clad men and women entered the stage singing in plain chant, thus conjuring a funereal mood as opposed the ‘nuptial hour’ promised in Theseus’s (Oliver Chris) opening line.
The costumes of the female characters, the audience had been told in the opening commentary before the production began, were supposedly evocative of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, which has found renewed cultural currency in recent years due to a successful television adaptation and its resonance with contemporary feminist movements such as #MeToo.
This was underlined by the production’s first (of many) spectacular effects as Hippolyta (Gwendoline Christie) was transported onstage, trapped inside a sleek glass cage which reminded the audience of her status as a captive queen, a fact over which so many productions choose to elide. Gemma wrote about this aspect of the production in detail in her article earlier this week, offering a deeper dive into that image and its connections to Christie’s role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones.
Not only is Hippolyta a prisoner to a conquering duke but Hermia (Isis Hainsworth) is also greatly mistreated in this opening scene as it is assumed that she is the property of both her father and intended husband, despite her protestations that she wishes to marry another man of her choosing. The decision to draw out these more insidious themes from one of Shakespeare’s most beloved comedies by connecting them to memorable feminist imagery in popular culture was therefore highly astute.
One of the key feature’s of this production were the modern linguistic additions to Shakespeare’s text which, although initially jarring in the serious opening scenes at court, felt incredibly natural once delivered by the Rude Mechanicals in their first appearance onstage. The Bridge Theatre’s immersive pit also allowed actors to use the audience in inventive and involving ways, such as when the Mechanicals wish to consult a ‘calendar’ in Act 3 Scene 1 to know whether the moon will shine during their performance.
Given the ‘extra-textual’ additions to Shakespeare’s text already established early on in the production, it therefore made perfect sense for the cast to break out into the audience and decide to consult the Calendar app in an audience member’s phone. This not only updated the scene to incorporate the changing sense of what the word ‘calendar’ means but gave way to hilarious unspoken remonstrations when the Mechanicals became side-tracked by looking through said phone at images which we can only assume were illicit. The extract from the broadcast below features this moment in all its glory.
Hammed Animashaun’s extraordinary Bottom shone particularly brightly during these anachronistic moments. His naturalistic delivery and a wide comedic range encompassed everything from deadpan moments able to draw laughs by the merest eyebrow raise to the best version of Pyramus’s ludicrously overlong and overblown suicide which I’ve ever witnessed.
However, it would be remiss not to mention Felicity Montagu’s understated Quince, who provided the perfect foil for her shrieking, scene-stealing counterpart. There was a perfectly acute balance between tension and affection at the heart of their relationship. Despite Bottom’s leading thespian/backseat director pushing against the rules imposed by Quince’s put-upon actor-manager, it was nevertheless clear that they were pulling in the same direction and this ensured that those scenes were some of the production’s best.
In a further attempt to redress the gender imbalance and biases of Shakespeare’s play, Hytner chose to swap many of the lines delivered by Oberon (Oliver) and Titania (Christie). It is this decision, perhaps, that served the production most effectively. Now with the lion’s share of the lines, Christie was a truly powerful Titania, displaying brilliant armography (thanks Strictly) and radiating majestical power which will be familiar to anyone who has seen her steal each Game of Thrones scene in which she features.
The reversal of Fairy King and Queen was particularly effective in the inclusion of a subtle twist at the play’s end that — thanks to Oliver and Christie playing both the magical and mortal monarchs — Hippolyta may have secretly conjured the fairy kingdom to terrorise her husband-to-be. Hytner chose to keep this ambiguous but it was an inspired suggestion and made sense of the decision to have the same two actors play these roles.
Christie was ably supported by a nimble, creepy, day-glo Puck, played by David Moorst who delivered a brilliantly original iteration of the beloved fairy: think Lee Evans meets Willem Dafoe. Moorst not only displayed a spectacular array of acrobatics but oscillated between mischievous contempt for the lovers he poisoned and genuine pathos once he realised the extent to which they had suffered. Like Animashaun, his delivery of the extra-textual additions felt incredibly natural, whilst the blurring of the fairy and courtly world were sinisterly underscored by his additional role as a quietly malevolent Philostrate.
An example of the production’s attention to detail and its capacity to elevate oft-forgotten moments in this oft-performed play was Philostrate’s address to the three couples prior to the Rude Mechanicals’ performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Prior to Theseus selecting their play, an array of other options are delivered by Philostrate and, rather than skate over these in the audience’s anticipation of Dream’s grand comedic climax, Hytner instead chose to have actors (who had already featured as fairies) appear onstage to represent those alternatives.
These ranged from a group of women grotesquely entangled in red balloons to a vaudevillian entertainer creating a paper chain of people, all of which was in service of an inspired final gag. Theseus’s decision was framed as a reality television-esque winner reveal, underscored by ever-diminishing lights and the dramatic music which erupted once the Mechanicals had been selected. Their adorable purple jumpers (which read ‘Rude Mechanicals’ on the back) underscored their position as amateurs amidst professionals. Truly, Athens Got Talent.
In my next article, I’ll focus in greater detail on these references to modern culture and, in particular, the popular music which featured throughout this dream of a show.

As a writer, I’m a sucker for literary themed restaurants, especially those I stumble upon, which is exactly how I found the Little Kook in Athens. The restaurant changes themes seasonally and I was lucky enough to enjoy the Alice in Wonderland ambiance.
Surrounded by the chaos of Athens’ life, adults and children alike visibly exhaled when they entered the alleyway with tables lined under an archway of decorations. The vibrant colors, familiar characters, and smell of desserts in the air seemed to bring out the silliness in the patrons: laughter, photos, one older woman giving herself cat ears as she posed next to Alice.
The staff was dressed in full themed outfits. I first requested a menu from Alice, then the Mad Hatter, and only after asking the Mad Hatter a third time did I receive one. It crossed my mind that perhaps I misunderstood (I am navigating Greece as a non-Greek speaker) and this was one of those “purposely rude” establishments. Don’t worry, it’s not one of those restaurants.
Before I could order, a coffee drink was brought to my table. Sadly, it belonged to the man at the next table. I’m not sure if he ever received his. The server generously told me to keep what they brought and did not charge me for the drink.
After reviewing the English menu, I narrowed it down to ordering Granny’s Hair, The…

By Megan Sheekey
This week Mayor Giorgos Kaminis announced the creation of the Athens Partnership, a nonprofit vehicle established with guidance from Bloomberg Associates. The mission of the Athens Partnership is to facilitate public-private partnerships, supporting priority public programs in Athens, Greece. This uniquely positioned entity will intersect between city government and the private sector, leveraging the resources and strengths of both. It will allow the city, with philanthropic support, to address pressing needs and pilot new programs while evaluating their outcomes and merit for future investment.
As the migrant crisis and economic instability in Greece continue to deeply affect Athens residents, the Partnership will be one tool to help the city remain responsive and moving forward. Bloomberg Associates is honored to count Athens among its client cities.
Op-ed by Athens Mayor George Kaminis in the newspaper “Kathimerini Tis Kiriakis”
ATHENS PARTNERSHIP
A Mayor who wishes to do his job properly in today’s Greece must always find a balance among four basic priorities. Firstly, he must ensure the daily operation of his city. Secondly, he must respond to the social needs constantly generated by the current economic crisis (soup kitchens, homeless shelters, distribution of primary need goods, social tutoring classes, etc.). Thirdly, he must react fast to the, special or by now usual, political uproars we have been experiencing in recent years (political violence, long term strikes, occupation of public buildings, extended delinquency etc.). Fourthly, in several cities, as for example Athens, the mayor is now required to deal also with the multiple consequences of the refugee/immigration issue threatening to deconstruct an entire society, the strengths of which are tested and have reached their limit in the last six years.
One would say that all of this constitutes a multifaceted reality, which every mayor acting under similar conditions is compelled to deal with. In some way, this chronic and multifaceted crisis that our country is going through has formulated a “normality” of its own, an explosive mixture of daily life and special circumstances, where the latter are clearly dominating, since daily life in our days obeys to no normal routine. The drastic reduction in resources, both in manpower and materials, along with a number of other factors have made extremely and unimaginably difficult the effort of a mayor to even accomplish elementary duties such as, e.g., sanitation.
It is not enough though to just keep our head above water. We must also have our eyes focused deep in the horizon. Our cities, especially the major ones, and Athens mainly, have eventually taken over the duty to prepare the country for the post-crisis times. What the central government has failed to realize for several years now is that there are actually municipalities that are innovative. This is what we’ve been doing for so long in Athens.
At the same time that we are dealing with the problems of today being absolutely focused on our job, we are also obligated to prepare for tomorrow, raising the bar to the height it should be as if everything around us was going well. We are constantly seeking new modes of action, with a stable outward orientation, in Greece as well as abroad. In Athens especially we have broadened the range of collaboration of the City, forming partnerships with all of the reliable agencies of the city: businesses, public organizations, professional and commercial chambers, universities, private sponsors and, certainly the active citizens of the Society of Citizens.
Today we are taking a step further. We created the Partnership for Athens or Athens Partnership, a non-profit organization promoting targeted synergies of the municipality with the private sector.
With the Athens Partnership we support infrastructure projects, but also initiatives to reinforce the social cohesion and economic development and by and large the improvement of the quality of life in the city. The Partnership is seeking to attract donations from foundations, businesses and private sponsors, among which of course are the Greeks Abroad. The organization and operation of the Partnership shall obey the most updated principles of accountability, transparency and effectiveness, with emphasis on the funding of innovative and pilot programs, which shall not only benefit the city but also the municipality through the transfer of modern know how. As an independent organization operating between the municipality of Athens and the private sector, the Athens Partnership combines the forces of both, with the final beneficiary being the resident of our city.
The Athens Partnership is following the tradition of successful prototypes that have been operating efficiently for several years in major cities abroad such as London, New York, Los Angeles, and Melbourne; they also have non-profit organizations cooperating creatively with the municipalities in vitally important sectors, like fighting poverty, dealing with crises and sustainable development.
The municipal authority of our city and myself, personally would like to extent our heartfelt thanks to all the private citizens and organizations in Greece and abroad that have supported at times the capital with donations and sponsorships. With the Athens Partnership we are capitalizing on the experience we have acquired and upgrading the quality of our cooperation with all those who are intended to help us in this difficult task that we have undertaken: to keep our city standing and methodically prepare it for the future.

I came with low expectations — a stopover, a few days at most. “It’s kind of chaotic,” a friend warned me. “Not like the islands.” But I landed, blinked into the bright Athenian sun, and something in me clicked.
It started with the coffee. Greeks take their coffee seriously, and I learned quickly that sipping a freddo espresso at a slow pace is practically a lifestyle here. I sat at a small café in Koukaki and watched the city swirl around me: scooters zipping past, old men arguing over backgammon, the Acropolis peeking out in the distance like it was eavesdropping on our conversations.
Athens has this joyful contradiction to it — ancient and alive. In one direction, you walk past ruins that have witnessed centuries. In the other, a street artist is painting a neon mural on a crumbling wall. It’s not a museum — it’s a mosaic. And somehow, it works.
I wandered through Plaka, where balconies overflowed with bougainvillea and cats napped in the sun like tiny emperors. I bought fresh koulouri from a street vendor for 50 cents and felt like I’d hacked happiness.
Then came the music. At sunset, I stumbled upon a group of musicians playing traditional Greek songs near Anafiotika. Strangers danced. Kids laughed. Someone handed me a drink and said “Kalosorises” — Welcome. I smiled so wide my cheeks hurt.
I kept walking. The golden hour in Athens is no joke. It bathes the entire city in honey — softening even the graffiti and concrete into something cinematic. I climbed Filopappou Hill and looked back at the Parthenon as the lights flicked on. It felt like the city was winking at me.
And just like that, I was in love.
Not with some idealized version of Athens, but with the real one. The imperfect, passionate, noisy, sun-soaked Athens that feeds you too much and talks too loud and insists you stay just a little longer.
By the end of the afternoon, I stopped being a tourist. I was a guest. Maybe even something more.
Athens didn’t just surprise me — it lifted me. Reminded me that joy doesn’t have to be loud to be deep. That sometimes, happiness is a glass of cold white wine on a rooftop with strangers who feel like old friends, and a city that feels like home — even if it isn’t yours.

Note to Readers:
These reflections are simply my personal observations and interpretations, based on my experiences in Athens. I understand that myths, religions, and cultures are deeply subjective and complex. While the stories and comparisons might resonate differently with others, I hope to offer a glimpse into how I viewed these intersections from my own perspective. At the end of the day, we all bring our unique lenses to the world, and it is through these diverse viewpoints that we learn from each other.
The story of the city of Athens being named so starts with a scene of a duel between Athena and Poseidon. A king sought a patron deity for the city who would protect it from attacks and bless its citizens. Both gods were interested.
The venue for the duel was decided to be at the top of a hill where Acropolis stands today. Poseidon struck his trident on the ground and out came gushing water. People ran to have a sip of what they thought was holy. It turned out to be saline, reinforcing Poseidon’s dominion over the Sea. Then Athena struck her staff and there emerged a beautiful olive tree. Olive proved invaluable to the greeks: Its wood were used to make boats that helped them trade, fruits made pickles, seed pressed for oil. Therefore, Athena was chosen as the patron deity. [1]
However, this enraged Poseidon who cursed the city with floods. To calm him, Athenians built a temple for Poseidon at Cape Sounion, overlooking the sea, his kingdom.
The Greek gods, I realised, seemed to differ from Hindu gods in how they were influenced by emotions and expressed unpredictability in actions, which many might term as impulsive and unjust. This caused a lot of dissonance to me because of the striking contrast to Hindu deities or gods I’ve grown up around, who although express emotions, but never allow these to cloud their judgment or be unrighteous. (There are exceptions ofc, but statistically insignificant and associated with taboo). Over the course of the trip, in a conversation with my guides, I reached the conclusion that Greek gods reflect psychological archetypes, while the Hindu gods represented ethical ideals. It seems like a classic case of Prescriptive vs Cautionary approaches. I will explain this with an example later.
Meanwhile, let's take a short detour to understand present circumstances in Greece.
I arrived in Greece at night, and the first sights that greeted me were far from the postcard-perfect images of Santorini and Mykonos areas. My stay was in a residential area of Omania, away from the curated tourist experience, and I was taken aback by the sheer poverty, homelessness and drug abuse, that lined the streets.
Greece’s economic crisis played a large role in this. After joining the EU, the government underreported its actual debt, making the economy seem more stable than it was. When the truth surfaced, investor confidence collapsed, and the country fell to debt crisis.
Because Greece uses the euro, it couldn’t devalue its currency to make exports more competitive, closing gates to making an economic comeback. People lost jobs, rural population migrated to Athens, to the point that today almost one-third of Greece lives in Athens alone. This led to a strain on urban amenities. The symptoms were very visible to me. I saw open defecation, men and women fighting and desperate looks from beggars scanning passerbys.
It busted the myth which the British perpetuated in colonized India that white man is superior by nature because he is inherently civilized. [2] Turns out, stripped of prosperity, social stability decays everywhere. That social stability and ‘in-group members trust’ is more a function of economic security than a function of race, was an assuring observation.[3]
Although the situation is too complex to be done justice in a paragraph, it can be said that misplaced intention to generate political good-will coupled with several other factors instead of investing in avenues which would ensure multiplier effect in the economy, Greece fell deeper into the debt trap. (I believe we would help ourselves by applying this lesson to the worsening situation with Freebies in India.)
While Greece faces serious economic struggles, I was moved by the resilience and warmth of the Greek people despite their hardships. They were nice and straightforward, even weary of their circumstances. Tourism keeps their economy afloat but I could sense their quiet frustration with tourists. And although you can’t quiet bite the hands that feed you, you are free to resent the fact that you have to rely on it.
Anyways, back to our cultural discussion. The next day started with a tour of Acropolis. It is at the center of the city, both geographically and historically. The Greek civilisation was a cluster of city-states, each with their own Patron Deity. However, they all worshipped a shared pantheon of 12 Olympian gods.[4]
The Acropolis itself houses three key temples, each dedicated to different aspects of Athena. The Parthenon, the grandest, is dedicated to Athena Parthenos (the Virgin Goddess). The Erechtheion is tied to the myth of Athena’s contest with Poseidon, and the Temple of Athena Nike honors her as the goddess of victory. [5]
Built fully out of marble, the columns of The Parthenon stand huge, with the doors facing the east. This was done intentionally to have the sun’s first ray in the morning fall upon Athena’s idol, which was around 12 meters tall and was said to have been built out of Gold and Ivory. Must have been a beautiful sight to behold!
However, there is no idol there anymore. It was destroyed in the later years as Hellenism fell and the temple became a church first and a mosque later. What stands today is just a few columns, although the government is now working to reconstruct the temple, asserting its central role in the Greek tourism and economy.
In fact a culture-preservation law prohibits any building in athens to be taller than 103 meters, ensuring that the Acropolis must be visible from all corners of the city and should be the highest point.[6]
The funny thing however is that right next to the hill of Acropolis, I saw Mount Lycabettus, with a Greek Orthodox chapel at the top, exactly twice the height of Acropolis. Orthodox Christianity is the state religion of Greece and I couldn’t help but wonder if the placement of this chapel — literally twice higher than the sacred Acropolis — was a subtle statement of the new religious order.
Hellenism survives today in form of modern reconstructions of rituals from textual sources and around 2000 people follow the religion in private. [7] . Private, I emphasise, because the Hellenics have had a tough time recently opening a temple because the temple supervisor was jailed on inauguration day and the church released an official statement, urging the adherents of the true faith “not to be led astray”.[8] The funniest thing, the Right to practice religion is an inviolable right in the Greek constitution and it was essentially ensured to the adherents of hellenic religion after its official recognition in 2017.[9] Critics have cited the lack of proper official procedures and other troublesome aspects underlining the reason behind closure of the temple but I am of the firm belief that this is outside the scope of our discussion and is purely concern of the involved parties. We have no right to impose our POV over theirs, since the stakes differ.
Hellenism died a slow brutal death. I call it brutal because unlike the forces that actively engage in demeaning pagan practices today, did not even find Hellenism worthy of being opposed in the Roman ages. The Romans in-fact absorbed the greek pantheon, often reshaping characters and stories. The real blow came with the Fall of Rome to Christianity where Hellenism was actively suppressed (Theodosian Decrees which outlawed pagan practices).
Greek gods derive their stories from texts like The Odyssey and The Iliad and these stories (to say the least), though fascinating, feel scandalous to the modern mind. Like the story of Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and fire, who was physically deformed and married to Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite had an extramarital affair with Ares, the god of war. This angered Hephaestus who created a magical web to trap Ares and Aphrodite in the “act” in order to shame them in front of public. They were trapped and Hephaestus called the gods to witness the blatant unrighteousness. The gods simply laughed at all of them and let it slide. No one was punished. No consequence whatsoever.[10]
When such stories and their morality were challenged by the Greek philosophers, the priestly class did not seem equipped to handle the questions. In fact, instead of reasoning or applying intellectual capacity, some even tried to silence the dissent. Philosophers like Socrates, who offered alternate theories of Godhood, were thrown in prison on charges of “corrupting the youth” (shown in picture).[11] This is in severe contrast to the brahmanical approach where the response was to strengthen arguments and rationalize actions, codifying them even, which is probably the reason why Hinduism survives today. The natural response of the Vedic society to Buddhist rise was the systematic Refutation of Śūnyavāda (Doctrine of Emptiness) by Mīmāṃsakas led by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, which was later followed by the rise of Ādi Śaṅkarācārya who brought the Vedic teachings to their logical conclusions.
This is also be traced to the differing roles of the priestly class in a Hindu and Hellenic society. While the hellenic priests often acted as a medium between the gods and the common mass, conducting rituals, orally communcating stories and seeking blessings, the priestly class in Hindu society served multifold roles of conducting rituals, preserving texts, codifying ethics and asserting supremacy of The Vedas. Hinduism’s ability to absorb, debate, and reformulate ideas, even in the face of external challenges, is a significant strength. [12][13]
Although the Vedic Paramparā also distinguishes between Karma Kāṇḍa (ritual action) and Jñāna Kāṇḍa(knowledge), the traditional Gurukula system trained students across a wide spectrum of disciplines — ranging from astronomy and mathematics to linguistics, logic, and philosophy. This stands in striking contrast to ancient Greece, where schools of philosophy often developed independently of the priestly or ritualistic traditions, leading to a sharper divide between intellectual inquiry and religious practice.
The stories of gods were also contrasting, with common undertones of personified emotions. During an interaction with another Greek Mythology enthusiast, who quoted me this story of Aphrodite and Ares (the underlying theme being adultery and passion) , I was immediately reminded of the story of Lord Hanumān doubting his capabilities before making a leap to Lanka. It took him a trusted aide in the form of Jāmbavān to remind him of his true powers, set aside his doubts and take a leap across the seas. His story underlines the common theme of self-doubt and imposter syndrome that all of us face, whilst also providing a solution — seeking reassurance from a trusted friend or mentor.
If Greece taught me anything it is that Bharat and Bhartiyata are here to stay. Our ancestors have left us with an unshakable foundation — a profound source of strength and reassurance. Big white pill.
Yes, people might moving towards and away with time, but to quote His Holiness The Late Shankaracharya of Dwarkapeeth
“the seed will never perish. A minority shall always remain faithful to traditions…….. and that will be enough to keep it from getting lost”.
Around 2000 people in Greece still follow Hellenism. Zeus, Athena, and Dionysus are quitely worshipped in the altars of their homes. Their festivals have found a way to stay alive.
If a tradition, once our contemporary, can stay alive in shadows, how much stronger must ours be?
For over a thousand years, around 130 Agnihotri families have kept the sacred Agni alive. [14]
The Vedas are today chanted on the Ghats of Kashi, exactly like they were chanted 4000 years ago.
Indra, Varuna, and Mitra are still offered oblations.
The lineage of our Acharyas remains strong. The saints and realized beings still walk around us, in subtle and physical forms.
Our deities still respond to our prayers.
The institutions are still around to produce another Shivaji, another Vivekananda, and another Chandragupta Maurya.
People still chant the name of Shri Rama. Glory be to Him. Glory be to Maa Bharti for staying so strong even on the face of severe onslaughts. And Glory be to the Divine Mother for making me a Bhartiya first and an Indian second.
Seeing how remnants of Hellenism persist, despite centuries of suppression, made me appreciate how deeply rooted traditions find ways to survive. It reminded me of my own traditions and their resilience. Across cultures: faith, memory, and heritage endure in the hearts of people, waiting for the right moment to shine again.

If you follow Coworkies regularly, we’ve taken you to many different cities already. From New York to Shanghai or lately Prague, we’ve shared stories of people creating an impact on their cities by building incredible local coworking scenes. This month, we bring you to a whole new city, one we did talk about yet: Athens.
Why did we go to Athens? So many reasons!
Aside from discover a beautiful city full of History, we were curious to:
In just 2 days, we were lucky enough to find all the answers to our questions. To discover it too, scroll down and enjoy the ride through Athens unique coworking scene.
With 665,000 inhabitants in the city proper (3.75 Mo for the larger Athens) and more than 5 Mo tourists a year, Athens is without a doubt one of the lungs of Greece. Over the last decade, this lung has been heavily damaged by one of the toughest economical crisis of its History that has impacted many professionals and industries, from corporate companies to freelancers.
How did coworking grew in the middle of such a difficult time, let’s have look!
/ Facts and figures.
Unless other European capital cities such as Berlin or London, coworking has reached Athens later, more precisely in 2010 with the opening of CoLab workspace, which does not exist anymore. Until 2012, the entire country was counting 4 coworking spaces, which is a really low number that can also be explained and aligned with the crisis the country encountered as well as a lack of education about the term coworking itself.
Indeed, for a country of 11.3 Mo inhabitants, counting 4 coworking spaces does not help in spreading the word and educating the population to the new ways of working. But a wind of change has hit the country and today, in Athens only, there are about 10 coworking spaces that have flourished, offering various concepts to freelancers, companies and startups:
Now that the introduction is made, let’s dig deeper into Athens coworking scene, from the days it started to today!
Coworkies in Athens.
All and all, we spent 1 and half day in Athens and one thing is sure, we did not rest. We had the pleasure to visit 6 coworking spaces, in different areas of Athens. The diversity of spaces we came across was pretty impressive. Above all, what has impressed us even more is the people making Athens coworking scene what is is. Each one of them has a unique story that reflects in her/his space. In Athens, we’ve come across education in coworking spaces. We’ve also visited makerspace for Artists or Companies. Lastly, we’ve even had a yummy lunch prepared by refugees in a coworking space with a social impact.
We invite you to explore Athens with us by browsing around our interactive map of spaces we’ve seen! Some hidden tips and stories not present in this article are hidden in there, will you be able to find them?
The following piece has been co-written with coworking spaces from Athens. Thank you The Cube, Stone Soup and Athens Makerspace for contributing.
Did you know that, CoLab, which opened in 2010 and has now been transformed and renamed The Cube, was actually an idea pitched at the Startup Weekend?
“Like many we had also been directly affected by the crisis in Greece and we were bold and crazy enough to create our next job investing everything we had and didn’t have into a crazy new adventure. It’s been a real roller coaster but so worth it and rewarding.” — Maria, co-founder of The Cube.
Since CoLab, other coworking spaces have flourished in Athens.
In 2011, Loft2Work opened its doors, with the vision to build a space Encouraging & supporting Social Entrepreneurship as a means to promote social justice and alleviate poverty. Loft2Work was also very popular for organizing events centered on people rather than on businesses.
In 2012, 123p opened its doors with the objective to become THE place in town for startups. Renamed today the Found.ation, it is the leading technology and innovation enabling platform in SE Europe, acting as a startup hub, a digital transformation accelerator for corporations and a tech education hive.
Coworking has no borders and this is very true for Impact Hub Athens. After studying in Vienna and Madrid and working out of Impact Hub in both respective cities, , Dimitris Kokkinakis and Sophie Lamprou, returned to Athens and decided to create the brand there in 2013. Since then, Impact Hub Athens has had tremendous impact on the city, gathering professionals working for social good and organizing some of the most incredible project such as El Sistema Greece which promotes inclusion and integration for refugee children through music education and even had a huge concert at the Acropolis last summer.
In 2014, Olga and Klaas have opened Stone Soup. When we asked Olga what pushed them to open a coworking space, she told us, she got inspired by Amsterdam.
“The Dutch capital inspired me professionally, made me confident and showed me how to put in action my ideas. It also convinced me that the north was not my place to be. I came back to Greece with the dream to implement better the work I was doing in Amsterdam. I thought I would do it better because in Greece it mattered more and the impact would be bigger for my entourage and myself. So I started networking and bringing people together and we started sharing the same roof, working together and making plans for new projects, or in other words, I initiated Stone Soup by placing a pot with water on fire and threw in it some stones. Then it all started cooking…” — Olga, Stone Soup
The people of Stone Soup are…
“Professionals with one foot set in Greece and the other somewhere abroad. You cannot afford to be based only in Greece nor to depend your sales only in the local market. I think the people that surround us are motivated and adventurous with great stories to share and they can surely inspire you. They like the warm and casual vibe at Stone Soup. The ability to easily interact with other co-workers and the feeling of ownership at the space. We started as a cooperative space, and while we maintain our coop ideals, we have matured as a business and we offer our services in a more structured way. But we remain open. Whomever would like to join, they are welcome. We do not ask for a membership fee in order to share our network or knowledge and we try to operate with no strings attached. “
What if an old cosmetic factory could transform into a beautiful and modular coworking space? This is exactly what happened in 2016, when Th. Tsiropoulos and V. Stavropoulos opened the beautiful Tzaferi16. The modern and contemporary look of the space makes it a great place not only for work but also for events.
But Athens is not just about coworking spaces. The makers scene is also growing and flourishing, We visited Athens Makerspace, a young non profit organisation, founded in March 2016. When Ilias and his team started it, their vision was clear:
“Every person, of every age, must have access to the tools and knowledge they need to implement their ideas. We associate ourselves with the ideas of sustainable design, innovation and fabrication.”
What do people work on at Athens Makerspace? Well, pretty much anything it seems:
“Our members work on a variety of projects. We have amateurs, intermediate makers and professionals. So many amazing creations are taking place in our makerspace. Members who use the laser cutter to create jewelry, handbags, signs and more to sell. Members using the woodshop and electronics lab to create a full size arcade. Members who use the 3D printers and the electronics lab to create custom automations and robots. A member who uses the sewing machine to create reusable tea bags and much more. We are even developing production methods to upcycle plastic waste. Our members can use our equipment for practical, professional or artistic reasons. They are encouraged to innovate, prototype solutions meet other makers, learn and share their knowledge. There are so many possibilities. The sky is the limit!”
The opening of Athen Makerspace has inspired others. LUDD a lab for Open Design and Fabrication opened its doors in 2017. More than just a space, LUDD is a platform where the latest developments in open design, prototyping and fabrication technology, along with shared know-how, serve as the basis for a community of individuals, organizations and broader initiatives, to connect and collaborate, thus accelerating local innovation. We had the pleasure to visit Manolis, one of the co-founder and his team and were really impressed by the amount of cool projects that are built in the space. From furniture to more complex pieces, creativity has no boundaries at LUDD.
Today, Athens coworking and maker scenes have reached a new milestone. With more than 10 coworking spaces around the city and more coming, the population becomes more and more familiar with the concept of coworking and its benefits.
Chatting with our contributors, they gave us very different perspective on it:
“But I think lately it has evolved to a more self-sustained business and the market is growing. I think people are more cautious about making claims as to how much the startup hype is able to support the co-working business and the overall economy.” — Olga, Stone Soup
“The fact that we started the 1st coworking space in Athens in times of crisis actually helped people think outside the box and become go getters, innovate and create their next job not wait for it. Greeks are Entrepreneurs and we all know that crisis also brings change and opportunity with it. There is a lot of brain drain but at the same time one of our services is recruiting local talent to international companies that are trying to and looking into the market in establishing here in Athens, this way giving the talent a reason to stay.” Maria, co-founder of The Cube.
Chatting about the makers scene, it is also growing and changing:
“There are a few interesting spaces in Athens that promote the maker movement. We are very proud that Athens Makerspace is the first. The unique aspect of the maker scene in our city is that it shares the Greek idea of the community. People from different organisations want to meet in the same event, have a good time and work on a project together. We give our best to make our city better in any way we can. Fortunately, there are many opportunities for people to make their ideas a reality, share their knowledge and teach others. We understand one another and we also welcome newcomers who really want to learn and be part of the community”. In the centre of Athens there are so many hidden little shops that you can buy handmade objects or materials for your project. Some of them dating decades back. The maker scene here has a beautiful history full of handcrafters that we are trying to uphold.” Andriana, Community Manager, Athens Makerspace
a discussion with the local coworking actors.
Maria, Co-founder The Cube
“It has great potential things are changing, we have been past the hive phase and the community is maturing. The biggest problem is bureaucracy into setting up and running a business in Greece and as I already mentioned brain drain and talent moving abroad seeking for opportunities at this current phase.”
Olga, Co-founder Stone Soup
“I think the scene will become a lot more international. When we started almost 100% of our residents were Greek but now you can see 50% Greek and the other half is a mixture of different nationalities. People come either to live in Athens or to spend some time (1–3 months). The digital nomad paradigm is getting of the ground.”
Andriana, Community Manager, Athens Makerspace
“There are 3 reasons why we believe that in the future more people will prefer making, repairing, upcycling or reusing than buying.
First of, the environmental awareness is currently spreading and thankfully becoming part of our everyday life will be the main reason for that.
Secondly, many makers are finding a way to make a living through their creations ($$$!). And last but not least, despite the above, creative thinking and handmaking is a very important part of life that has been ignored in the past decades. It creates a special bond with all the stuff that surrounds us, adding so much value to everything that is custom-made rather than mass produced. Plus, it is proven to provide some serious psychotherapy in this rapidly evolving world.
We really hope that in the near future, schools will start incorporate the making aspect in their teaching methods. Building mini makerspaces in-school or asking people to do workshops for the students or even have a teacher that specializes in this field. The hands-on education is proven to be an amazing method and we believe that it’s time for schools in Athens to embrace it.
Also something that we notice more and more lately is the increase of women in the maker movement. Right now we have more women working on projects in Athens Makerspace than we ever did. We really hope and believe that this will continue as the social stereotypes that created a gender imbalance in the community, gradually fade.”

My partner and I love to travel! (I mean who doesn’t?) Therefore we decided to visit the magnificent Greek city also known as Athens! You may be sitting there questioning the title, (Cricket, Cricket) and some of you may have guessed by now. Even though Athens is the capital city of Greece and a place that's crowded with shopaholics- the sound of crickets fill the air all day long. However, I am sure the locals are used to it.
When it comes to travelling we always try to budget and can always stick to it! (That is a complete lie.) We think about the places we want to visit and places we want to stay. Wherever in the world you may visit — you do not always get to visit each and every corner of the city, so our top attractions/activities depend on the amount of time we have in that city.
How many days is enough to visit Athens?
The time spent in a city all depends on the reason for visiting. For example you may visit for the beautiful sceneries, the outstanding history or you just love to open up your wallet and get straight into those bougie stores. However, in our case we just wanted to wallow in to delicious food and visit the still standing historical attractions. We had spent just under 2 nights in Athens. That is more than enough time to see the top attractions and indulge in all the finest foods Athens has to offer.
Two nights? Run me through your itinerary…
Sure. We arrived midday of August, and as soon as we landed and stepped foot outside the airport- the August heat lashed onto our skins! This may sound overdramatic- but do bare in mind we are from England and the sun does not do us great favours! As I was saying, the heat was a lot and we had to find transport to reach us to our accommodation. I love to use public transport when we travel to a foreign country and I am slightly against using taxis all the time unless it’s needed. Only because it takes away the enjoyment of feeling what it is like living like a local. However, I did regret this as soon as we reached because :
BUT mainly because
2. Public transport was not looking promising- it was overly crowded and that’s not what you want when you are carrying around your suitcase and a few other bags. So eventually we found a cab (baring in mind this took up to an hour) that took us straight to our accommodation.
Once we reached our apartment — we freshened up and gushed ourselves with sunscreen lotion! (Wearing sunscreen lotion sometimes feels like you are going to war with the sun — I mean you kind of are if you think about it.)
We decided to visit the most famous attractions of Athens first- I mean it would be an insult not to! The Acropolis and The Parthenon. On the way there I was imagining what it would look like — of course I knew the scenery would be beautiful but photos do not do justice — it looked incredible! ( Now for those of you that do not know what the The Acropolis is — well then you will just have to Google it.) It was a sight that caught my eye. Stairs took you straight to the top of the attraction and there you could take in the breath-taking views. (I will leave some helpful tips at the end, so do have a look.)
Next, we were starving — so we decided to take our last few photos and get some lunch/dinner (can we call that chinner?) We wanted to try Greek food- however, when it comes to being a vegetarian it is not that simple, especially in Europe.
First stop: Street Souvlaki — Gyros time! How was it? Personally, I liked it. It was stuffed with aubergine, courgette, halloumi cheese and chips and drizzled with chilli jam. Ok, for those of you that don’t love their vegetables this may not sound appealing — but it was good, I liked it. My husband on the other hand, ‘eh’. For those of you that don’t know what that means, it means, well it means ‘eh’.
Next cheeky stop: crêpes anyone? Yes please! Whatever happens on holiday stays on holiday and in your belly. Dessert is a must on holiday so we found a cute little dessert shop that were making crêpes and the smell dragged us in! We bought a crepe to share, (which we don’t usually do, but hey sharing is caring.) The smell of Nutella tickled by taste buds and to top it of with some Strawberries.
Day 2: Don’t cha wish you girlfriend liked to shop like me? Don’t cha… (no not really)
The above title is giving mixed messages to you all — Yes, Athens is great for shopping — but we visited a few stores and we were done! I guess shopping isn’t for everyone. But for those of you that love shopping the main place to visit would be Ermou Street.
Next, we decided to visit: The Acropolis Museum
Which was filled with historical artefacts from the ancient times. It was fascinating and definitely worth the visit. Below the museum lay a phenomenal ancient civilisation which has been preserved very well. Archaeologists had used the remains of what was found to get an idea of what the different areas were used for.
Lastly, we decided to go for dinner before we called it a night. We decided to fill our bellies with indian food, so we visited Namaste — which is a walking distance from the museum. The food was delicious. Authentic? Yes, very much.
That was all for Athens. Next stop — Naxos! But hey that’s for another day.
Check out the helpful tips below:
2. Keep a hat, sunglasses, water and sunscreen with you at all times. ( if you didn’t guess so already — it gets kind of hot.)
3. I would recommend to book a taxi when arriving in Athens to take you to your accommodation. Taxis were a nightmare to find/contact. (Uber does work in Athens — so we used this. For the rest of your trip you can use public transport but the scheduled times are not always correct.)
4. There is a lot of walking involved when you want to visit the main attractions — I do recommend hiring a car. Unless you love to walk — then go ahead!
5. Greek Salad is amazing! Definitely try it out.
6. Baklava is popular in Greece so I would try this too.

Stepping off the metro and into the sun-drenched streets of Athens feels like opening a history book with the pages still whispering secrets. The air carries a warm, dry breeze laced with the scent of jasmine and grilled souvlaki. You turn a corner, and there it is: the Acropolis, standing guard over the city like an old friend greeting you after years apart.
No photograph truly captures the magic of the Acropolis. The way the Parthenon’s marbled columns glow rose-gold at dusk, or how the ancient stones hum with stories of philosophers and poets cannot be fully conveyed. Standing before this magnificent ancient structure, you can directly feel the wonder created by human creativity and perseverance. The Parthenon, standing firm for 2,500 years, is not merely a building but a symbol of human civilization that transcends time, offering a moment that stays in your heart.
Lose yourself in Plaka, Athens’ old neighborhood nestled at the Acropolis foot. Cobblestone lanes twist between pastel houses draped in bougainvillea, their wobbly pavement echoing every step you take. Every corner reveals a tiny kafenío spilling laughter and card games, a cat sunning itself on a doorstep, or an artisanal shop selling hand-painted ceramics. Stay close to a map, but feel free to get delightfully lost — each turn brings a new discovery.
In Monastiraki, the pulse of modern Athens beats alongside relics of every era. Street musicians serenade you near the flea market, where you can barter for vinyl records, vintage postcards, or a well-loved leather bag. Perch on the marble steps of Hadrian’s Library, feeling centuries-old stones under your fingertips while absorbing the vibrant energy of the streets.
Walking through Athens, you’ll discover the remarkable coexistence of modern and ancient. You might be strolling down a busy shopping street and suddenly encounter the ruins of a Roman-era amphitheater, or see columns of the 2,000-year-old ancient Agora standing right next to a modern coffee shop. Especially at sunset, the ancient ruins take on an almost living quality in the golden light that embraces the city.
With every step, the pavement beneath your feet seems to tell stories of the past. When you place your hand on an old stone wall, the warmth of the stone that has stood in that place for thousands of years creates a connection to the past through your palm. In Athens’ narrow alleyways, echoes sometimes reverberate, sounding almost like the whispers of ancient Greeks.
During my stay, I had the opportunity to visit the historic Piraeus Port on a business trip. As Athens’ main harbor for over 2,500 years, Piraeus offers a fascinating blend of maritime heritage and modern commerce. The bustling port, one of the largest in the Mediterranean, serves as Greece’s gateway to the world and a reminder of the nation’s enduring connection to the sea.
Walking along the waterfront, I watched massive cruise ships and cargo vessels docked alongside traditional fishing boats, their colorful hulls bobbing gently in the harbor. The scent of salt water mingled with the aroma of fresh seafood from tavernas lining the marina. Locals call this area “the heart of Greek shipping,” and it’s easy to see why — the energy here is different from central Athens, more cosmopolitan yet deeply rooted in maritime tradition.
After my meetings concluded, I explored the charming neighborhoods surrounding the port. Mikrolimano, with its horseshoe-shaped marina lined with seafood restaurants, offered stunning views where I watched fishermen mending their nets — a practice unchanged for centuries. In Pasalimani, elegant yachts suggested modern luxury while the nearby Archaeological Museum of Piraeus housed bronze statues recovered from the harbor’s depths, a testament to the port’s ancient significance.
The contrast between Piraeus and central Athens provided a fuller understanding of Greek identity — while the Acropolis represents Greece’s philosophical and cultural heritage, Piraeus embodies its seafaring spirit and commercial prowess that have sustained the nation throughout history.
On my last evening, I climbed Filopappou Hill just as the sun dipped below the Aegean horizon. The city sprawled beneath me — rust-red rooftops giving way to olive groves and distant azure. A street musician began to strum a haunting melody on his bouzouki, each note drifting through the twilight haze. I closed my eyes and let the music, the breeze, the ancient stones all blend together. In that instant, Athens wasn’t just a city of ruins; it was a living masterpiece, forever echoing with the laughter, dreams, and tears of everyone who ever called it home.
Athens isn’t about rushing from one selfie spot to the next. It’s about pausing to feel time fold onto itself — sharing sweet moments with locals at dawn, or watching street life unfold as light dances across the Acropolis. It’s a place that invites you to slow down, to breathe in history, and to savor both the grand and the minute details of daily life. When you leave, you carry a piece of that magic with you — a sense of grounded wonder and the comforting knowledge that some moments are eternal.
Safe travels, dear friend. May your heart be as full as mine was, and may Athens whisper its stories to you, too.

Daily news digests from the field, mainly for volunteers and refugees on the route, but also for journalists and other parties.

The night I slept in Exarcheia was perhaps the turning point. My phone had been stolen, I had been caught at the airport six times, each time returned. I had even once dyed my hair blond and worn coloured lenses to appear more ‘European’ — it seems so ridiculous now.
In Exarcheia I was surrounded by hashashin, every nation, class and colour united in smoking weed, perhaps the best form of integration there is. It was cold, January 2017, and I was lucky, because it was the only night that I slept outside, unlike so many others.
I woke the next morning and came across another guy, also young like me, with green eyes, from Latakia. He had also slept on the street that night, but he looked so clean I could not believe he was sleeping rough. Seeing him, a guy more or less my age in the same situation, made me realise that I was not alone and that there were so many others like me trying to find a way to survive. After so many failures, sleeping on the street, losing so much money on wasted attempts to smuggle myself out of Greece, I began to understand that this was not the path for me.
That morning at 5am I went to Katekhaki (the Greek asylum service) and I also received my first fine for not paying my metro ticket. I took the fine, smiled, said, ‘efharisto poly’ (thank you very much in Greek) and kept on towards Katekhaki, throwing away the paper fine on the way.
This was the first fine of forty similar fines I would receive over the next two years, thanks to the incredible Greek system of fining people who clearly cannot pay their tickets. As a conscientious member of Greek society now, I pay my monthly transport, but those fines amounted to 1,200 euros. Of course, I never ever thought of that at the time.
Why did I go to Katekhaki? Because six months previously I had not attended my asylum interview — I had been far too focused on the idea of getting out of Greece to find my brother in Sweden. Besides, no one helped you in Greece, there was no accommodation, the only option for me was the squats. It did not feel like a place that offered stability, or a future. But now it seemed like I needed to change my plan, and so I went to Katekhaki and took my asylum card and the date for my interview, which was to be three months later. I returned to Exarcheia, managed to stay in a squat for three days and there met a group of Spanish people who were to offer me my first place to stay.
I began to plan. To me, the most important things was finding a job, and so I thought about what seemed to me to be a previous life, but one that had given me experiences that now I could draw upon.
In Damascus I had always been interested in technology — my brother had bribed me to do well in my exams with the promise of a laptop. He tricked me and gave the laptop to someone else, but then relented and bought me a newer one; he could see how much it meant to me I think.
I had studied technology in college for a while and then in Turkey I had managed to get some work at Vodaphone and had started to study coding. Whenever I needed to learn something I went to one place: youtube. Since Damascus, through Turkey and here in Greece, it is always the place I go to for learning new things, for inspiration and motivation.
I began to work, buying old phones and then mending and updating them and selling them on. I even made money online — just imagine 989 euros in my paypal, untouchable because there was no account for it to be transferred to. No one would accept my Greek Asylum white card as valid ID. I felt as if I was some sort of ethereal phantom, magically working online, but for no material benefit, except for the personal satisfaction of seeing the numbers on the screen and dreaming about what I would do with the money if it was physically in my possession.
Many things have happened since then, many of which we will all experience in our lives as refugees — the struggle to find a job, a home, a way to build a life. I realise I am not unique in this sense and this motivated me to try and help others in any way I can.
For a year I was lucky to be involved with a youth centre which gave me accommodation in exchange for volunteering there. I was always trying to think of new ways of making money within the narrow confines of Greek law where you cannot have a bank account unless you have a job. I helped people write CVs, gave courses on computer software, computer literacy, anything that I felt could be helpful for people like me looking for a future here.
I got a job, went to the training and got 99% on my coding exam, although to be honest it was my third retake. Then the company told me to go home, because the Greek system did not issue my AFM (tax number) fast enough. I tried everything, applying from different offices, with my company (which arranges all the necessary visas, AFMs and accommodation for their foreign workers), on my own, with a Greek person, anything! In the Exarcheia office where I originally registered I went with a Greek friend to check on the progress of my AFM which I had submitted a month previously. Eventually one clerk at the office whispered to my friend, ‘the person you need to talk to is in the toilet. Wait until he comes out and try and get him before he goes into the office.’ A couple of minutes later a large man with an even larger belly waddled out of the toilet, sideways. My friend tried to speak with him, but all she received was a dismissive gesture and a grunt. I had felt as if I had done everything, I had never given up, I had given so much of my time to learning and teaching others and had got this job, only to lose it because of a stupid bureaucracy.
It seems so funny now, looking back on it, because a month after that we returned and I managed to get my AFM, from the same toad-man. It had arrived maybe 10 days after I had visited the first time, but they had never bothered to call me.
In my despair my Greek friend put it in perspective. She too had suffered from this system, it was not specifically discrimination because I was a refugee, but rather an inefficient system that makes it impossible even for ordinary Greeks to do apparently simple things. Obtaining an AFM was my right as someone with residency, I had to be reminded that it would come eventually, that this was part of the journey, even if it felt as if Greece wanted me to personally suffer.
That was two months ago. Now, one AFM, a bank account and a 1,200 euro fine later, I am working as a software developer in a company that I dreamed of working for when I was in Syria. I could not have done this in Germany, France, Belgium or Holland, and so, although I spent so much time and money trying to escape this country, it turns out that this is one of the few places I can actually get the experience I need to continue my career.
What kept me going after that night in Exarcheia, before that in Turkey and Lesvos, was always having a plan and working out how to make it happen. In every situation, even if it is new, or potentially stressful and unfamiliar, I see opportunities to explore, make new contacts, learn something new. I truly believe that anyone can do what I have done, they just need focus, flexibility and a willingness to learn.
Be independent, do not follow the bad habits of others, and recognize that sometimes what works for others may not work for you. Make the most of your time and plan your day, week, month, even your year. Wherever you go there are opportunities to learn. Even in Athens, where I thought there was nothing, there are lots of different places that offer amazing training in languages and other skills.
Live in the present, but always think about the next step, and trust yourself. And use youtube!

Socrates’ borough or deme was Alopece, located in the immediate suburbs of Athens to the southeast. In his constitutional reforms of 508 BC, Cleisthenes identified and distributed the hundred and thirty-nine demes among ten administrative “tribes,” replacing four mutually hostile kinship tribes. He designed the new mapping to break up family dynasties and regional interest groups, so as to force people from different regions of Attica to work together (ch. 2*). The new tribes were given important political functions; for instance, each tribe annually elected a general to serve as one of the commanders of the Athenian armed forces for that year.
Each tribe also contributed fifty members to the Council every year, and each deme received proportionate representation within their tribe’s cohort of members. Socrates’ Alopece, belonging to the tribe of Antiochis, sent ten citizens to the Council annually. Socrates himself would serve his deme as a Council representative in the year 407/6 BC (see ch. 19.4*).
After the deme system was configured based on the geographical location of boroughs in Attica, one’s membership in it became hereditary. Consequently, the son always belonged to the deme of his father, even if he moved to another location and resided within the geographical boundaries of a different deme. In reality, however, people tended to remain in the same villages for centuries, as was often the case in Europe before recent times. Socrates’ deme in the suburbs of Athens was convenient for a man who frequented the city streets, so it seems likely that he continued to live in his ancestral home in Alopece.
When he was eighteen, Socrates was presented to the demarch or borough chairman as a candidate for citizenship. Since the city of Athens kept no vital records, family members and close acquaintances had to swear that he had reached his eighteenth birthday. They also had to swear that his father was a citizen. In the year that Socrates came of age, Pericles pushed through a bill that required that not only a man’s father, but also his mother must be Athenian in order to qualify for citizenship. Socrates must have met the more stringent requirement, for his name was duly entered in the deme’s register of youth eligible for citizenship.
After the deme certified Socrates and his age-mates, they sent the records to the Council, which conducted a review (dokimasia) to verify that the information was correct. After this last step, Socrates would have become a citizen and, therefore, eligible to participate in civic processes, except those with an age requirement. For instance, to hold some offices a citizen must have attained the age of thirty. Public records henceforth would certify his age and thus eligibility for office — and for military service.
Hereafter he was officially known by his “demotic” name, Socrates of Alopece, a designation meant to identify citizens with their boroughs more closely than with their families, so as to counteract the powerful influence of family groups (indicated by the patronymic, for instance, Socrates son of Sophroniscus) on the politics of the city.
Socrates now became a cadet or ephebe (ephēbos), subject to military training and assignment. In the fourth century, cadets received rigorous military training, performed in parades and exhibitions and served in garrisons around the city for two years. Spartan cadets had received rigorous military and survival training from an early time. It is not clear, however, how much formal training Socrates received in his time as a cadet in mid-fifth-century Athens. He may have served on garrison and patrol duty in the city and the borders of Attica but with little formal training.
Fortunately for Socrates, around 451 when he’d come of age, Cimon was invited to return early to Athens from his exile and negotiated a five-year truce with the Spartans whom the great statesman favored (see ch. 2.5*). Cimon then led an expedition to raid Persian territory in Egypt and Cyprus while Socrates was still serving at home as a cadet. About the time Socrates finished his two-year training, Cimon died and a treaty was negotiated with the Persian Empire, initiating a period of relative peace for several years.
As Socrates completed his military training, after having finished his brief formal education some years before, he succeeded at the age of twenty to the estate of an independent citizen in 449. He came of age just at the time when a thoroughgoing democracy was being instituted in Athens for the first time. Socrates would continue his education by participating in a government that called on the talents of all its citizens to carry out its business. As we shall see, Socrates never aimed at political leadership, but he could not escape holding offices or, in what was considered an equally political responsibility, participating in the armed services of Athens. He would serve bravely in the army and would, by chance or by fate, hold the very highest office in the government — for one day.
In Socrates’ time, Athens led the Greek world in drawing on the talents of all its citizens to govern the city. As Pericles would say some eighteen years later in his famous funeral oration, speaking of the comprehensive Athenian experience with excusable pride, “In summary, I declare that our whole city is the school of Greece.”

On a recent trip to Athens, I visited the Niarchos Center, a new cultural complex just south of Athens housing the Greek National Library (GNL) and the Greek National Opera (GNO). The 566 million euro project, designed by architect Renzo Piano, was completed in 2016 by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.
This place is unlike anything else in Athens. Or anywhere really. It really feels like — the future.
A beautiful, glass-clad building gleams over the city with a long reflective canal glimmering by its side.
The modernistic building feeds into an organized labyrinth of small beautiful parks and gardens composed of Mediterranean climate shrubbery.
The complex is free and open to the public to “flaner”, explore, and play.
While we didn’t visit the Opera House or the Library which are both supposedly world-class, we strolled along the outside spaces and walked with our jaws figuratively dropped in awe, impressed by the beauty and detail of all the elements that just seemed — to work. The spaces were clean and well-maintained, but not sterile. People of all ages were walking, children were playing, teenagers were gathering in some of the nooks and crannies but in a fun not sketchy way. There were bike stations that were being used — but not abused.
The element that impressed us the most was the playground — or rather, the playgrounds, with an s. There were multiple “play” spaces for different ages. Even for adults!
For the youngest crowd (10month — 2 years) where we spent the most time, the playground was composed of countless jungle gym structures mostly made of wood — both aesthetic and functional. There was a manual lever system spewing water to play with. The kids ran around barefoot laughing and screaming. The parents were sitting on the benches around, relaxed. It was the best playground I’ve ever seen.
And again, it was that perfect balance between clean (but not sterile feeling) and utilised. A resonant sweet spot. I imagine this usage is every parks and recreation enthusiast’s dream. Occasionally we’d see a security or maintenance person walk by. So we knew that this beautiful fragile equilibrium was maintained by a very well-planned and methodical “back office”.
Now apparently, the privately-owned complex is to be donated to the Greek state and publicly-run. And the big question that everyone is asking is — can this fragile sweet spot persist if the complex is run by the state?
The doubt is founded — especially when you visit the numerous public parks across Athens which are abandoned and dilapidated with defunct playgrounds. And though some parks like the Pedion tou Areos are lush and quite beautiful, they are coined as “dangerous” as pockets of “immigrants, drug addicts, and radicals” inhabit the spaces. So families will tend to avoid these parks.
As a new parent, I’ve only recently been attuned to the huge importance of parks and green spaces in cities.
The contrast between the Niarchos Center and the Pedion tou Areos is flagrant — and frustrating. With the Niarchos Center, you see that the harmonious populated park CAN work. But why doesn’t it work — with a beautiful park right in central Athens?
This being said, the Pedion tou Areos has a certain charm. A charm that actually artist communities seem to be drawn to. And these communities want to engage people to the park’s alluring ecosystem.
So how do we find that right mix to create a sustainable harmonious park space for all ages to feel free, safe, and relaxed?
Is it a question of public versus private management? Top-down or bottom-up planning?
We’ll be back in a couple months to see if and how things have evolved with both parks.
And back to the Niarchos Center, we haven’t even explored the intricate ecological design of the complex — with 10,000m2 of solar panels and the labyrinth of parks and gardens that I’ve alluded to that serve as a roof garden for the building.
Athens is such a rich, complicated, juxtaposing city — I imagine an urban planner’s heaven and hell.
But in any case, if you go to Athens, make sure to visit the Niarchos Center. AND the Pedion tou Areos park.

Three small islands off the coast of Athens you need to visit,https://medium.com/@sm3672/three-small-islands-off-the-coast-of-athens-you-need-to-visit-65ae7425d776,"Sign up

Beyond Mykonos, Santorini, Crete, and even Athens, there is much more to Greece than these touristy destinations. Three small day-trip islands you should visit next time you visit Greece are Aegina, Hydra, and Poros. Each island off the coast of Greece has a unique history because the city-states of modern-day Greece were not unified until the mid-17th century, following the Greek revolution against the Ottoman empire.
Aegina is one of the closest islands to the coast of Athens. From Piraeus port, the island is a short forty-five minuet to hour ferry ride. The water surrounding Aegina is very clean, thus home to sea urchins. Don’t let them deter you, just use caution when swimming in the shallow pebbled water surrounding the coast because the views are well worth the swim. Paralia Marathona beach is a short drive from the port, and the views from the beach of nearby islands look like a scene from Jurassic park. The mountains jut out of the water just a few kilometers away, covered in greenery, and appear untouched. When in Aegina you must visit the Temple of Aphena, which is about a 15-minute drive from the port. The temple is the second best-preserved temple in all of Greece, and directly faces the city of Athens. The island of Aegina is also known for being one of the few places in Greece that grows pistachios. When returning to the port, it is paramount that you try any number of the many pistachio products sold downtown. My favorite was the pistachio butter which tasted exactly like Nutella. Some friends of mine loved the pistachio liquor, which I recommend asking to try but wasn’t my favorite.
My second favorite day-trip island is Hydra, which is about a two-hour ferry ride from Athens. Hydra is a very small, narrow island that does not permit cars, motorcycles, or ATVs of any kind. So you will find donkeys lining the port, awaiting to carry travelers and their luggage up the mountainside. Hydra does have beaches, but they are only accessible by boat on the opposite side of the island from the port. There are cliff-jumping sites that line the rest of the coast. Apart from swimming, there is an island museum and a golden star art structure you can view from the coast side, which is a short walk from the port. Hydra also has cliffside bars and cafes with some of the best views I have seen in Greece. I highly recommend getting breakfast or dinner and taking in the views for a few hours because they are what Instagram is made of.
My third island recommendation is Poros, which like Aegina, is also about an hour ferry ride from the Piraeus port. The views from Athens to Poros are unmatched. You pass many seaside cliffs, and uninhabited islands and may even see some dolphins as I did. The water changes from deep blue to bright seafoam green along the way and is some of the clearest, brightest, saltiest water I have ever swam in. Upon our arrival to Poros, we witnessed a greek wedding take place just off the coast on a tiny island that was just big enough for a church and about fifty standing guests. The port town is quiet and faces another costal town of the mainland less than a kilometer away, creating a natural canal. The townspeople are extremely hospitable and grateful for our small purchases. These islands also heavily rely on tourism for revenue but receive much less foot traffic than the better-known islands. After browsing the shops, we followed the clock tower signs through the mountainside homes to the highest point of Poros. At the top, we were welcomed with an amazing sunset view of the surrounding islands. Because Poros is a much smaller island, their souvenirs were very cheap, so I stalked up on postcards, a new towel, and some sunglasses before we headed back to Athens.
I have found that these smaller islands just off the coast of the mainland are much more affordable, welcoming, and just as stunning as the well-known islands of Mykonos, Santorini, and Crete. Greece is all about taking a step out of the hustle and bustle of life, so I encourage everyone to take a few day trips to the quiet and forgotten islands and truly get a feel for the authentic greek culture.

Lugged my guitar on a crowded tram during rush hour. It’s killing me inside that I can’t…move!
Fingers getting stiff and cold and I know, I just know they are going to play tricks on me when an audience is watching. I want to shake some blood into them, but that would mean smacking strangers, which of course I’m not going to do, so I shove them in my pockets.
Twang! A passenger bangs the guitar and it strums in its case. Wincing at the thought of damage, but she’s been fine on every airplane and bus, so she’ll be fine one more time. Right?
Right?
Some bartender told me I could play an open mic tonight. Sounded fun. Problem: no idea where the venue he mentioned is. Hoping to find out by returning to the same bar, asking the same guy.
But it’s getting under my skin! The thought of playing in front of people. Stomach jumping in anticipation. Some things don’t get better the more you do them, huh? Last time I performed was in Morocco.
Squeezed and popped out of the tram. Fresh air and a little personal space. Sun sinks. Shadows pool out vast, dark and cold between buildings. Ah, I can shake my fingers now. OK. Let’s find this place.
Hope that same bartender is working so I can ask again. Nope. New faces. This shot of mine is getting longer and longer, isn’t it? Ordered the same drink I had last time. Can’t remember its name. Gin, lick-lipping fresh blended berry juice, and tons of shaved ginger for heat. Salt on only half of the rim for a counter melody. A murky pond to drown a little stage fright in, no? Ah, why not drink two. People party late here, so I might be early yet.
Where is that music place someone mentioned? Where you can play an open mic? The other guys said next door, but it’s all dark windows, rolled-down shutters, graffiti. There is no “next door.”
No idea, tonight’s bartender says while scooping ice out of the bin.
Did I drag the guitar all this way for nothing? Is it dead weight for the night out?
Any idea what the place is called?
He said it was basement, something. Basement.
The place is called Basement?
That or it’s in a basement. Details are hazy on this one, my guy. Rumor and hearsay. Urban legends. Local folklore.
He laughs, and asks his buddy in Greek.
The buddy tells me go to the wooden door on the corner. That sounds like what you’re looking for.
Drain drink, pay up, and head to that wooden door in the empty alley. But this is just the door to somebody’s apartment. Greek names written on paper tags next to the buzz-in buttons. I still try it, just in case. It’s locked. No signs for a bar, a venue, a club, or anything.
But next to it is a small door. Black door on a black wall. And scrawled in white chalk today’s rain has half washed away, ‘the party is here.’
I test this knob, and it does open. Bright red lighting on dark carpeted steps. A letter U in white backlight. This must be it!
Down saggy steps to an empty basement with a few couches here and there. A stage the same height as the rest of the room.
You with the band? Someone asks.
Nope. Heard there was open mic.
Later, maybe. A band plays first.
Ah, I might drink for a while then.
Ha! Hm. Yes, listen. You guys use the place as a bar, but I’ve been trying to get you all to understand what the fuck is really going on here because there is.
He stretches out his fingers, grasping for concepts.
More to it. But have a drink, maybe today, you listen, next time, maybe play. Maybe play tonight if you’re ready. But it’s becoming a members only listening club soon.
Sure. No problem. Got a place I can leave my guitar? He smiles, and nods. Puts it in the sound room. Walking lighter now — nice.
Two Euro beers. No wonder the bar part outshines the other concepts. Signs scrawled in marker. The bar itself is a salvaged bookshelf or something. It’s not meant to be a bar. The place is furnished with scavenged, repurposed, improvised objects.
The place fills up with twenty and thirty-something Greeks. Nose rings, choppy hair, tattoos, black skinny jeans, dark shirts, angular, Goth jackets, punky boots, silver rings, cross earrings, and so on.
Maybe everybody wants to hear Punk tonight.
But no, not Punk, Funk begins. Well above my skillset. This is the band. When the open mic starts, it’s the twelve bar blues of all things.
Blues. One of the first things you learn how to do on guitar. The blues really gets the crowd going. Sweet Home Chicago and Miss the Mississippi have the Greeks swaying and nodding.
Why do punk scene kids in Athens care about Chicago and Mississippi? I ask someone. I was there in another life, he says longingly. Hmm. Lot of people in those places say that about Greece, you know. The islands. He laughs and shrugs. Must have been a recent past life, I tell him. 1930s, maybe. A girl tells me there is a whole blues conservatory in Athens as well.
Fingertips itch and I can feel those same five notes you learn to play for Blues soloing under them — it makes my fingers wiggle to hear guitar playing I like.
The Blues. It grooves addictively. It cycles like the seasons, or a woman’s period. It’s sad like life. It howls like a wildcat and it bitches like a bad day. You can do it in a jam session and you get to tell your story or play your guitar solo on it, but then the shape of it stays the same and it’s someone else’s turn.
Didn’t get to play that night. Maybe next week, if they play the Blues again. But I did think I began to understand something, like I began to get it. Either that or I was drunk.

In high stakes card games, you’re told to look for “tells,” those subconscious trademarks of what a player is thinking and planning. I confess to not being very good at card games, or people games for that matter. Case in point:
I once had a girlfriend — mainly a long-distance relationship that lasted two years. We were very close for several months in that period, but in the last six-to-eight months, what mainly happened was that I counseled and consoled her over late night phone calls that, yes, someday we would be together — that one day we would live in the same town. I still lived in Knoxville, she, completely across the state in Jackson.
Every night we spoke, by the end of the evening she had grown calmer and more assured; then, the next night, we started all over again, working our way through her anxiety and fears, which were real enough, because jobs and job security are also real enough and nothing certain is waiting just across that next county line.
I wanted to live in the same town with her, too, so it wasn’t like I was completely at peace. Still, when you live alone in a college town, your options for night-life, or any social life, tend to be better than living back at home in a provincial berg with your not-always-agreeable parents.

“A democracy’s biggest mistake was democratic.”
He returned from the Peloponnesian War.His armor was dented. His pay was late.But it wasn’t the Spartans that broke him.It was the silence that followed.
Athens had won nothing. Sparta had gained everything.And the city had changed.
The Agora buzzed, not with orders or war songs,but with sophists selling logic by the drachma,young men rehearsing cleverness,and elders nodding at whatever pleased the assembly.
And there, always in the middle —Socrates. Barefoot, broad-nosed, unbending.Asking questions like jabs.Pacing like a gadfly on marble.
He wasn’t charming. He wasn’t kind.But he cut through illusion like a blade.What is justice? What is good? Who decides?Questions that burned longer than any temple flame.
The soldier watched. Listened. Thought. And he realized: Socrates was the only one still fighting. Not for land. Not for gold. But for the soul of the city.And the city hated it.
Because the war had left them tired. Tired of losing. Tired of doubting. Tired of mirrors.
So when the trial came, when Meletus and Anytus stood before the courtaccusing him of impiety and corrupting the youth,they were really charging him with something else:
Making Athens think.
501 jurors. Two clay pots. A few more votes for death than acquittal. Democracy, exact and cold. No blades. No exile.Just hemlock in a small cup.
And Socrates drank it like he’d known all along.They said it was for asebeia.And corrupting the youth.But what they really meant was: He asked questions we didn’t want answered.

On Saturday, January 9, 2021, I ran the Athens Big Fork Marathon (ABF). This race takes place on the Athens Big Fork trail which runs through the Ouachita Mountains starting in the Big Fork community, which is between Mount Ida, Arkansas, and Glenwood, Arkansas. The race itself runs over eight mountains to the 13.1-mile turnaround point, and then you run back over those same eight mountains to the finish.
This is one of the hardest courses I have ever run, and I have run the Pikes Peak Marathon twice (including doubling once). Unlike Pikes Peak, where there is just one long climb before you spend the rest of the race descending the mountain, the ABF course requires you to climb eight mountains two times each. At least the ABF trail is at a much lower altitude than Pikes Peak. Not being able to breathe along with the many climbs would make the course really tough. I have the utmost admiration for runners who have run courses such as Hardrock or Leadville where you have to climb multiple mountains multiple times and do that at altitude.
ABF is a very hilly course. The overall elevation gain over 26.2 miles is 4600 feet. The highest peak is 1850 feet and the lowest peak is 1050 feet. Here is the elevation profile for the course:

As a follow up to last week’s blog (on the ‘nod of recognition’) I want to reflect on how to connect with different demographics in our preaching.
Francis Schaeffer talked about Lystra and Athens and Romans chapter 1:18–32 as Paul ‘addressing the world without a Bible’.
In all these places Paul is addressing a common religious consciousness that is found in every society and every person. This religious consciousness is articulated differently from person to person, and sometimes it is not articulated at all.
In Acts Paul tackles people without a Bible is very different ways. In the best known of these sermons he preaches in Athens to intellectuals who were used to expressing and evaluating new ideas (Acts 17), using careful reasoning and making use of well-chosen cultural references to connect with his target audience.
Dan Strange, in his book Plugged In, describes the process of Paul’s preaching in Athens using four E’s:
Enter — Explore — Expose — Evangelise
Strange’s pattern reminds the preacher that before speaking there is a need to observe and listen in each situation. Preachers are taught to carefully exegete Scripture, but they are not always taught to exegete their audiences. Both these tasks are important if we are to communicate effectively.
It is important to note that both here and in Lystra, Paul does not quote any biblical text, but his sermons in both places are underpinned by a scriptural God-centred worldview.
What is interesting is that Paul’s approach in Athens is very different from what we see Lystra. He does not preach in the same way to a farming community as he does to the philosophers in Athens.
In Athens Paul uses careful reasoning and quotes from poets and philosophers; in Lystra, by contrast, he makes use of more common place points of contact such as the cycles of the seasons and patterns of sunshine and rainfall. These were the things that preoccupied the thinking of those who lived in a rural community that was dependant on the land.
The key for the preacher in Paul’s flexible strategy is that from the same basic theological premise that the Lord God is the creator and sustainer of all, he preaches a distinct message to these very different communities. In this way Paul sought to connect with the reality that God has put eternity into our hearts.
Coming back to the four E’s, I would guess that most preachers are well-practiced in the art of exposing and evangelising, but fewer are experienced at entering and exploring.
Entering and exploring involve taking a deep dive into cultural context in which we are preaching. This involves getting a feel for the things that engage a particular congregation.
Time spent asking good questions and listening carefully to the congregation will always be repaid in the ability to connect with people more effectively.
Good preachers understand Scripture and understand people.
Different genres of Scripture require different handling. You cannot preach a Psalm in the same way you preach on a letter.
Different congregations also require different handling. It is worth asking of your congregation, “Is this more like Lystra or Athens, or is it something in between?”

Kea, part of the Cyclades islands in Greece, is a quiet getaway not far from Athens. Unlike its busy neighbors like Mykonos, Kea offers a peaceful retreat with lovely beaches and small, friendly villages.
Once you arrive, the scenic harbor of Korissia welcomes you. A short trip takes you to Ioulida, the island’s capital, where you can stroll through old pathways and see an ancient stone lion from the 6th century BC.
Food lovers will enjoy Kea’s fresh seafood and local dishes, like “paspala”, a tasty pork dish. For the adventurous, there are trails to explore the island’s natural beauty, leading you through olive groves and to hidden beaches like Spathi and Koundouros.
Kea is a place to relax, enjoy good food, and discover nature’s charm, all without straying too far from the bustling city life of Athens.

Today, we think of true and false as natural opposites, but this set of antonyms did not emerge until the philosopher Plato framed them as such [1]. For the Greeks before Plato, ‘true and hidden’ and ‘correct and false’ were the natural pair of opposites in language. Truth and falsehood are, for us today, a matter of representing the world one way or another because, for us, language is a matter of representing the world in one way or another. Thus:
But language before the widespread prevelance of literacy did not function as a means of representing the world. Rather, language functioned by either showcasing or concealing something. Unlike for us today, for the early Athenians:
In early Greek culture (and many other indigenous cultures — think of Vedic chants, native poetry), people spoke in memorable, formulaic, and repetitive patterns so that information could be easily learned and remembered. As rhetorical critic Walter J. One states — this was possible by ‘saying over and over again what has been learned arduously over ages.’ In that context, it would have been risky to say something different, to play with the language, or to innovate because to do so would run the risk of losing knowledge that had been painstakingly collected over centuries. The world before the written language was an oral world (as opposed to a literate world), and the experience of hearing language was totally different for those audiences. In the oral world, hearers empathized with speakers and participated in the scenes their words evoked. There was a tangible sense of commonality that spread through the experience of sound that was shared by speakers and hearers alike. Sound comes from within one person’s body and enters another person’s body. As Ong puts it, in oral cultures where words exist only and exclusively as sounds, ‘with no reference whatsoever to any visually perceptible text, and no awareness of even the possibility of such a text, the phenomenology of sound enters deeply into human beings’ feel for existence, as processed by the spoken word.’ All of this dramatically changed with the introduction of the widespread use and understanding of writing.
Sophists and the written language
Literacy changed people’s relationship to language, and by changing their relationship to language, it changed their relationship to truth. With the spread of literacy, poetry no longer needed to carry the hefty responsibility of preserving the knowledge of an entire culture. Rather than be swept up in the rhythmic tide of a poem as sung by a bard, Greeks in Plato’s time could read it themselves. Whereas prior to literacy, people may have had an intuitive sense that language referred to the world, after the rise of literacy they had an explicit theory to explain how language related to the world. Once that happened, it became possible to think of truth as representational and symbolic in the same way. It was Plato who essentially invented a new understanding of language as representing the world, rather than functioning to bring something to light so it could be perceived. And he did so for explicitly political reasons.
Plato felt that the truth problem in the tricky politics of the war with Sparta was caused by a group of wealthy and influential statesmen — the Sophists. Plato had no shortage of bad things to say about the Sophists, in part because, even though they were not from Athens, they nevertheless wielded terrific influence in the city-state. So much so, that today, we use the term Sophist to refer to one who uses slippery language to twist truth for his or her own political gain. So, how did the Sophists wield language to such a powerful effect before the written word became more widespread? The Sophists came to Athens from all corners of ancient Greece and made a fortune by giving speeches and by teaching others how to speak on topics where they would often not have any knowledge at all. They dazzled the Athenians with their style and ability to persuade practically anybody of anything. Some of Athens’s most prominent citizens — Pericles, Callias and Alcibiades — paid large sums of money for getting trained by the Sophists. This allowed Sophists to gain great political influence, but not for the benefit of Athenians, rather, for the benefit of their own home cities. The undercurrents of the beginning of the end were already starting to brew.
If you were to ask a Sophist who they were and what they did — they would say that they were international intellectuals and teachers in the arts of language and speaking. But if you were to ask the Athenian survivors, who was to most blame for the fall of Athens — they wouldn’t say Sparta or the tyrants. They would point to the Sophists who taught Athenians how to make convincing arguments for things that were simply not true.
To give a sense of what the Sophists were capable of, consider the case of the two brothers — Euthydemus and Dionysodorus — who managed to convince their opponent that it is impossible to tell a lie as follows: they first got him to agree that no one can make something that is not — because things that ‘are not’ do not exist; then they got him to agree that speaking is a kind of making; finally, they got him to agree that telling a lie is speaking what ‘is not’! Similarly, Gorgias convincingly argued that nothing exists as follows:
‘It is easy to conclude that both the existent and non-existent do not exist either. For if the non-existent exists and the existent exists, the non-existent will be the same thing as the existent as far as existence is concerned. And for this reason neither of them exists. Of course, if the existent is the same as the non-existent, it is not possible for both to exist. For if both exist, they are not the same, and if the same, both do not exist. To which the conclusion follows that nothing exists. For if neither the existent exists not the non-existent nor both, and if no additional possibility is conceivable, nothing exists!’
With their training, the Sophists convinced Callias and Alcibiades to speak on the Athenian floor, for a battle with Sparta in Sicily to free the Sicilians from Spartan control. This simple hypnotizing act caused the Athenian navy to self-destruct, lose 50,000 oarsmen, and eliminated an entire generation of fighters. Callias lost his family’s entire fortune and died penniless, while Alcibiades was banished from Athens, and Sparta installed the Thirty Tyrants in Athens, who brought democracy to an end by 404 BC, nearly 2500 years ago.
Plato thus needed to develop a different understanding of truth and language precisely so that the verbal tricks of the Sophists would not easily succeed any longer. For, to the Sophists, truth was roughly equivalent to success at winning an argument. This meant that it was very difficult to determine what made true speech true in and of itself, because truth could only be determined in the specific context by who won and who lost. Truth was limited to a particular contest between verbal combatants.
When truth shape-shifted to help the narrative
In a strange way, as the written word spread, it meant that knowledge was no longer hard-won, precious or fragile, so there was no need to scrupulously conserve it. In the pre-literary Athens, opponents accepted defeat precisely because their speech was inseparable from themselves — it was an extension of their own body and soul. Because they thought of language in this way, people were personally committed to the things they uttered. The victorious words were considered true not because of how accurately they represented reality but because, at the end of the fight, they had remained standing — like in a fight between wrestlers. Though the victor silenced his opponent’s words, he didn't disprove them. This was the problem Plato had with this form of truth. As the war with Sparta demonstrated, it was possible for a wrong position to defeat or silence a right one. Plato wanted to create a form of truth that would allow what he considered to be a wrong position to be disproved once and for all. To do this, language had to be detached from both speakers and the world. It had to become representational.
Plato and Alcibiades were critical of writing, although they were adept at using it, because they felt that it was facile and readily available. Alcibiades had high praise for people who could speak in the moment —
‘For speaking on the spot in a fitting way about whatever presents itself, and employing a swift richness of argument and vocabulary, and following with a sure track the critical moment in affairs and people’s inclinations, and using appropriate language is not a universal natural gift nor does it come from just any sort of training.’
In other words, extemporaneous speakers can respond in a more authentic and truthful way to the audience that is immediately in front of them. Extemporaneous speakers reveal themselves to their audience rather than hide behind a prefabricated speech.
In the minds of many Athenians, including Plato, the Sophists were the first to figure out how to create an alternate reality using only words, and so they were the reason that words had become detached from reality in the first place. Words may be in the world, but they most certainly are not of it, according to Gorgias. He was demonstrating how, although we may be naturally and intuitively inclined to believe that words represent reality, in fact, words refer only to other words. And when we use words to negate or contradict other words, that affects how we view reality itself — even though the only thing we are negating and contradicting is other words. This is how conspiracy theories manage to spread and thrive because we have a hard time separating the medium of the words where the denial is happening from the facts they supposedly deny. In the 5th century BCE, Gorgias understood this far better than we do today: he knew that, in a contest between facts and contradiction, contradiction wins every time. For this reason, supplying more and more facts seldom results in re-establishing the truth, once and for all. Instead of throwing more and better facts at our truth problems, Gorgias would have us become more aware of the medium of words themselves and, in particular, of words that deny or negate reality.
The power of the fabricated language
The term media literally means that something mediates between the hard facts of reality and our knowledge of those facts. Understanding the medium of words, as Gorgias may have been trying to show early Athenians is something that we must strive to do today as we struggle with not only existing disinformation, but now also with the new capacity for generated disinformation at scale through large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (genAI).
This highlights the biggest difference between Plato’s truth problem and our own today: his was silence without disproof, while our post-truth problem is disproof without silence. This is where Plato’s reformulation has come back to bite us. Language has become detached from us as it is from the world it represents. So we can say anything we want, and if we find we have contradicted ourselves or said something inconsistent, it is of very little concern to us. We can always delete a tweet, take down a post and deny that we ever said those words in the first place, or say something else. We can keep talking and talking, long after we’ve been disproven. This goes a long way toward explaining why truth has increasingly become so difficult for us to grasp today. This is also what makes it dangerous. Ancient rhetoricians acknowledged that both forms of truth were powerful tools for creating belief. This ancient oral notion of truth is re-animated when people speak spontaneously in an authentic and in-the-moment way.
Protagoras knew that stories could be more persuasive and powerful than straightforward arguments because, in a very uncertain world where it can be difficult to determine what is true, narratives give us something to hold on to. They have a sticking capacity. For example, the story of Prometheus and Epimetheus was precisely constructed by Protagoras to counter Socrates’s argument that virtue is something one is born with. The story did not need to prove the point, but only to engross his audience enough where the point would seem to be proven in the context of the story itself. This is the rhetorical power of stories and narratives — their words shape how we see and experience the world we live in. Stories effectively create a screen on reality, a screen that highlights some aspects of reality and obscures others. Stories are the houses that words build to give us the momentary experience of surety that everything in flux can pause for a moment for us to understand it. The problem arises when we don’t recognize stories as stories, when we mistake their relatively stable screen on reality for reality itself. When reality is mediated to us and when we attempt to mediate reality for others, it tends to happen in the form of a story. Oftentimes, those stories are far less recognizable as stories than the one Protagoras told. This is getting exceedingly more difficult in the era of generative AI.
Language as we know it today
After WWII, Kenneth Burke, the American literary theorist, tried to device a five-part method he called the pentad (act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose), as a means to understand how people package reality, as a means to weed out ideologies like the one that had just given rise to the war and had blindly cajoled people to commit horrendous acts. Burke believed that understanding tools of rhetoric like the pentad would make people less vulnerable to stories that package dubious political ideologies and propaganda. Long before the internet age and the impact of social media in our current age, Burke foresaw the confusion, cynicism, and manipulation made possible by the incessant flood of information. With all the new ‘information’ being generated by AI, we can only expect the ride ahead to be more turbulent.
Language is constantly shaping how we see the world. By extrapolation, large language models will shape how the world appears to us — not always in a good manner. What Protagoras would have liked us to likely see today, is that if we change the language, we’re changing the way we measure reality. When we use language, it is something that happens through us more than something we consciously choose by deliberately selecting what to say or how to say it. It is the larger structure of language that is in control, not us. That is what the 20th-century Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure meant when he said language eludes the control of our will. Language is in charge; we’re along for a ride. In other words, our use of language is guided by implicit and non-obvious rules of meaning. We inherited these structures and never observed them while they were taking shape. And yet, we are necessarily guided and constrained by those systems.
In her book Reames discusses a simple experiment that she conducted where she asked students in her class to arrange their desk in a circle [1]. They all complied. When she asked why, they said because she was the teacher. When dug a bit deeper, they realized how there was a much larger structure behind their compliance. It’s not only that Reames was their teacher, but that they needed thus good grades, to get a job, to earn money, to sustain a family, to retire in peace. They may have felt like autonomous agents at the point when they stood up to move their desk, but by the end of the class, they didn’t see it that way. This is structuralism. Do we make conscious choices guided by deliberate rationality and practical wisdom? Or are we guided by the system of meanings our psyche has absorbed, without being fully aware of it? Are the things we think as cool, funny, beautiful, sublime, sacred so deemed because of our consciously cultivated preferences? Or is it that a larger network of cultural symbols infuses perception with its norms and values without our conscious attention?
Plato may have been the Sophists’ greatest foe. He wanted to give people the tools to escape from their own ignorance where truth and reality were concerned, which was precisely what had made them susceptible to the Sophists’s way of untruths and lies. Think of the allegory of Plato’s cave. So, are we entering an era of genAI as the new Sophists? Is it a platform that is wielding large amounts of power over the psyche of the masses? Was the Athenian debacle a foreboding of what was to come 2500 years from then? How can LLMs and genAI affect this perception of truth today?
Surely, LLM and genAI have great things to contribute to our future. But given how easy it is to develop our perception of reality from the language we get to know of, it behoves us as engineers and scientists working on AI, and civic society members being exposed to it, to be aware of the pitfalls of being swayed by language and narratives, especially those coming from a species not our own.

If you’re fortunate enough to be heading to the historical city of Athens, Greece and are hoping for some delicious vegan food, you’ll be happy to know you’ll be spoilt for choice. From satisfying street food, to delicious desserts, Athens has a lot to offer in the way of vegan food and I had a fantastic time exploring that.
Actually before I get in to the restaurant recommendations, I have a few tips on how to find vegan food in Athens or anywhere really.
38 Athanasiou Diakou & Kallirois, Athina 117 43
Veganaki was my first stop during my trip. They sell a variety of Mediterranean dishes such as feta cheese, tzatziki, falafel and moussaka.
I had the vegetable oven-baked omelette, served with cashew cheese and salad. Soutzoukakia (traditional meatballs) made of chickpeas and mint, soy tzatziki and wedges. Both delicious and a great start to my week eating my way through the vegan restaurants of Athens. I also tried the apple pie cake which is literally a cake made of pastry and filled with apple pie filling- it was a little strange but really yummy.
Vegan Vandal is one of the best street food spots in Athens, amongst other things they offer burgers, nuggets and even a few cocktails. I tried the Eggplant Pita and Mushroom Skewer. Both hit the spot and I would order them again, although it was here that I learned the importance of a napkin at the bottom of any Greek street food. Cut to me with sauce all over my trousers- totally worth it!
23 Leoforos Athinas, Athina 105 54
Falafel House is a blink and you’ll miss it takeaway spot that sells well falafel. They’re a fully vegetarian restaurant with a few vegan options. I tried 3 of their wraps, the Mexican, the Original and the Babaganouj. I’m honestly not sure which one was my favourite, but I can say this, deep fried falafel is a game changer.
Next up lets talk pizza and more importantly Peynirli, boat shaped pizza. I can’t explain why but it’s just better boat shaped! Smak offers a few different choices for vegans- truffle, hummus, avocado, and pesto. I had the Truffle (Fresh mushrooms, Vegan cheese, Truffle oil, Garlic and baby spinach) & Pesto (Vegan cheese, San Marzano tomato sauce, Vegan pesto, Cherry tomatoes, Capers) Peynirli. Both were fantastic but if I had to pick I’d say the Truffle just edged it for me, but I am a truffle lover so that’s to be expected.
Themistokleous 43–45, Athina 106 83
Cookoomela were the pioneers for vegan souvlaki in Athens. So it may surprise you to know that I didn’t actually try the Souvlaki (I’m told it’s delicious). I wanted to try a variety of vegan options so from Cookoomela I had the Dakos salad, which is a salad made of rusks, tomatoes, avocado, almond cheese, capers and extra virgin olive oil with a deconstructed lentil soutzoukakia kebab plus extra wedges that were great but definitely not needed! I ordered this through the Wolt app, and I was happy to find out that all the packaging is biodegradable. Actually Athens do pretty well when it comes to plastic free and biodegradable packaging.
Maragkou 19, Glyfada 166 75
Speaking of biodegradable/compostable packaging. On my day trip to Glyfada beach, I followed up my glorious swim in the ocean with a quick lunch from AVIT. I had the mushroom gyros wrap & an iced oat latte- now I’m not very keen on Greek coffee, but the wrap was delicious and super cheap.
Agorakritou 32, Athina 104 46
I didn’t actually visit Treis Laloun until my final night in Athens, which was a shame as they have so much choice I would have loved to sample some more of the menu. This fully vegan restaurant offers dishes such as Caesar salad, fries with cheddar and bacon, chicken free a la creme, carbonara, meatless skepasti, schnitzel, plus so much more. I had the Tarragon & fennel shrimp with wild rice and got to try the seitan steak with mushrooms. The shrimp was potentially my favourite meal in Athens, the sauce was delicious and like nothing I’d had before.
21 Eolou Aghias Irinis Square, Athina 105 51
Lukumades do 1 thing and they do it well- Loukoumades (Greek doughnuts). They have a few vegan options to fill (or cover) your Loukoumades with. These include icing sugar, bitter chocolate, peanut butter, agave syrup, apple pie, and chocolate praline. In the week I was in Athens I went to Lukamedes three times and that still wasn’t enough! I tried, peanut butter with chocolate praline, apple pie and the “Vegano” which is made with chocolate sorbet ice cream, vegan chocolate praline, peanut butter, and almonds.
Patousa 4 near Platia Kaniggos, Athina 106 77
Whilst we’re on the subject of desserts, let me finish this post by talking about Cats & Monsters. This 100% vegan ice cream shop has a variety of delicious flavours that you can enjoy in a cone or cup. They’ve got your classics such as strawberry and chocolate chip as well as some more interesting flavours like pear with feta and apple pie. They also specify the type of plant milk used for each ice cream. I tried strawberry brownie, hazelnut bueno, praline rocher and tiramisu, all delicious- but I think my favourite was bueno, this was one of my favourite chocolates in my pregan( pre vegan) days and I can confirm this was spot on.
Those are the vegan options I checked out during my time in Athens, but there was still a lot more I didn’t get round to trying. Check out Happy Cow for the full list of vegan restaurants in Athens and enjoy your time in Athens, I certainly did!

I don’t think I know of anyone who does not have Greece on their bucket list of places to visit. I’ve long wanted to see it in person.
Part of my “excuse” for visiting Greece was that there is a class tie-in as one of the classes I was taking was Style and Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Of course, the study of rhetoric necessarily involves some discussion of ancient Greece. As it turns out, there was also a link to the history class I am currently taking in that one of the required readings involves torture in Greece following a coup in 1967. Not that I needed an excuse to visit Greece, but hey, it made the decision every so slightly easier.
Nighttime view from the hotel. Not bad at all. Like most tourists, I knew that the Acropolis would need to be on the short list of things to see, but I honestly had no idea it would be this easy to enjoy from the hotel. This was not planned, just a lucky choice when the room was selected online.
Among the surprises on this visit was just how much there is to see without ever leaving the proximity of the Acropolis. Of course, you want to venture out and see more of the city and even get out of Athens and see the rest of Greece. But you could have a rich travel experience without ever going more than a few hundred meters from the Acropolis. In addition to the Parthenon atop the Acropolis itself, there are many other historically-relevant sites that sit alongside the base of the hill. For example, while walking to the Acropolis from my hotel, I passed the Odeon of Pericles, the Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the Stoa of Eumenes, the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, the Sanctuary of Asclepius, and I am sure other significant sites I was not even aware of.
Full disclosure, this was a total vacation, and while I used school as an “excuse” to go to Greece, there was very little by way of study, but still, to see the birthplace of so much of Western Civilization was a fantastic growth experience.
– One of the Greatest Runs of My Life –
One of my favorite ways to learn my way around a new place is to start running. I sometimes have to be careful to pick a significant terrain feature, tall building, or another landmark to use in finding my way back home. Fortunately, for this one, there was the Acropolis. I only had to remember which side was facing my hotel.
I didn’t plan this run out very well, and it was only sheer dumb luck that I happened to be on the western side of the Acropolis just as the sun was rising behind it. This is shown in the featured image that opens this blog post. This view alone made this trip worth the time it took to get here. Most of Athens was soundly sleeping at this time, and I felt as if I had these scenes all to myself.
Agoraphobia — The fear of public spaces. The agora (/ˈæɡərə/; Ancient Greek: ἀγορά agorá) was a central public space in ancient Greek city-states. The literal meaning of the word is “gathering place” or “assembly”. The ancient agora in Athens, with its amazing view of the Acropolis, is not only beautiful, but it is also one of the richest historical sites in Western Civilization. Here is, among other sites, the Temple oh Hephaestus (5th century BCE).
– Amazing things can be built with enough time and dedication –
Most of us have some understanding of the ancient nature of Athens. It is sometimes easy to forget; however, just how old it really is. Ancient Greek civilization starting with the Greek Dark Ages, through antiquity, runs roughly from 1200 BCE up to around 600 CE. So, when we think of ancient Greece, we are not only talking about something long ago, but also something that lasted a long time.
The deep time inherent in Greek civilization allowed for some pretty amazing feats of architecture. Consider the Temple of Olympian Zeus, for example. While visiting this, the largest temple in the ancient world, I couldn’t help but marvel at how people so long ago, without the aid of modern technology, could build something so amazing. It was only later that I learned that construction on this temple began under the Athenian tyrants in the 6th century BCE and was not completed until the 2nd century CE — 638 years after construction began!
Things that I already knew about Greece so not surprising but still interesting: We owe democracy, philosophy, theater, the art of rhetoric, the Olympic games, and some of the world’s most amazing food to Greece. What I didn’t expect to see in Greece? Streets lined with orange trees, marble streets, and the word music, which comes from the Muses, or mythological goddesses of the arts.
As a self-described travel junkie and collector of stamps in my passport, I often avoid going to the same place multiple times, though there are exceptions to this rule. Greece is one of these exceptions and I definitely plan to see it again and more extensively.

I responded to a call about a domestic disturbance and found Oberon, King of the Fairies; the shrewd and knavish sprite Robin Goodfellow (also known to me as Puck); and several members of Oberon’s party engaged in a verbal dispute with Titania, Queen of the Fairies, and several members of her party.
Oberon and Titania accused each other of infidelity. Titania also accused Oberon of ecological extortion. Oberon did not deny the allegations and said his actions were to punish Titania for stealing his henchman, a little changeling boy who was not present.
I contacted Child Protective Services who reported Oberon and Titania are not blood relatives of the child in question, and neither has a legal claim of custody. CPS further informed me the child is currently in India with his biological parents.
I relayed these facts to the disputants and advised them to avoid each other until the situation cools down.
2:10 AM
I responded to calls from an owl, spotted snakes, thorny hedgehogs, newts and blindworms, spiders, beetles, and a snail who complained that fairies were harassing and threatening…

I am the author of the book Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life. I thought I’d share with you all a bit more about who I am and one of the main questions that I’ve been grappling with for years, along with the spirit with which I hope to approach this question and our relationship as writer and reader.
“What hath Athens to do with Jerusalem?” This question was originally asked by Tertullian, a Roman citizen in Carthage, Africa, who lived from 155–240 AD. He started out as a student of Stoicism, the most popular philosophy of his day, and he is now known by some as the father of Western theology.
His question (“What hath Athens to do with Jerusalem?”) was not referring to geographic places. It was referring to the relationship between philosophy (symbolized by Athens) and spirituality (symbolized by Jerusalem), or the relationship between reason and faith; the relationship between those things that we can know with our minds alone, and those that require different modes of knowing — truths which are not accessible to us through reason alone.

I think it was sometime in the fall of 2014 that I found out about a young minister who felt like God wanted him to start a brand new church in Columbus. Being the same age and in the same profession, I was intrigued by his plan. My wife and I had recently felt a similar leading to join a new church in Illinois. Our plan was to learn how to start a church also during an 18 month period since we weren’t sure where we would end up after our church-planting residency. The only question I had for Aaron Lentz when hearing about his plan was, “Why Columbus?”
In some people’s minds, the last thing we need in Columbus is another church. There’s already so many great congregations in our community that currently meet people’s spiritual needs. Don’t we have somewhere between over 100 churches in Bartholomew County? What was pulling Lentz and a group of his friends to start another church in already “saturated Christian market”?
To zoom out for a minute from Columbus, every church was once a brand new church. Some people forget this important fact. For whatever reason, this just escapes people’s brains. The other thing that I think is important for people to understand before we move on is the difference between a church (building) and a church (group of people). I don’t think it’s the time to go into the original meaning of these words in the biblical languages of Greek and Hebrew, but I’ll sum it up this way so we’re all on the same page.
The last thing any community needs is another church (building). Every community can use more churches (groups of people) though.
At the heart of “Why Columbus?” are three reasons that I’ve heard from Lentz each time we have talked.
(The Call, The Need, and The Potential were copied and pasted from www.athenscolumbus.com)
The Call
After seeking the Lord in prayer and asking for discernment, we are certain that Columbus is it! We are trusting that the Lord will bring people to Himself in Columbus and what a humbling privilege it is to be a part of what God is doing in this city to glorify Himself.
The Need
There is a great need for gospel-preaching churches in Columbus. There are 105 churches for the 76,794 residents of Bartholomew County. With the average church reaching approximately 125 people, that means that there is 1 church for every 731 people.
The Potential
With Columbus being the home of a number of internationally known companies such as Cummins Engine Company, individuals from across the globe venture to Columbus to make it their home; God is bringing the nations to Columbus. This church plant will reach beyond the scope of Bartholomew County — it will reach the world! Columbus is an attractive, award-winning city home of architectural sights, a number of resources, and numerous opportunities for employment. These accolades contribute to Columbus’ reputation of being a city of great influence. As Columbus is impacted by the gospel of Jesus, it’s influence will spread to the surrounding cities and beyond! With Columbus being a city of world-renown wonders, an increasing housing market and numerous employment opportunities, Columbus is a place of influence and potential. Athens Church will be the first location of a church-planting movement. It is our desire to see the Great Commission advanced as disciples of Christ are made and more gospel-preaching churches are planted.
Here are 5 reasons I’m excited about the launching of Athens Church this Sunday.
1. Athens Church loves Columbus
When you talk to Lentz, you can tell how much he loves his hometown. He understands the importance of Cummins and diversity to our community. He appreciates the arts and education that make our city so special. He embodies the small town family morals and values that allow our Hoosier town to continue to shine.
While I don’t think it’s easy for anyone to start a new church, many of the group at Athens are from our community. This will allow them to connect with people, places, and businesses that otherwise might take “outsiders” longer time to build relationships with. I’m honestly excited to see how this will translate to community impact and numerical growth. Although numbers aren’t central to Lentz’s mission at Athens, every number has a name and every name matters to God.
2. Athens Church is all about the Capital “C” Church
Sometimes when a new church begins, they make it sound like they are the cool church, or the best church, or the only church in their marketing. When I talk to Lentz, he reiterates over and over how much God is already doing in Columbus. He wants people to know that Athens Church is just another group of people trying to make a positive difference in our community for God.
The last thing he wants is to make it sound like their church is competing with others. Lentz’s hope is that they can partner with other churches to reach more people in our community for God. Athens wants to be another part of Christ’s team in Columbus. (The Capital C Church refers to Jesus Christ’s Church, not one particularly church)
3. Athens Church will reach people who are not already going to a church
One of the cool things about Athens Church is that they are beginning their public worship services at Yes Cinema in Downtown Columbus. After working for a year at a church that met in a local school, I’ve experienced the reality that people who are curious about Christianity will visit a school before coming to a church building. A new church like Athens is going to draw initial attention from people in the community are searching for a place to explore faith.
I also love their idea of renting a public space for church gatherings because the money will go directly back into the community. Athens is generating additional revenue for a local business that offers a mutually beneficial financial situation. It also allows people to not get distracted by how great a building is and instead focus on why they are at the space.
4. Athens Church gives people an opportunity to serve
If a church is beginning with the right motives, they will focus on developing new people in church leadership instead of stealing the experienced veterans from other congregations. I’m really impressed by a few conversations about leadership development at Athens. By starting a new church, people who otherwise would have waited for years to serve get an opportunity to experience it on the front lines each week.
Athens Church also plans on being a church that serves Columbus. This might sound like a “duh” to readers who are a part of church culture but saying it and doing it are two totally different things. I’m looking forward to seeing how Athens plans to be a church of the community that meets local needs.
5. Athens Church is all about Jesus
Jesus Christ is the central figure of the Bible. Therefore, Athens Church believes that he should be the central figure in our lives as well. As a church this is why you might hear them often use the word “Gospel” in everything they do.
The Gospel simply means the good news about Jesus. The good news is that Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection can change anyone’s life. Athens Church wants to see people, our community, and the world awakened to this reality. Perhaps this is why they are starting their first public church gathering on Easter Sunday, the day Christians celebrate Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead.
These are just a few reasons why I’m excited about Athens Church launching this Easter Sunday. My family and I will be attending this Sunday to support my friend and their church as they continue their church-planting journey.
If you would like to join us, Athens Church meets at Yes Cinema (328 Jackson Street) and their worship service starts at 10:30am. If you would like to learn more about Athens Church and my friend Aaron Lentz, check out their website here.

Introduction
The 2000’s have been to Greece what the 60’s were to Northwestern Europe. An era defined by strong growth & debt-financed consumption. Unsustainable. Doom to fail. We’ve all read that Greece suffered a huge blow from the economic crisis. But did know that Athens is also very much alive? With very little money, art and culture flourished in the capital. So much so that it attracted many artists from around the world, spawning a creative exodus in the country.
This dynamic was noticed by the artistic community and brought forth in the fourteenth edition of one of the world’s most ambitious contemporary art exhibitions: documenta. In 2017, for the first time in its history, the German quinquennial was split between Germany and Greece, between Kasse,l its main location, and Athens.
Over the course of 4 months, from exhibitions and events to encounters and friendships, we have permeated Athens’ artistic ecosystem to see this shift in dynamics and surge of creative energy. How to explain this dynamic? By understanding its causes.
From the social, political, economical, cultural and historical standpoints, this immersion has given us a certain picture of ​​Greece’s soul and identity. This creative effervescence cannot be understood without understanding Greece first.
Athens Artlife is a journey into the Greek soul of 2017 through its artistic scene.
Genesis /// Meeting a superstar
A chance, an evening, an encounter, a woman. Ingeborg Beugel. Dutch journalist, war reporter, a cigarette in one hand, glass of wine in the other, we discuss. A family friend, she tells us about Greece, the new life of Athens, the art scene, the influx of international artists, documenta.
She has some perspective. She’s been living in Greece for 30 years. She was married to the right-hand man of singer, actress and former Greek minister of culture Melina Mercouri. She knows the Athenian art scene. She is fascinating, we love her, she invites us to Athens to see for ourselves.
Fascinated by the thought that “less money means more art” we start our research. The New York Times, the BBC, the Guardian, le Monde, they all write about Athens and its new dynamics in arts and culture at large. Searching for a documentary on the subject, we cannot find one. The idea of ​making our own emerges. After 2 months of research, prep and the launch of the non-profit Odyssée Production, we fly to Athens in April 2017.
http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170509-can-athens-become-europes-new-arts-capital
Synopsis & Intention
Life, energy, wisdom and beauty can arise from the worst moment of crisis, doubt and hardship. Athens Artlife is a journey into the contemporary Greek soul through its artistic scene in Spring and Summer of 2017.
Athens Artlife aims at exposing the links between the thriving local art scene and the unshakeable Greek identity through and in spite of national challenges.
Athens Artlife aims at showcasing and promoting the city’s artistic soul and new dynamics.
Athens Artlife wishes to support Greek artists by giving them visibility.

NB. This crowdfunding’s only goal is to ensure that all the depth and beauty of this project can be highlighted and brought into focus in the editing stage so that this film can have the best chances of being recognized at its fair value, promoted widely and shown at festivals.
As all the footages have already been shot, the funds raised will go towards the costs of post-production (camera, editing, calibration), the cost of equipment (cameras, feet, lighting, microphones rented on site), to pay the various Greek aids (cameraman, film editors) and finally, for promotion and its festivals fees (registration costs).
Thanks for your implication, we will be able to get this film out there. You are an integral part of the project. Thanks thanks thanks!

When Athens Held a “Coolest Person” Contest (and the Loser Got Banished),https://medium.com/@funhistory/when-athens-held-a-coolest-person-contest-and-the-loser-got-banished-8552e8846526,"Sign up

Imagine living in a city where every year, the citizens gathered, not to elect their leaders, but to decide who was getting kicked out of town. Sounds like a reality TV show gone wrong? Actually, it was ancient Athenian democracy in action, around the 5th century BC. They called it ostracism, and it was their way of saying, “You know what, maybe you’re too popular for your own good.”
Let’s set the stage. Athens is buzzing. Democracy is the hot new political trend, philosophers are debating in the agora (marketplace), and everyone’s got an opinion — loudly voiced, of course. But with all this freedom and debate, there was a nagging fear: what if someone got too powerful? What if a charismatic leader charmed their way into tyranny, just like in the bad old days before democracy?
Enter ostracism. Think of it as a pressure release valve for Athenian society, a way to prevent any single person from becoming too influential and threatening the democratic balance. Every year, the Athenians would hold a vote. But instead of voting for someone, they voted against someone. Each citizen could write a name on a piece of pottery shard (an ostrakon, hence the name). If a name got enough votes — and “enough” was a hefty number, around 6,000 — that person was ostracized.
Now, here’s the kicker, the part that’s utterly hilarious from our modern perspective: ostracism wasn’t about punishing criminals or banishing enemies. It was about temporarily exiling people who were too successful, too well-liked, or simply too ambitious for the comfort of the democratic crowd. Imagine being so popular you get voted off the island… literally!
Picture the scene: The Athenian Assembly is packed. Citizens are nervously clutching their pottery shards. Whispers fill the air: “Is it Pericles this year? Maybe Cimon? He’s been awfully successful lately…” It’s like the ancient Greek version of the Met Gala red carpet, but instead of fashion critiques, careers are on the line.
And the punishment for being too awesome? Ten years of exile. That’s right, a decade-long timeout for being a bit too good at life. The ostracized individual had to pack their bags and leave Athens, although thankfully, they didn’t lose their property or citizenship. It was more of a “take a break, cool off, and maybe come back less… you.”
From our 21st-century perspective, this is comedy gold. A democratic society banishing people for being too popular? It’s like holding a “Most Likely to Succeed” contest in high school and then expelling the winner. We can almost imagine the ostracized Athenians grumbling as they packed their bags, “Seriously? I get punished for being good at things?”
But behind the humor, there’s a serious point. Ostracism, while seemingly absurd to us, reflects a deep-seated concern in ancient Athens about the dangers of unchecked power and the fragility of democracy. They were so committed to preventing tyranny that they were willing to temporarily sacrifice even their most capable citizens, just to be safe. It’s a drastic measure, born out of a very real fear.
Who was involved? The entire Athenian citizenry, from farmers to philosophers, participated in ostracism. Famous figures like Themistocles and Cimon were ostracized, proving that no one, no matter how accomplished, was immune to the public’s popularity anxieties. How did people react at the time? It was a regular part of Athenian political life, accepted, though probably not always happily, as a necessary safeguard for democracy.
This quirky practice from ancient Athens, while funny from our viewpoint, serves as a potent reminder of the constant balancing act between individual ambition and the collective good. It subtly underscores themes of resilience — the Athenians were constantly innovating to protect their democracy — and critical thinking: what are the potential downsides of even the most well-intentioned systems? And perhaps, it’s a cautionary tale about the fickle nature of popularity and the occasional human tendency to cut down the tallest poppies in the field.
So, next time you feel a pang of jealousy at someone else’s success, remember the ostracized Athenians. It could be worse — at least you’re not getting banished for being too awesome. And maybe, just maybe, it’s a good thing we don’t have popularity-based exile in our modern democracies. Although, thinking about some reality TV stars… just kidding! (mostly).

Travelling from Athens to Ohrid, Macedonia was probably one of the more adventurous backpacking experiences I had. I got on the road unplanned (and without mobile data) except booking a one-way train ticket from Athens to Thessaloniki. Then, I left the rest to the universe! The journey involved two train rides, a taxi ride, a police officer, and a car ride with a complete stranger (!) In this post, I am sharing the travel details of how I got to Ohrid from Athens. You can copy my route, but it might not be your cup of tea.
Pin it to read it later!
Why I wanted to visit Macedonia
The reason may sound funny to you. I heard the name of this small country in the news when I was 11 years old. My country Taiwan donated millions of dollars to Macedonia hoping to build a solid friendship, but all the money went into the pockets of corrupted Macedonian politicians (!) Well, I was 11, so none of the political matters was relevant to me. However, the name of Macedonia did get stuck in the back of my brain because it sounded like macadamia! (Yes, Macadamia, the nuts.)
Besides that, to be honest, I knew nothing about Macedonia except the capital Skopje was the birthplace of Mother Teresa. I wanted to go to Skopje from Athens but realised there wasn’t any direct trains/buses. I couldn’t arrive Macedonia without going through Thessaloniki! My Couchsurfing host in Athens suggested me to go to Ohrid first because it would be a pity to miss it. And I’ve never heard of Ohrid before that afternoon.
From Athens to Thessaloniki
I wanted to hitchhike at first, but my Macedonian host suggested me not to due to the rising crime in kidnapping/human trafficking (if I remember correctly.) I tried getting the train ticket in the morning of, but it was completely sold out, so I ended up travelling a day later. Taking the overnight train saved me a night of accommodation.
It was 2015, the year which thousands of Afghanistan, Syrian, and Iraqi refugees flooded into Europe through Macedonia. Many of them took the same train, and from their outfits and bags, it was quite clear that they weren’t going on a vacation. The train was noisy, packed, and the toilet was smelly, but I ain’t complaining because at least, I still had a seat and there was air conditioning.
I arrived Thessaloniki at dawn and was thinking to stay there for a day or two, but the exhaustion from the overnight ride got me. All I wanted to do was to charge my way to Ohrid. I followed the instruction my host in Athens gave me before I departed and asked the ticket booth for the next train to Florina.
From Thessaloniki to Florina was a smooth ride. The short distance local train was pretty empty in contrast to my last leg. My plan was to find a bus that would bring me to Ohrid, but of course, that idea fell through.
From Florina to Bitola, Macedonia
Florina is a small town at the border of Greece and Macedonia, and the train station was tiny, too. In fact, there wasn’t a “train station.” All I saw was a small blockhouse. I walked in there and asked who I assumed as the ticket agent about how to get to Ohrid, and here came the problem: He could barely understand English, and he has never heard of Ohrid before! At this point, I had already travelled for more than 10 hours.
I walked out and looked around but saw no one besides a taxi driver and a police officer. I walked up and asked about how to get to Ohrid by bus.
“You want to take the bus? It’s in the centre. Very far away,” the police officer said.
Great. I wondered how if there are any other ways I can get to Ohrid. He then exchanged a few words with the taxi driver.
“He can take you to Bitola, 14 euros.” That’s a pretty good deal, I thought to myself. How about Ohrid? I asked. “120 euros.” Hmm, that’s a drastic difference. I guess I’ll go to Bitola first, then figure out the rest.
I tried to make a conversation with the taxi driver, but he didn’t talk much English. When we were crossing the border, he took down his taxi sign and put it in his trunk. I supposed it’s illegal for him to operate as a cab driver in another country. It was miles of nothing on the way to Macedonia. When we finally made it to Bitola, I gave him 20 euros and waited for him to give me my change.
“One more.” He shook the bill I just gave him in his hand.
“Isn’t it fourteen euros?”
“Fourteen! Fourteen! Pen!” Then he took out a piece of paper and wrote: 40.
“Wait, I thought it was four-teen euros! Not for-ty! Can we do thirty instead?” I realised what went wrong here but proposed an alternative. He unwillingly agreed. I couldn’t help to feel bad, but I was on a budget. In the end, he did drive to another country and had to drive back.
From Bitola to Ohrid
There were a few buses parked at where the taxi driver dropped me off. An old man walked up to me and said he could drive me to Ohrid. I knew he wasn’t going to do it for free. I saw another blockhouse-looking building and wanted to see if it’s a ticket booth for the buses, but this one was worse than the one in Florina — It was abandoned with no one inside.
“How much?” I walked back to the old man. “20 euros.” “Okay, let’s go.” I got into his car.
His old stick-shift might be as ancient as him, and it was making squeaky sounds when we were driving. We were going 40km per hour on bumpy, curvy roads with Balkan music blasting through the almost broken radio. Again, I was trying to chat with him to keep myself awake, but that failed also. And there was no way for me to know how long the ride was supposed to take. The ride felt like forever! The man picked up a mid age woman on the road who waved him down when we were closer to Ohrid. It seemed like they knew each other.
Ohrid
After 12+ hours, I finally arrived Ohrid. I didn’t exchange any Macedonian Denars in Greece since I had no idea I would make it to Ohrid the day after. The old man waited for me outside of a currency exchange office and drove off after I gave him the equivalent of 20 euros in MKD. (I only had 100 euros, and he didn’t have any change in euros, of course.)
Where did I stay?
I arrived Ohrid at noon, and it was extremely hot! a few locals approached me and wanted me to stay at their hotels/B&B or whatever it was. I wondered around with my backpack in the city centre and found a hotel lobby that would let me use their free wifi. Then I found The Art Hostel Ohrid via Hostelworld. It was a bit far away from the city centre, but that was okay. I went without a reservation and got myself a bed! They didn’t ask me how many days I wanted to stay, and I received the warmest hospitality!
And that’s the story of how I travelled from Athens to Ohrid.
I travelled 802km and spent a total of 80 euros. It probably wasn’t the cheapest way, but it was an unforgettable experience. And Ohrid is definitely a hidden gem of the Balkans. I had the most pleasurable memories and met some wonderful people there. The town itself deserves its own post, so I’ll save the stunning photos of Ohrid in the next one!
If you like my travel stories, leave a comment and let me know! I would really appreciate that. Also, feel free to subscribe! and follow me on Facebook to stay up to date!

It was only 2 years ago in Athens Greece that the Cubans “barely” walked away with yet another gold medal after a great game with Australia. The seats were full…. and the field was rated the best that players had seen in Europe.
I wonder what happened to the facility? I have been told it is abandoned and scarcely used. Since I have not been back to Greece since the Olympics I have talked to a couple people that have said the stadium is off limits.
Thessaloniki is trying to build a new field. They are looking for donations. Go to www.baseballgreece.com
If Baseball is going to get back in the Olympics again we need to grow the game in Europe. That’s where the IOC members live that booted the game again last week out of the 2012 Olympics.
Time to sound off about Baseball Internationally. Its going to be a great year with the WBC. I will be working the field in San Juan at Hiram Bithorn Stadium for the World Baseball Classic. More to blog about that event.

2023, Athens, GreeceOn the occasion of the celebration of the great slaughter, there was an awakening of our reflexes to a ritual that takes place at regular intervals validating the rules of hierarchy of species where animals are inferior and are species to be exploited.
By striking at butchers we strike at the institutions and laws that wash away crimes but at the same time we highlight how the everyday person, the trader, the customer, etc. also participates in this timeless holocaust.
From this authoritarian mania, people from below do not escape by participating in customs or anti-customs calling themselves anti-authoritarians who contribute to the maintenance of the mass massacre by the domination. Being another proof that the state and power is primarily maintained by those who follow the rules, institutions and laws set by those from above and secondarily by the state and power.
For these reasons we chose as a minimal act of retaliation to strike shops and warehouses of dismembered corpses, conceived as food, because of sadistic anthropocentric culture. We chose to sabotage with simple means such as paint, glue, and leaflets by promoting it to every person who espouses the idea of anti-slavery to act accordingly in the spaces where they move.
Breaking down in practice the structures of control, discipline, and self-monitoring. We propose mass sabotage because anarchy without direct action is incomplete.
Authoritarians of all forms will find us before you.

Ancient Athens was a center for the arts, learning, and philosophy, the home of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum, Athens was also the Birthplace of Socrates, Plato, Pericles, Aristophanes, Sophocles, and many other well-known philosophers, writers, and politicians of ancient Greece. It is widely referred to as the Cradle of Democracy, and Western Civilization mainly due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC on the then-European Continent.
Pericles (495–429 BCE), came from an illustrious aristocratic family and was an Athenian statesman, general, orator, and arts patron. He was Pivotal in the development of Athenian democracy and the Athenian empire.
He helped establish democracy in Athens and is considered the first citizen of a democratic Athens. He transformed its alliances into an empire. Rebuild the Acropolis after it was destroyed by the Persian invasion. And many more.
He believed in the wisdom of the goddess Athena, the guiding spirit of Athens. And lived by his rational ideologies

Athens, the historical and cultural capital of Greece, is a city steeped in history located on the shores of the Aegean Sea. Known as the birthplace of ancient Greek civilization, this city exudes an atmosphere filled with history at every corner. On my recent trip, I embarked on a journey to explore Athens, and I couldn’t help but be enchanted by this unique experience.
Journey to the Acropolis:
Upon arriving in Athens, my first stop was, of course, the Acropolis. This ancient citadel, a symbol of Greece, is perched atop a high hill and greets visitors with the splendor of the Parthenon Temple. As I ascended to the Acropolis, walking among the historical ruins, I felt the excitement of traversing through time. Rediscovering the captivating beauty of the ancient era against the backdrop of the city’s panoramic views filled me with profound admiration.
Plaka District:
Descending from the Acropolis, I visited the heart of the city, known as the Plaka District. With its narrow cobblestone streets, colorful shops, and traditional taverns, Plaka is one of the liveliest and most charming neighborhoods in Athens. Here, while savoring local delicacies, I found myself immersed in a unique blend of ancient and modern atmospheres.
Ancient Agora and Old Town:
To delve deeper into Athens’ historical fabric, I made my way to the Ancient Agora. This was the place where philosophers like Socrates and Plato once walked. Roaming among the ruins of the Agora felt like embarking on a journey through the past. Afterwards, getting lost in the narrow streets of the Old Town and wandering among the traditional houses made me feel as if time stood still.
Modern Athens:
Athens not only boasts the legacy of ancient times but also thrives as a modern city. Central points like Monastiraki Square and Syntagma Square are lined with modern cafes, restaurants, and shopping centers. Exploring these areas allowed me to discover the modern and dynamic side of the city.
As I strolled through the streets of Athens, I savored the experience of exploring a city intertwined with history. Following the footsteps of ancient Greek civilization while experiencing the vibrant atmosphere of a modern capital was an unforgettable experience. Athens was not just a trip for me; it was a journey through time. A bridge between the past and the future was built before my eyes, and this experience will forever leave a lasting impression on me.

What makes a civilization great? A civilization achieves greatness when various facets of humanity — physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual — are allowed to blossom and find full expression.
When you look at the ruins of Athens, you see evidence of this greatness.
Many impressive cities in history have made great contributions to the growth of human civilization, but few have come close to what Athens came to achieve and represent. When I visited the city I found the testament of its greatness written in stones; in its broken columns and fallen walls.
As you reach Athens, you see its skyline dominated by a cluster of massive structures on a hilltop. These were magnificent temples, now only ruins, which towered over the city in its glorious days.
The most impressive among the structures is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Goddess Athena. Its imposing columns striving to kiss the sky stir within one the ever-present yearning to transcend our earthly limits and reach for something beyond.
For a moment transport yourself to ancient Athens and observe the Athenians doing their everyday, mundane chores; haggling over the price of wheat in the market, herding their sheep to olive gardens, plotting a…

What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.
— Attributed to Pericles, 5th Century BCE
Ancient Athens is often referred to as the birthplace of Western thought. Whilst we have a lot to thank the Athenians for in terms of the invention of education as we know it, critical thinking, science, democracy, technology and architecture, everyday life looked a lot different back then. There were vast inequalities depending on gender, political and economic standing, for one only free men were classed as citizens, with females and slaves living a much more restrictive life.
In this article, we’ll delve into what life would have looked like as an inhabitant of Athens, in terms of their occupation; diet; how they socialised; where they lived and what family life looked like.
Athens, as a thriving and bustling coastal city boasted a vast array of different occupations of all skill sets and familial backgrounds. From high ranking jobs in the military, philosophical tutors, local government officials to the less well paying jobs such as fishing, farming and everything in between. Many made their living through the marketplace- the…

Matt D. Smith is the owner and Design Director at Studio Mds, a small independent design studio in Athens, GA. He created the Float Label Pattern for digital form input fields, which is now a design standard in Google’s Material Design Guidelines. He’s a proud father of four and has led creative work for agencies and brands in the US and Singapore including NBC, AT&T, Sprint, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Dwell, Razorfish, Sapient and more.
When your friends or parents ask to you what job do you do, how do you answer?
I tell them I’m a designer and work mostly on websites and mobile apps. Everyone knows what those things are so this answer proves most digestible for a layman.
What is your background, how did you train?
I was always drawing when I was a kid. In college I gravitated towards drawing and painting and eventually made my way into the Graphic Design department at the University of Georgia. There I learned a lot of the fundamentals of design–typography, white space, color, contrast, etc. After graduating I got heavily involved in the Flash community and taught myself Actionscript 2.0. This sparked my passion for digital design.
What the web can do to make this world a better place? How did the web improve your life( if it did)?
The web can’t do anything on its own–it needs people. It’s a powerful tool to connect humans all over the world around a specific thing. The possibilities are endless.
Can you show us three examples of interface that in your opinion improved human life?
“Improving human life” is definitely subjective depending on whom you ask. I’d say a few that make my life easier are iMessage, Fantastical, and Dropbox. iMessage for short specific bursts of communication. Fantastical for its natural language input to create events. And finally, Dropbox that reliably keeps all of my digital stuff wherever I go.
On quora.com, time ago there was a long discussion in answer to the question “what is the most intuitive interface ever created?”; according to Felipe Rocha it is the nipple, in your opinion instead? (http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-intuitive-interfaces-ever-created)
Hmm, maybe fruit. It appeals to most of your senses–sight, smell, feel, taste. It serves a core human need, hunger. It’s also nutritious. =)
How is your work day type?
I get into work around 8 AM and try to write first thing in the morning before email, jumping into design, or anything else. From then on until around 5pm, it’s design, emails, etc. all day.
What is the most stimulating and challenging project you have accomplished?
The most challenging project I’ve worked on so far has been Shiplify, a commercial transportation management system. There are huge amounts of information along with the constraint of a mobile device that really leveled up my thinking and skills.
What is, among the existing digital services, the one you wanted to do?
Hah, I’m still trying to figure that out.
Many designers commit the mistake of starting a project directly from Photoshop, is there a perfect design method? What is your approach to the creative process?
Starting in Photoshop is a good way to create art, but not solve a problem. The more experience I gain as a designer, the more time I wait before jumping into a design. I start with lots and lots of questions about the problem we’re trying to solve and why.
The “design” is an important part of our analogic life. What is the role of the designer in our digital life?
The core role of the designer hasn’t changed much from analog to digital. It remains to communicate visually. The trick is to find out what you’re trying to communicate and why.
Do you believe it is important for a designer to have a deep knowledge of matters as User Experience, Interaction Design, Product Design, and Front-end development?
It depends on what the designer wants to do with her personal career, but I if she wants to be the best she can possibly be, she’ll need to have a relentless pursuit of knowledge of her craft. Learning to code, etc. will only help her connect dots easier and gain a better understanding of digital products overall.
In which way do you make a difference between User Interface and user experience?
The UX is the design in its entirety– the alpha and the omega. From the words on the very first entry screen, to a payment receipt sent via email, UX covers it all. It is holistic, from business strategy to behavioral design. The UI is a smaller portion of the broader picture that deals specifically with the parts people touch and click. The two are deeply intertwined and should be considered in parallel. Sometimes UX decisions can be enhanced by UI design and vice versa. The best UI designers will also be great UX designers. I’m not a big fan of segmenting the titles of UX and UI designer, which is why I call myself simply a designer. I do both.
What is your relationship with the developers? There are people that have a relationship of continuous confrontation and other of deep friendship, where do you collocate with respect to this question?
If you want to work well with others, there needs to be friendship and common ground. If you find yourself constantly at odds with developers or anyone else for that matter, you’re doing it wrong. There’s a degree of humility that needs to be present for people to work together harmoniously.
How do you think that your career and job will evolve in the next 5 years?
I’ll always design things. It’s my thing, ya know? With that said, I do see myself transitioning to more strategy, planning, and writing to build my own products as opposed to only doing client work.
A famous quotation of David Carson (noted American graphic designer) says: “Graphic design will save the world right after rock and roll does”.Will the User Interface Design save the world, before, at the same time, or after the graphic design?
After. UI is no savior.
What do you think about Dribbble? Is it a good way to get a job? What’s the best way to find a job as designer?
Dribbble is amazing. I’ve met great people there and it’s delivered lots of job opportunities. People often mention Dribbble as a place where people focus on shallow design and getting likes, but that’s not Dribbble’s fault, that’s people’s fault. Look at Facebook, it’s an amazing communication tool, but it becomes mind-numbing after too much exposure–not because of the software, because of the content.
Dribbble is what you make it.
What book would you advice to a Junior Designer?
Hmm, that’s tough. There are so many great books; my suggestion would be to read constantly. There isn’t a magic bullet. You have to progress gradually. One book that I’m really enjoying at the moment is Peter Thiel’s, “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future”
Always as far as advices: what tools for the design?
Beyond wireframes, I’ve become a big Sketch fanatic for UI design. I still use Photoshop regularly for different things, but Sketch is now my goto for layout out UI for a website or an app.
What tools for the projects management?
For wireframing, I swear by Adobe Illustrator. I’ve tried out most software for this purpose and Illustrator is by far the fastest and most versatile vector editor there is. In fact, I’ve created a whole blog series devoted to rapid UX design with Adobe Illustrator, which can be found at http://aiux.co

In 1867 Matthew Arnold wrote a book titled Culture and Anarchy in which he held up two saving springs of our civilization: Athens — from which we get the inner urge to “see things as they really are” — and Jerusalem, from which we get the directive “to set doing above knowing.”
I don’t know if I would draw the contrast between these two civilizational sources in the terms that Arnold used. But I do know that, in studying, teaching and loving philosophy as I do, while at the same time feeling myself to be Jewish at my self’s core, I must in some sense resemble the human type that Arnold was talking about.
On my last day of teaching at Brooklyn College, I passed around the attendance sheet for the Intro course and later found that the students had penned their own farewells. Since those attendance sheets now hang in my study, I can quote a line or two: “I am sure that, speaking for everybody, you touched many minds and lives. Thank you for portraying philosophy in such a user-friendly way …” or again, “Just know that you made a difference in many peoples’ lives, especially mine.”
It’s in the light of recent developments on university campuses that I’ve cast this backward glance over the terrain of my working life. What did it feel like to me, to work in the precincts of the academy — the House that Plato Built? What did it mean to me, teaching philosophy to students at Brooklyn College — that is, to young people from all over the world? My graduate school teacher of philosophy, the Straussian Stanley Rosen, described it as the disclosure of “beautiful and sacred things.” I remember Leo Bronstein — who was a celebrated teacher of art history at Brandeis — marveling, in his Russian/Catalan accents, that “the kids are forced, fo-r-r-rced (!) to learn sublime matters!”
In my turn, I viewed teaching philosophy as the transmission of a civilizational power and presence. If it was an Intro course, I would make the case for the importance to each of them of this transmission. “This will help you to decode the life you will face. It’s not true that you are what you eat. You are what you think! When you notice the way people behave, the way they frame their challenges, and the reasons or rationales they reference in explaining their decisions — you will be better able to lift out the thinking that lies back of all that.”
Sometimes I referred to the saying of Socrates that the unexamined [i.e. philosophically unsituated] life is not worth living. He meant, you’re not making the best use you can of your time here if you can’t identify and make good use of its philosophic assumptions. It’s not about choosing the “best philosophy” to live and steer by. They all have limitations or shortcomings, as does any attempt to understand a topic. No topic can be plumbed to every depth conceivable. But to know how to get to the available depths and to plumb that is a great power — empowering in the best sense — provided that (as with any power) it’s not used for harm.
So much for recalling what it was like for me to teach philosophy to real students. That said, we can fast forward to the present. What is it like to perceive young people who wear the name of “student” but mask their faces, menacing fellow students and teachers, injuring the working people who keep their academic classrooms and buildings functional? To what can I compare the predicament of a real teacher facing such defilements? Perhaps to the situation of a farmer whose field has been sown with salt and rendered barren by those means?
And what would I say to the so-called students who seem to relish doing precisely that kind of harm? If you attack the precincts of learning and teaching, you desecrate your own ability to learn or later to teach what you learned. You will still be able to be indoctrinated, and to indoctrinate others, but you can’t learn and you can no longer teach what you learned. And it’s not merely self-harm that you inflict. You injure your city, your country, your civilization. The wound you inflict has concentric circles of wounds that lie all round it.
And as for me, I wouldn’t know how to cure such wounds. Whatever healing modalities I possess — they don’t stretch that far.
At present, I have yet to reroute my life so that the powers I’ve acquired have some further riverbed channel down which to flow. I can’t just stand at the river’s edge and forever shed tears for what’s been lost.

Hypatia and her revival in Raphael’s School of Athens.,https://medium.com/@sbashllari/hypatia-and-her-revival-in-raphaelos-school-of-athens-7863799c7c80,"Sign up

The renowned masterpiece “The School of Athens” by Raphael captivates viewers with its iconic central portrayal of Aristotle and Plato, gesturing downwards and upwards, respectively. The canvas is a tapestry of intellectual luminaries, featuring figures like Heraclitus in a crouched pose beside a sturdy marble cube, and the revered Socrates and Pythagoras. The room is further enriched by the commanding presence of two statues in the corners — Apollo, the god of light and music, gracefully holding a lyre, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom (or her Roman counterpart, Minerva). Intricately weaving together the threads of knowledge, Raphael’s brushstrokes breathe life into the embodiment of wisdom.
As aptly articulated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Raphael paints wisdom.”
However, there is a lesser known ( and more disputed — arguably the most interesting) figure, dressed all in white, almost set apart from the rest of the painting and looking straight at us, as if Raphael was inviting the viewer to look more closely at this figure in his crowd of mental giants. This figure is often noted as Francesco Maria della Rovere, duke of Urbino (1490–1538). However important being a condottiero might have been, it seems that this particular persona would be a misfit in the room of eternal wisdom. Others argue that the feminine presence of this figure is indisputable, and that figure is in fact Hypatia of Alexandria, a Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, long forgotten and being revived by Raphael.
Hypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator, and best known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy’s Almagest (treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths). As noted, her philosophy was Neoplatonist and was thus seen as “pagan” at a time of bitter religious conflict between Christians (both orthodox and “heretical”), Jews, and pagans. Following the accession of Cyril to the bishopric of Alexandria, Hypatia’s fate suffered a brutal death.
“They dragged her into a building known as the Kaisarion, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using ostraka, which can either be translated as “roof tiles” or “oyster shells”. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire Unfortunately, all Hypatia’s work is lost except for its titles and some references to it by some of her students, reconstructing thus her contribution.”¹
However, back to Raphael’s painting — how can we know that is truly a woman being depicted there when the very figure of Hypatia was emblematic of heresy in the circle of the church ?
“At the same period, there was a common practice artists used, Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo each sketched full-sized cartoons of their large murals on the paper and pricked tiny holes along the contours. They then would blow charcoal through tiny holes onto the walls beneath. Each charcoal “sketch” blown onto the wall would lay the figured groundwork for the intricate painting that followed. When the mural was complete, the cartoons themselves would often be destroyed.”²
However, luckily, Raphael’s complete cartoon for School of Athens has survived and is considered “the most remarkable object of its kind surviving from the Renaissance”. In the cartoon, in a roomful of men, there is only one figure wearing a veil, a classic and common article of clothing used in depicting women in Renaissance paintings. The same veil is not present in the final painting — given that most final works needed somehow the approval of the ruling caste.
In fact, The School of Athens is part of a much larger masterwork, representing only one wall of the most brilliantly illustrated room in history — the Stanza della Segnatura, one of “Raphael’s Rooms” in the Papal Palace of the Vatican. For the first two centuries after it was created, this stanza, a private library to the popes and was only seen by the eyes of the few elite elders in the heart of the Vatican Church.

It takes place in silence, mainly as the people who are supposed to safeguard it remain too preoccupied to see what’s going on.
And that is the bitter lesson of Ancient Athens. Now America is suffering from the same blind spots.
It’s history repeating itself and rhyming with a harsh cadence.
Here’s why two democracies, old and new, might be more alike than we realize.
Athens made something radical: a body of language nobody on this planet had ever seen or heard.. government of the people, by the people.
Voting assemblies. Citizen juries. Laws that treated everybody the same, that is, at least if you were male and free.
By today’s standards it was not fair but it was a beginning.
Like America’s beginning wasn’t perfect — but it was constructed to get better.
Both systems were built on faith as much as bricks.. after people stopped caring, everything wobbled.
Lowerclass Athenians were given a voice by Pericles, who paid them to serve. That widened access.
But what it opened is the door to louder voices, not smarter ones.
As the conversation of leaders descended the crowd was humored.
Applause lines started wars. Justice was about winning a popularity contest.
It was all spectacle. And spectacle requires a villain.
America’s founders were obsessed with history.
They saw what had gone wrong in Athens and tried to slow things down through checks, balances and staggered elections.
The system functioned when people believed in it.
And now the crack is beginning to show in the walls.. Rules that are not violated but rejected.
There’s a rhythm to the drift of democracies. The lyrics are different, but the chorus strikes the same chords.
Athenian Breakdown
American Parallel
These are not symptoms in isolation. They’re a trendline.
Although this time around Athens surrendered to oligarchs after losing a war.
The Thirty Tyrants ruled brutal and short-lived, but that’s all.
The people fought back. Democracy returned.
But it limped.. not marched. What came back wasn’t what it was.
Athens was then given a second chance. It simply wasn’t strong enough for them.
There aren’t any mobs storming the assembly with swords.
No decrees, no coups..just slowbmotion neglect.
Democracy crumbles not when buildings fall in one big blow but when cracks are left unfixed.
And the tools to repair it aren’t glamorous. They’re tedious. Uncelebrated. Necessary.
Athens didn’t fail because it was flawed.
It dropped because too many trusted that it wouldn’t.
America has its warnings. They’re loud.
The resolution depends on whether we are listening to them or are the ones scrolling past.

Review of The Dave Red Athens — April 2025
Check-in was smooth, especially considering my name has a special character and often gets misspelled —I checked in online - No hassle this time, Plus points — which was a nice start. The hotel was clean and looked freshly presented, but there are some serious downsides you should know about before booking. Totally outside the control of the Dave hotel !
There is a hidden door in the ground floor library, You open it to a store room and a stain well come oncome on -dave red guys- like it a Bar.
The hotel is only a few hundred metres from Omonoia Metro Station, but walking those few hundred metres feels like crossing a dystopian wasteland. Junkies and people clearly struggling with addiction are everywhere — shooting up in doorways, passed out on the pavement, or stumbling around in a daze. One man ahead of me was swinging a syringe around like it was a cigarette, in broad daylight. I didn’t feel directly threatened, but the general atmosphere was intense and unpleasant.
You also see severely unwell women loitering — prostitutes— in what looks like a desperate state. Some stood motionless at corners like statues, others circled the same block over and over. It was deeply sad. The whole area feels forgotten and unsafe. If you’re not used to this kind of street scene, it’s genuinely shocking.
The room was fine in terms of cleanliness, but definitely unfinished. It had a clean, modern look — no carpets, just polished flooring — but the detailing wasn’t great. The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain.
The major issue was the shower: it simply doesn’t drain. I’ve worked in construction and can say with confidence — the floor of the shower area has no angle, no lip, and no waterproof tilting detail. It’s just a flat surface, of latex paint so the water spreads quickly across the bathroom floor. After five minutes of showering, you’ll find yourself standing in a puddle with water edging toward the bedroom. A proper fix would involve cutting a groove or sloping the floor slightly toward the drain — basic stuff that just wasn’t done.
Breakfast at The Dave red left a lot to be desired. Compared to nearby options — for example, The Stanley Hotel just around the corner — it was dismal. The Stanley offers a proper buffet with a rotating toaster, beautiful sour cherry syrup,for your Greek yoghurt, fried bacon, tiny sausages, scrambled eggs, and a few other hot items. The Dave, by contrast, felt like a bit of a cost-cutter.
They had boiled eggs, but no scrambled eggs — maybe because that would’ve required just a bit more effort. Overall, it gave the impression of trying to appear trendy while quietly cutting corners. if it cn be wheeled out of a room that what we got
The breakfast room is nicely styled, but it’s let down by the details. The felt on the pool table is shredded, the plumbing is noisy and should of only int the breakfast room be covered up (you can hear when someone above flushes), and coffee is served in paper cups — . On my first morning, I managed to get a proper mug, but by the second, it was back to takeaway cups. For a breakfast I had to pay extra for, it felt more like a quick hostel setup than a hotel experience.
The Dave red clearly leans into quirky style — and to be fair, it succeeds in that. The building used to be the Communist Party headquarters of Greece, and I really think they should lean into that history more. There’s a massive mural in the breakfast room, but no real explanation or story told about the building’s past. That would’ve been a cool addition — Athens has history at every corner, and this building has a unique one.
The Dave is trying to be hip and alternative — and inside, it mostly succeeds. But the location is grim and the construction quality isn’t there yet. If you’re familiar with Athens and know what to expect, you might manage. But for most travellers, especially first-timers, I’d strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Safer, better alternatives: try Psiri, Koukaki, or Plaka — all still central, with far more charm and far fewer needles.
Bottom line: cool hotel, bad street, broken shower. staying in the Plaka next time.

On the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, in Southeast Europe, is the nation of Greece. It is renowned for its illustrious past, vibrant present, and iconic locations including the Acropolis in Athens, the Palace of Knossos in Crete, and the historic settlement of Delphi. Greece is renowned for its mouthwatering cuisine, which includes meals like moussaka and souvlaki, as well as its stunning islands, like Santorini and Mykonos. Greece has Greek as its official language, and it is a parliamentary republic, and the currency used is the Euro.
In the Attica region of Greece, Athens, the country’s capital and largest city, is home to more than 3 million people. With a history that dates back more than 3,000 years, Athens is one of the oldest towns in all of Europe.
The Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Ancient Agora are just a few of the famous sites that can be seen there. It is noted for its rich cultural heritage. Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates are just a few of the philosophers and well-known thinkers from antiquity who were born and raised in Athens.
Numerous institutions, including the National Archaeological Museum and Acropolis Museum, are also located in the city. Athens is a contemporary city with a thriving arts and entertainment…

Fofi: I have been heavily involved in the music industry for the past 25+ years as a DJ, radio producer, consultant and music journalist in various media outlets, specializing in electronic music. I started DJing professionally when I was 16, so I experienced the difficulties that a girl had first hand, trying to make it in a (local) man-dominated industry, needless to say female DJs were a scarcity at the time — it was so difficult to find a role model to be inspired by, look up to, reassure in some way that there was a future, a possibility for a career out there for me. I had to work extremely hard, rely only on myself, constantly prove that I deserve to be there, belong there over and over (and maybe still do today), until I finally got to a point of being able to exclusively live by my profession.
Greece is quite behind in matters of equality, so at some point I decided that I had to give back, I did not want other people and especially girls having to go through what I went through to get somewhere. So, I created HER project. It was a very lonely ride at first, but luckily I met Virginia at a HER party. I detected her drive, our common values and ethos, which led me to decide to invite her on board. With HER project and our trajectory in music as starting points, we were more than excited to launch the Athenian chapter of shesaid.so in April 2020, elevating our initiatives and efforts on a wider and larger scale, belonging to a like-minded larger and international community.
Virginia: I started DJing and producing quite recently, my journey began in 2018 though I did listen to electronic music before that. One night I met Fofi at a HER party, where we discussed about the concept of HER as a female empowerment initiative in music. I immediately resonated with it, because I had experienced gender biased inequality and sexism from one of my mentors. HER felt like a safe outlet to me, and the fact that I am able to utilize my art to offer a safer space to minorities and do something good for our society is the utmost purpose. From then on I joined HER and along with Fofi we are trying to involve more and more women into it, and raise awareness locally. Until now there isn’t a similar initiative as HER in Greece, neither in electronic music nor in other genres. This is why we also initiated shesaid.so Athens, to reach out to the music industry cluster in general, including other genres and professionals beyond artists only.
We regularly collaborate with Athens Pride, both as representatives of gender minorities, but also as members of the LGBTQI+ community. We are always on the lookout for new, inclusive collaborations. World Pride House in Malmo had an open call for proposals, and we decided to sent in a triptych, which included a livestreamed HER DJ set along with drag performances, a live HER DJ set with VRGN, and a very interesting panel discussion on gender equality in the music industry. We were extremely happy that all of them passed. At the discussion, we are hosting 3 brilliant speakers, event planner and curator, Mirca Lotz, from Germany, psychologist and gender equality advisor, Maria Rodriguez, from Spain and Dina Liberg of shesaid.so Sweden, all of whom gave us their own valuable perspectives on current issues and future actions we could all take.
The Greek scene is buzzing — Athens is becoming a very interesting and intriguing art hub, which has been characterized as the “new Berlin”. However, the music ecosystem, as a whole, is light years away from the Berlin scene. Starting from the lack of basic state support and funds, legislations, unions, statistics, lack of professions such as artist managers, music marketers and communicators, label management, agencies, and more. Needless to say, the music industry is still not as equal and inclusive as it should be with minorities. It was only recently that the issue was even a matter of discussion — shesaid.so Athens organized the FIRST panel that addressed the subject in September 2020.
Representation of women is still not enough and the arguments range from “there aren’t enough women musicians to begin with”, “there is no equality problem, women are the ones who do not want a career in music”, to “currently the top DJs are women, so there is no need for gender equality initiatives” and more.
Greece lacks basic education on what gender stereotypes are, on what ways gender inequality appears, what actions, comments and behaviors spark inequality. It is really funny, until it was not anymore, there are many times that as HER project we have felt that we have to actually convince people here that there is a problem with equality in music.
At the same time, Greece is experiencing a huge societal crisis with a constant and very alarming rise in femicides and gender violence, especially during the pandemic, while the patriarchal system is still strong in our society. Therefore, gender initiatives are needed more than ever, and that does not apply only to music.
On a positive note, more and more people speak up, more women and minorities express their own experiences and there is less fear in sharing one’s own story. In In that sense and in order to shed light on the matter of equality in music, in early 2021 we started a video series called #HERwords, where we invite women DJs and producers to answer a few questions in a 5’ video, sharing their own experiences and advice.
Last but not least, in 2021 the #MeToo movement also made its “debut” in the country — it created a sense of shock in the general public, but at the same time it gave a tremendous feeling of strength, support and hope not only to the victims, who boldly went public with their stories, but also to women and gender minorities in general.
What we have noticed from our collaborations with international artists and professionals, as well as members of the shesaid.so community, is that even though the needs are the same, each country and region has a very different perspective in terms of equality in the music industry, and consequently the respective actions each one takes lead to different sets of milestones we need to reach, so as to achieve working in a safer scene.
Everything begins and ends with education in our opinion. Firstly, we need research and statistics — numbers to show what is really happening in each area and profession, to understand each society and then to set up a localized approach and a clear strategy based on local needs and current social situations.
Raising awareness is also a great starting point, by simply advocating for gender equality and sharing experiences. Digital outlets, like social media, have much power that we can all exploit in that sense. Storytelling has become so much easier now, and if one’s story can affect and change just one more person, then it can create a snowball effect. E.g. Rebekah’s #ForTheMusic campaign sparked discussions and gained followers ranging from artists, to promoters, to clubbers and more. This demonstrated a suppressed need, which surfaced and engaged several professionals in the industry, even though it was a bit strange that it took so long for it to happen — since it was a subject we were all discussing constantly behind the scenes -, but thank the Universe it finally did.
Taking this as a starting point and using the Morillo extremely sad incident as an example, we have to really think why it took so long for mouths to open, even though it was made clear that people knew, why we saw so many people standing by him and not the victims, in the first place, but also after his death. This has to change. We need to start talking more and on a wide scale about safe dancefloors and booths, we need more men allies. We know the problem, we need viable solutions.
Finally, actively supporting communities is also an action we can all take in our daily lives. It is not enough to remain impartial anymore. In order to improve the music industry we need to radically change our daily habits, behaviors, collaborations — we need to actively include minorities in shows, we need to actively protect them and support them, until there is no need to do so anymore.
Fofi: I am an introvert, but very skilled at socializing. Music has always been the means to express my feelings through sound, vibrations and words. I have been doing this since I can remember myself, so it was extremely difficult for me to accept that new “normality”. I hold the longest-living residency at a club in the country, being the resident of Sodade2 for the past 21 years, so I did not only lose my outlet for communication, but also my coexistence with my friends and chosen family. I cannot pick one set as my favourite, I am blessed to have had so many. My latest favourite ones are the b2b sets by me and Virginia at Sodade, when after 4 am we usually set the club on fire, but also our performance as HER project at the first Sonar Athens.
Virginia: What I love about performing live is this non-verbal vibe exchange with the crowd, a give and take, while they are trusting us and letting loose to our music. We have had some of our best nights at a local club where Fofi resides, called Sodade, where we play for hours and experiment with house, electro and techno tracks, mixing genres and classic tracks, too. Also, our set at Sonar Athens is one that I will never forget! The stage, the people, the music, the honor of being part of Sonar, it was truly a night I will never forget.
Virginia: I simply won’t do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable, disrespected, insulted, dehumanized. There is an inner voice, I believe we all have, that reminds us of who we are and warns us when we are about to compromise that. I lately listen to this voice more and more, and it tells me that I am enough for those who respect and enjoy what I have to give, and I would never compromise my values and dignity for anything further.
Fofi: Music is my life, so the way I approach music and my career is actually the way I carry myself in this world: with the utmost care and respect.
The fact that we belong to this amazing global network that consists of exceptional people changing the game in the music industry, coexisting with extraordinary, talented, vigorous, dynamic and driven people, sharing the same mindset and ethos is actually a pure privilege and gift. shesaid.so is shaping the future that transcends the music industry and we want to help in that with all our being.
Virginia: I would pick “Rub” by Peaches. Peaches has been one of my favorite artists since I was young. As a woman, listening to an artist like Peaches, her strength, her expression, her I-dont-give-a-f*ckness, has been truly inspirational. Rub specifically, was published in 2015. It has brilliant lyrics, which are an ode to what is (still) happening today. I would absolutely love to have contributed with techno versions, distortions and beats.
Fofi: “Lifeforms” by Future Sound Of London. I consider it a pure piece of art, a pivotal moment in the electronic music history that shaped the things to come. I think that listening to it, when it was released, I could actually feel my brain being reprogrammed to another dimension. The way they stretched genres and combined ambient with techno is phenomenal. Plus, if I was a part of it, I would actually be in the studio with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and then die of awe silently and peacefully at the corner.
Fofi aka Fo is a leading figure in the Greek dance music scene. She has played at all major clubs in the country, shared the decks with several international DJs and she holds the longest living residency at a club in the country, being a resident of Sodade2 BackStage for the past 20 years.
Brimming with curiosity and passion for electronic music, Virginia aka VRGN is an upcoming talent to watch. Within 2 years she has already played in some of the biggest venues in the Greek scene, sharing the decks with both Greek DJs and international ones such and also performed at the first edition of Sónar festival in Athens, in a B2B session with Fo.

There’s nothing like the open road. Possibilities unfold as the terrain whizzes by your window.
Hailing from the second largest country in the world means that road trips were a rite of passage. There’s a lot of ground to cover in Canada. Packing up and jumping in the car for a long drive to a different destination, through ever-changing seasons is a core memory for me. Driving several hours or even days means that I’ve logged a lot of kilometers on Canadian roads over the years — traversing those expansive landscapes with awe. These road trips stretched into married life for family gatherings, special events, school holidays, and glorious weekends at the cottage.
Our road trips took on a whole new dimension when we moved to Izmir, Türkiye in 2021. The roads no longer looked familiar. We drove with a sense of uncertainty and with, I must say, a slight feeling of trepidation.
Can traffic circle procedures really be that different here? Why is everyone speeding? Will small country lanes based on centuries old trails be wide enough to pass through? What if we get lost and we don’t speak Turkish?
Once we adjusted to the local norms of driving we revelled in the fact that our road…

Hello! I am Panagis Sarantos and this is the story of how the GDSC program and Harokopio University of Athens met each other for the first time — and it was quite a journey!
It all started in the summer of 2021 when I was chosen as Lead. It all happened thanks to Angelika Zaucha, community manager for the GDSC program in Europe.
Here’s an interesting story!
It was the summer of 2021. I was hanging out with my friends on a nice evening in the beautiful city of Athens in Neo Iraklio. While we were talking about our summer plans, I got a notification about a new email. I looked it up and saw the name “Angelika Zaucha” for the first time. She reached me via her personal email to ask me if I would accept the lead position because it was the last day to do that, and they did not get the response from my side.I was positively surprised. I rushed out and found all the other emails that had gone to the spam folder. I finalized the paperwork and became the GDSC Lead & Founder of Harokopio University of Athens (GDSC HUA).So… Thank you, Angelika!
First task, of course, was to form our Core Team. As a student of software engineering, I knew I could reach many developers and people in tech. But I also knew that our Club will need others to help with communications, planning and social media. After making my choice, I came up with these few useful tips on selecting core team members:
I have to say that I didn’t follow all the steps that I mentioned above, but now I know better and you should too.
It’s also important to establish a good relationship with your university and the faculty. Introduce yourself and the program to the authorities. We managed to do it, and our university fully supported all our plans and initiatives. At times it was difficult because of the pandemic, but we managed to overcome any obstacles. For example we managed to do a virtual event about AI & Blockchain for more than 260 unique viewers!
Yes, that’s right. Our first virtual event themed as “Applications of AI & Blockchain in Society & Industry” managed to hit more than 260 unique viewers. I have to tell you that I was really nervous at the beginning. We were live streaming on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms. We had guests from the industry and academia. It was quite a big hit and a pretty good experience for me personally as I got to work on my communication and public speaking skills. I’m always nervous making speeches, especially in front of a big audience. This time, I managed to overcome my fears and really learn a lot.
Solution Challenge, organized yearly by Google Developer Student Clubs, was something I knew I wanted to join right from the start, either by myself or with other members of our chapter.I felt that rush of excitement when I was watching the Top 10 chapters of 2021. I loved the idea of making a positive impact on the target group or the society in general.
We joined the competition as a team and worked hard on our solution. And we did it! Our team called “Bloodcall” got to the Top 10 Finalists of Solution Challenge 2022! It was amazing when we heard the news. Who would have thought, first year of GDSC HUA and we managed to have such a strong representation competing with so many other chapters across the world. Also for the record, we were the only Greek chapter to the Top 10, even the Top 50!
What a journey we had! GDSC was a fun and enriching experience from many different aspects:
I have to say that if you have the time during your time at the university, you should join the program, even if it seems hard at first glance — trust me, the experience is priceless. That was the journey of GDSC HUA on how it was founded and how we did in the first year of our existence. And the journey continues to the present — with new faces, fresh ideas and 2 co-leads. GDSC HUA is still active on campus and in the program. Pretty cool!
From my end, I want to thank all the members of the first core team for the amazing job we did for the chapter while also doing our best as students. Thanks: Manos, Mitsos, Thanos, Nikos, Thanasis, Alexandra, Petros and again Thanos!
I want to thank Harokopio University of Athens for a great cooperation and support. Special thank you goes to our Rector Mrs. Mara Nikolaidou and our Department Head Mr. Thomas Kamalakis.
Lastly I want to congratulate and thank again the Bloodcall team for the amazing job they did. Thank you: Thanasis, George, Stefanos and George.

The 2004 Olympic baseball stadium in Athens is currently not a baseball venue but a soccer venue. I went by in late 2012 and it looked ok. At least they are using it for a sport! See a lot of articles lately saying all the venues are falling apart or abandoned.
There is only one “main” olympic stadium still being used for baseball which is in barcelona host of the 1992 games. The 1996 olympic stadium was Fulton county stadium which was torn down,the 2000 olympic main stadium in Sydney was a showground for cattle and was only a temporary venue for the games. However west of Sydney is the 2nd olympic venue and it has been resurrected by mlb and is used in the abl league. The 2008 wukesong baseball olympic stadium in beijing and both Practice fields were reduced to rubble shortly after the games. So the Olympic baseball stadium in Athens below is still there. Maybe someday it will see a baseball game again.

For the next piece of my President’s Day getaway to Greece and Israel, I flew from Athens International Airport on Aegean to Tel Aviv, giving me a chance to check out the Aegean Business Class Lounge and the Aegean ground experience at its primary hub airport ahead of my flight to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my flight on Emirates from Newark to Athens, the Emirates ground experience at Newark, SAS Lounge at Newark, and stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked Welcome Pickups for my transfer from the InterCon to Athens International Airport (ATH). I scheduled a 2 pm pickup for my flight departing at 5:20 pm. The driver arrived promptly at around 1:45 pm. The ride to Athens airport was smooth and the traffic wasn’t too bad.
I booked the flight using American Express Membership Rewards earned on my American Express Platinum Card transferred to Aeroplan.
I found the check-in area quickly. Aegean had dedicated lines for its business-class customers as well as Star Alliance Gold customers. The line wasn’t too long when I arrived and I was served quickly.
I was not advised of any priority passport control or expedited security lanes for premium passengers. They also didn’t inform me of any lounge access despite its inclusion in my business class ticket.
There was no fast track for immigration, but I made it through pretty quickly. I didn’t initially see the signage for business class security so I got in the main line. When I did eventually notice signage for the business class line, I was already in the general line which was short so I stayed in it and did not move.
Once I cleared the formalities, I was inside the terminal. The Athens airport terminal was nicer and airier than I expected. I quickly found the entrance to the Aegean business lounge and made my way upstairs.
There were several lounges in the same area on a level above the terminal, and the Aegean lounge was clearly signed, but also recognizable from the strong Aegean blue. They are very consistent with their branding.
Curiously, the signs outside did not specifically note that Star Alliance Gold and premium passengers were welcome, as is common at Star Alliance lounges. This lounge, however, is indeed open to them and follows standard Star Alliance lounge access rules.
The lounge is accessed through automated electronic gates where your boarding pass is scanned, though staff was on hand.
Personally, I don’t mind the electronic gates as they allow quick entrance if your boarding pass is coded properly. But I do think being greeted by airline staff and thanked for your business is a nice touch that seems to be going away.
While Athens is Aegean’s primary hub, it’s primarily a medium and short-haul carrier and operates no widebody aircraft so my expectations for this lounge were measured. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the lounge, and the offerings. This is notable since I don’t think Athens sees much connecting traffic either, save for passengers traveling domestically within Greece.
The lounge was a very large space with several areas and buffet stations, with great views of the runway.
The restrooms were hidden in a corner. They were small considering the size of the lounge, though well appointed. Showers did not seem to be available.
Wifi was free and fast. Many seats were available with easy access to outlets which I always appreciate.
There was a large hot beverage area with a massive Nespresso machine and a very solid tea selection. For Americans, there was also drip coffee on hand.
I prefer cold coffee so I would have awarded bonus points if they had iced coffee or cold brew on hand, but that’s very rare in Europe, unfortunately.
A variety of mugs and glassware were available for the hot drinks. The hot beverages area also had various cookies and croissants.
Past the coffee station, there was another buffet area with a variety of pastries, yogurt, and prepared foods.
There were also salads, fresh chocolates, and finger foods. The hot food station had several items, though keeping kosher, I didn’t look too closely.
There was a great selection of beverages and a self-serve collection of wines and spirits. I appreciated that they had Greek beer and wine, and a lounge employee was happy to explain the different Greek beers to me and point me to his favorite.
There was also a selection of various newspapers and magazines, primarily in Greek. It would have been nice to see some English or international offerings though.
Keeping kosher, there was not much I can eat from the buffet, but reviews of the spread from my fellow passengers were pretty positive. I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate ahead of my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv.
Aegean does a reasonably good job with its business lounge, especially given its lack of widebody service. The space is large and comfortable space to relax before your flight. With plenty of seating, fast wifi, and ample food and beverage, it’s pretty solid for a long layover too. While the lack of showers was disappointing, there isn’t much long-haul traffic here so its less of an issue. I would not come early to experience this lounge, but I was very impressed by the offering given Aegean’s foot print.

As a lover of Percy Jackson, visiting Athens has been a dream of mine since I was basically old enough to read. I eventually decided to visit on my own as I had a writing deadline staring me in the face. On one hand, I needed to write thirty-thousand words in a week.
On the other, in that same week, I had found a studio apartment in Athens for £300. Oh! And I only had one week off my typical job. What should I do? I wondered.
Dreams were staring me down on both sides, until I realised, why not do both? So I did, I booked the flights, and off I went, laptop in tow!
I’ve travelled on my own since my first solo-inter-rail trip at seventeen, so this wasn’t new to me, but I was still nervous! As I can imagine you, reading this, would be nervous at the idea of visiting Athens as a solo traveller, especially if you’re an introvert girlie like me.
If you’re thinking about going, I bet the Parthenon is high on your list of attractions, so let’s break it down, because trust me, official guidance on this is confusing!
In this one article, we’ll be covering when you should visit the Parthenon, where to book tickets, as well as some incredible hidden gems at the Parthenon you should keep a look-out…

The Greek economy might be on life support, but at least one group in Athens is making the most of it and clearly thriving: graffiti artists. It has been suggested that Athens might be the best place in the world to be a graffiti artist right now. Or, as one of the practitioners puts it, “a little paradise for the graffiti artists.”
The city is in the middle of a graffiti epidemic. It’s a combination of high youth unemployment and underemployment, a general sense of unrest, and authorities being stretched too thin to do much about it. Frankly, the police have bigger problems. The result is an artistic free-for-all on the city’s streets.
Whether you want to call them vandals or street artists, they’ve been busy. Not all of it is new, of course, but there’s an awful lot of fresh paint adorning the walls downtown in the past five years or so. Shops, homes, bus stops, and pretty much any other wall — except, notably, places that have high security like banks and government buildings (mostly) — are covered in paint. Relatively few walls are spared.
There’s the usual scratchy hit-and-run tagging, but there’s also quite a lot that has taken real thought and effort to pull off. Some of it is youthful rebellion, some of it is political expression, and some of it is art in its purest form. And, of course, it’s constantly morphing, with new paint going over old.
And some of it is quite beautiful. Here’s a small sampling. Credit to the artists, whoever you are.
There’s a very interesting short documentary on graffiti in Athens that shows some of the painters in action. It’s called Alive in the Concrete, and you can watch it online here.

Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Peloponnesian War was the result of years of tension between two of the leading powers in the world of Ancient Greece, Athens, and Sparta. Athens was determined to build a widespread alliance that stretched all corners of the Mediterranean named the Delian League to provide protection against the Persians.
In doing so being the de facto leader they requested tribute to amass naval power and a crew to support it. Sparta was unsettled by this growing alliance and the power it wielded fearing that Athens’s intentions were more imperialistic and less a simple alliance.
By 431 B.C. the reserved feelings that Sparta held could no longer be contained resulting in a multi-decade-long war that ended with a shift of power and the downfall of Greek society. Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and the defeat of imperialistic Athens’s intentions had an ill effect on the Greek world.
The outcome of this war was more than just the decline of the once-great city-state of Athens, the rest of Greece crumbled around it. Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.
The Greek city-states provide us with an interesting look at history, a civilization connected by language and religious belief but separated by geographical nature.
Although each of these city-states remained within close proximity of each other, and some of less geographical obstruction, little alliances were formed. For the majority of their existence, they remained and operated as individual city-states only joining in the defense of one another in times of war to protect the sanctity of their society.
Of the Greek city-states, two of them stood out from the rest and have survived the test of time by both providing their individual contributions to the ancient world which have left a lasting impact on society today. These Greek city-states were Athens and Sparta, two that could not have been more different, and two of whose internal strife would be the ruin of the Greek city-states.
The most distinguished difference between Athens and Sparta was their individual choice of government with each constructed to fit their societal ambitions. Athenians were notably democratic, which objectively defied the Spartan’s oligarchical form of government that supported its militaristic way of life.
Athens obtained this government identity following the Dark Age through the reforms of Solon who first rid the poor from debt slavery to the rich through an act of “disburdenment” a method he proudly boasts about in his poems when talking about mortgaged lands,
“He took away the record-stones that everywhere were planted, Before, Earth was in bondage, now she is free”
and when talking about citizens enslaved in foreign lands that he set free,
“uttering no longer Attic speech, So long and far their wretched wanderings And some who here at home in shameful servitude Were held.”[1]
Solon’s reforms would further establish a method of government that represented the people of Athens with his creation of a multi-tiered government to include a council (boule) of four hundred men who were chosen to hear public matters of the people before the matters were carried on to an elected assembly.[2]
Men like Cleisthenes and Pericles would help Athens to further develop its democratic progression by instilling further reforms that helped to better represent the Athenian citizens becoming an influence to later democratic styles of government to come.
The Spartan government was ruled by the few, a senate or Gerusia made of 30 members who were elected for good conduct and were “absolute masters of the mass of citizens.”[3] In an attempt to avoid corruption between the two kings and 28 council members of the Gerusia, five ephors were elected from the public to serve as moderators, and of whom did not rise within the presence of the kings as the members of the Gerusia did, for they served the people.[4]
This style of government was supportive of the Spartan way of life whose male population entered training for military service at the ripe age of 7 years old and whose service lasted a lifetime. The Spartans thought very highly of their way of life and questioned the rise of Athenian democracy regarding it as weak as evidenced by the words of Lycurgus. When Lycurgus was questioned about democracy in Sparta, he simply answered
“Do you first establish a democracy in your house,”
He further downplays the significance of democracy and further promotes the effectiveness of Sparta’s oligarchy through his analogy of two puppies, both of which were of the same kin but each had notably different upbringings, one was catered to, lived indoors, and was fed regularly, the other hunted and trained in the field.[5]
When Lycurgus later presented the dogs before an assembly of the public he did so by placing food the dogs were accustomed to before them, and as expected the house-trained dog opted for the cheap food while the hunter sought the wild hare in response to these actions Lycurgus said,
“You see, fellow-citizens, that these dogs belong to the same stock, but by virtue of the discipline to which they have been subjected they have turn out utterly different from each other, and you also see that training is more effective than nature for good.”[6]
These societal differences would end up with the two leading Greek city-states entering into an unlikely alliance when the Athenians sought protection against Spartan interference in their own government by promising King Darius of the Persian Empire “earth and water” which was a sign of submission required of all alliance seekers with the Persian Empire, and when Athens did not fulfill their promise King Darius sought retribution against all of Greece.[7]
The outcome of the Persian War was not enough to preserve the unlikely alliance between Athens and Sparta, and for the next several decades they would walk separate paths as equal to their societal differences until they met once again but this time as enemies on the battlefield.
Athenians learned from the Persian War that they were at a financial disadvantage in warfare when compared to the Spartans who were a militaristic state that had an ample supply of endless soldiers, and to the likes of the Persian Empire with a vast network of client states.
When Athens took the helm of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League that sought to protect all of Greece from future Persian invasions from the eastern Mediterranean and in doing so, they adopted the Persian method of funding war knowing that the funding that a single city-state could provide alone was not enough to yield the success they were trying to accomplish so the payment of a fixed tribute from each alliance member annually was necessary.[8]
This decision served to be favorable for the Delian League allowing them to make quick use of the funds in its continuous campaign to expel Persians from harbors across the Aegean Sea, to destroy Persia’s fleet, and to liberate Ionia’s poleis.[9]
This financial arrangement would prove to be even more favorable to the Athenians when they undermined other league members to create an Athenian Empire to which they were subject and their financial contributions allowed the funding of elite Athenian sailors and hoplites who could endure campaigns and sieges lasting from a few months to a few years.[10]
Sparta, who was the original intended leader of the alliance that became the Delian League slipped back into its isolationistic state shortly after its formation and after Sparta was replaced as its leader by Athens. Even from Sparta’s state of isolation, Sparta watched on as Athens gained momentum in its rise of becoming an empire and its ascendance into the Golden Age afforded by the funds of the Delian League’s tributes. As this unfolded Sparta’s fear of an Athenian shift into imperialism heightened, and with justification.
Athens’s transformation into an imperialistic empire is best described by a certain characteristic quality that further distinguished itself from its closest competition the Spartans. This quality is known as “daring” and encompasses Athens’s traits of restlessness and expansionism in its rise to power and is best described by Thucydides in his recording of Pericles’ Funeral Oration that occurred during the Peloponnesian War where he records Pericles’s attention to the sacrifices made by fallen Athenians whose courage, virtue, and “daring” should be a model for Athenians who have survived for it has allowed Athens to compel every sea and every land to yield to their “daring” enabling them to be immortalized through monuments everywhere of themselves.[11]
Furthermore, Athenian “daring” is a catalyst for a theory that was composed by Thucydides that he believes explains the inevitable war that happened between Athens and Sparta. This theory is the theory of Hegemonic War.
Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War is a concept that he believed to be as true as human nature and one that is to be repeated throughout all of human history with one civilization driven by three fundamental influences: interest, pride, and fear, to advance its position of wealth and power until another civilization of the same interests intervenes in an attempt to stop them.[12]
Athens’s use of its position within the Delian League as a vessel in its ascendance to power saw the city-state grow ruthless, and become an aggressive bully when its authoritative role was challenged by league members who no longer sought an alliance with them. This issue was not self-contained and true to Thucydides’ theory of Hegemonic War when Athens and Sparta butted heads when Athens failed to resolve conflicts of interest that created issues with members of Sparta’s own alliance, the Peloponnesian League, leading to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.
In short, the cause of the Peloponnesian War can be attributed to Athenian’s “daring,” its own justification for imperialism, and Athens’s interference in the Peloponnesian Leagues matters. Sparta tried to settle conflicts of interest between Athens and its own league the Peloponnesian League through questionable measures when it threatened the act of war against Athens and its allies if Athens did withdraw its siege of Potidaea, a rebelling member of the Delian League with connection to Corinth of the Peloponnesian League, and abstain from its imposed economic sanctions against the Megareans in all ports within the Athenian dominion, which Athens saw justification for doing because they had tilled holy grounds and received revolted Athenian slaves.[13]
Additionally, Sparta’s stern ultimatum to the Athenians was heavily influenced by one of its strongest allies in the Peloponnesian League, Corinth, who urged the Spartans to a speedy intervention to the injustices being carried out by Athens, or Corinth itself and other Peloponnesian League members would seek a new alliance to join.[14]
Moreover, Athens’s refusal to meet the terms of Sparta’s ultimatum resulted in a three-decade-long war that saw Sparta fight against the injustices of Athenian Imperialism which they successfully accomplished by standing as victors at the end of the war. However, the war had adverse actions on the Greek city-states as a whole, many fell into economic hardships as a result of the war, and some were influenced by the two prominent Greek city-states of opposing governments to carry out civil conflict against their own people.
The Golden Era of Athens and its influence on the ancient world ended, and the shift of power to Sparta as the leading Greek city-state proved to be an utter failure, as previous foreshadowed in its leading role as a member of the what became the Delian League, resulting in years of conflict to follow allowing the Greeks to become susceptible to its latter absorption into the Macedonian Empire.
Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War and its overnight ascendance to hegemony over Greece proved to have detrimental consequences for all of the city-states.
Sparta, as Athens did before them, flexed its power throughout Greece proving to be just as bad or even worse for the Greek people than Athens was before them as evidenced by the choice of Sparta’s former allies aligning themselves with Athens in an attempt to hinder its control. Thriving in victory Sparta promoted Admiral Lysander to carry out an instilled aggressive policy that reformed city-state governments throughout Greece by placing harmosts (military governors) who forcibly established oligarchies as well as required tribute from all those they had conquered even though before feeling such power they had not even used coined money but now benefitted from the annual tribute of more than a thousand subjects.[15]
In response to these actions and backed by Persian money an alliance was formed between Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes who swore to defeat Sparta.[16] This conflict was the Corinthian War (395–387 B.C.).
The Corinthian War finished in a similar fashion to the Peloponnesian War with Sparta standing in victory benefiting from late financial support from Persia, when Persia switched sides leaving behind its original alliance with Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes. This would not be the final conflict between the Greek city-states in their pursuit of hegemony status, alliances would be reformed and reconstructed, and the title of hegemony would be passed amongst city-states until the mid-fourth century B.C. During this period of time, the Spartans suffered a dreadful defeat at the hands of the Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra (471 B.C.) that halted Sparta’s reign of power.[17]
This nearly century-long struggle to obtain the status of hegemony left adverse actions among the Greek city-states. The nearly century-long constant warring exhausted resources, depleted civilizations, and rendered each city-state barely capable of maintaining its own state, each becoming susceptible to rising power to the North.
The Macedonians under the leadership of King Philip II took advantage of the exhausted Greek city-states in pursuit of gaining hegemony status for his growing empire with little resistance to his efforts besides a single conflict against Athens and Thebes in 338 B.C. known as the Battle of Chaeronea. Athens and Thebes refused to yield to King Philip and the Macedonians like northern Greek city-states had done before them because as explained by the Athenian orator Demosthenes the Macedonians were not Greek or even related to the Greeks and not even a barbarian from an honorable place of mention so submitting to them was insulting to the sanctity of Greece.[18]
The defeat of Athens and Thebes by Macedonia proved to be the last nail in the coffin of the Greek power. Even though they retained a sense of freedom, any influence the Greek people once held on the Ancient World through their acts of politics and foreign policy completely ceased to exist, now they were subjects to the Macedonian Empire.
The outcome of the Persian War set the scene for the inevitable war between two of the greatest Greek city-states of their time, Athens, and Sparta. Following the war, Athens accepted a position as leader of the alliance of Greek city-states later known as the Delian League, with great ambitions to rid the Persian Empire from the east Mediterranean and the rest of Greece.
They were successful, to say the least, but with a stronghold on this great power, their ambitions turned personal. As the Spartans watched on from isolation following the Persian War, Athens used the Delian League for its own personal gain, in the hold of a massive and lethal navy, and with ample funds supplied by Greek city-state tributes they grew into a formidable empire.
Athens’s growth did not end there, soon they turned imperialistic, whether it was for Sparta’s own personal feelings of disdain for Athens, or its urge to protect Greece, the two city-states met with war in 431 B.C. The results of the Peloponnesian War would prove to yield irrevocable and unintentional consequences when the victor proved to be just as bad as the perceived threat they dethroned.
Sparta’s victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War was the defeat of the Greek city-states as a whole, inadvertently ending Greece’s Golden Age, Greek influence on the ancient world and rendered a constant struggle for hegemony status that was the demise of the individual Greek city-state.

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain
Centuries ago, a radiant jewel of civilization — Athens — crumbled. Not merely under the weight of Spartan swords, but under the erosion of reason, the rise of demagogues, and the silencing of truth.
The Peloponnesian War wasn’t just a historical battle. It was the death knell of a civilization that gave the world democracy, philosophy, and artistic brilliance — and then extinguished its light.
Today, as we scroll through headlines filled with disinformation, political chaos, and moral exhaustion, one can’t help but wonder:
Are we living through our own Peloponnesian moment?
The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) pitted the democratic city-state of Athens against the oligarchic city-state of Sparta in a 27-year conflict that decimated both.
Athens, confident in its intellect and naval prowess, made a series of hubristic miscalculations. It overreached, misled by populist leaders and reckless ambition, ultimately losing the war and itself.
The fall of Athens didn’t just shake the Greek world. It produced a spiritual and philosophical crisis that gave rise to one of history’s most powerful responses: the life and death of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato.
Socrates — a soldier-turned-philosopher — walked the streets of Athens, challenging assumptions, confronting power, and questioning the nature of justice, truth, and virtue.
He didn’t write. He asked.
And in a society growing fragile under the weight of war and rhetoric, questions became dangerous.
In 399 BCE, Athens condemned him to death. His student, Plato, watched his mentor die — and with that, watched the Athenian soul fracture.
Plato didn’t just mourn Socrates. He responded with a blueprint for a better world.
In The Republic, he paints a chilling portrait of democratic decay: how freedom becomes license, how public opinion overrides wisdom, and how a desire for equality can spiral into tyranny.
His solution? A society governed not by the loudest, but the wisest philosopher-kings trained in truth, detached from greed, and committed to justice.
Now, let’s fast forward 2,500 years.
Across nations, we see strongmen rising, liberties shrinking, and democracy faltering under the same forces that once undid Athens.
We call it progress. But in the quiet moments, history whispers a warning.
Plato foresaw the cycle of governance:
We are, arguably, at the fragile edge between stages four and five.
And the pattern? It’s not new. It’s timeless.
If Athens fell — and from its ashes, philosophy rose — what must we do to avoid repeating that collapse?
Here’s what the legacy of Socrates and Plato implores us to reclaim:
“The unexamined life is not worth living.” — Socrates But perhaps more urgently today: “The unexamined society is not worth sustaining.”
Athens gave us the tools to think. But when it stopped thinking, it destroyed itself.
Today, we possess far greater power — nuclear, digital, economic — but not necessarily greater wisdom.
If we let emotion eclipse reason, let division replace dialogue, and let power overpower truth, then we will fall, not because we were unaware, but because we were indifferent.
So ask yourself:
Are we the next Athens? Or will we, finally, choose a wiser path?

Thought is Western, is it not?
Then, why does the sun rise from the East?
Imminently, all the frauds I have been taught
Revealed themselves to be colonial beasts.
The Secularism of God.
In a house of lavish marble.
What once was a library has turned into the fury of charcoal.
You were my renaissance.
I could feel my heart’s pace again beat.
Knowledge may be bronze,
But you were the heart that gold breeds.
You were my revelation.
The final thread of hope in the inner child of mine.
You were my salvation.
My last supper; my bread, my olives, my wine.
You healed my wounded wings,
You watered my dying tree.
Dethroned the heartless kings
That held the ropes to execute me.
Knowledge may give power,
But you make me weak.
At once, let me in this hour
Dare to write rather than speak.
You were the art pieces I always believed awaited my thoughts.
The righteous pillars beneath all of my frauds.
The School of Athens has nothing on the stairs of Fisk.
None of the curls, the lace, the laughter, the hugs, the mist.
None of the empathetic brilliance wrapped up in a warm scarf of linen.
Hypatia’s eyes scream, “Raphael, where are the women?”
The grace I have been destined,
The bonds I have been foretold.
The youth of youths,
Only the blessed get old.
Philosophers have nothing on my friends.
None of the torture, the light, the breeze, the love, the bliss.
Athens has nothing on Beirut.
Mosque to church is holy palmer’s kiss.
Love imitates art, life imitates you.
Pieces of my heart, who else would I write to?

The sun, a dying ember in the twilight, cast long shadows across the Athenian marketplace. Among the stalls of olives and sandals, Socrates, his brow etched with the wrinkles of a thousand dialogues, sat hunched on a block of worn stone. His eyes, like pools of wisdom, watched the bustling throng, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames of oil lamps.
“Friend,” rasped a voice from behind, “the shadows grow long. What truths do you glean from this day?”
Socrates turned to see Aristotle, his beard a silver cascade down his chest, his gaze sharp as a polished stylus.
“The dance of life, dear friend,” Socrates replied, “a waltz of appetites and aspirations. We spin on a spectrum, woven of threads both base and divine — the hunger for sustenance, the yearning for knowledge, the sting of guilt, the glimmer of hope.”
He gestured to a young woman haggling over a basket of figs, her eyes bright with cunning, her smile tinged with shame. “In her, the primal barter, the dance of need and debt. Money, a cold coin, echoes the ancient whisper of sacrifice, the price we pay for survival, for power, for absolution.”
He pointed to a group of men debating philosophy under the olive trees, their voices rising in passionate waves. “And here, the fire of the mind, the struggle to transcend the limitations of flesh. They seek answers in the stars, meaning in the dust, a testament to our insatiable hunger for significance, our defiance against the indifferent abyss of oblivion.”
Aristotle nodded, his voice deep as the Aegean. “Yet, even in the shadows, there flickers a light. Ritual, the heartbeat of community, binds us together in the face of the unknown. In shared sacrifice, in the rhythm of chanted prayers, we find solace, strength, a sense of purpose that transcends the individual.”
He looked towards the temple on the hill, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. “But the shadows grow, Socrates. The marketplace, once vibrant with the hum of shared stories, now echoes with the click of screens, each a window to a solitary universe. The third space, the crucible of connection, fades, replaced by the atomization of the digital.”
Socrates sighed, a rumble in his chest. “A new dawn approaches, friend, a dawn where ghosts of information dance in the ether, and the stories we tell ourselves become the scaffolding of our reality. We must choose, then, with clear eyes and open hearts. Will we build walls of data, fortresses of self, or will we weave tapestries of shared experience, where the echoes of laughter mingle with the whispers of wisdom, and the spark of humanity burns bright in the face of the coming night?”
The two figures fell silent, their words hanging heavy in the twilight air. The marketplace hummed on, oblivious to their philosophical dance. But in the quiet space between their thoughts, a seed of possibility was sown, a glimmer of hope that perhaps, even in the face of shadows and screens, the story of humanity was far from over.
The stars began to prick the darkening canvas of the sky, each a tiny eye watching the ancient dance unfold. And in the murmur of the wind, a whisper echoed, a question not just for Socrates and Aristotle, but for all of us: what story will we write with our actions, thoughts and intentions when none concord?
In the poisoned vineyard of the web, nightshade and hemlock intertwine, their bitter fruit cultivated by a dark alliance: demagogues, serpents with forked tongues, weaving fear and falsehood, and aristocrats, spiders of silver and silk, manipulating the strings of information. These power figures, fueled by an insatiable hunger for control, are the origin of a festering inequality, where shadows of misinformation stretch long and menacing.
Children, once innocent buds sprouting in the communal garden, are twisted into warped reflections of the past. Demagogues, like cruel gardeners, graft onto them the bitter fruits of division and hate, while aristocrats, like watchful vultures, prey on their vulnerability. Escape from this suffocating garden becomes a desperate scramble for a centralized haven, a fortress of ritual and symbolic power, built not on shared values, but on the fear of the encroaching darkness.
The sun of communal ritual, once a beacon of unity, casts a dwindling light. Its dawn, a sinful song and story, faded with the rise of individualism, replaced by the harsh neon glare of screens, each a solitary window to a curated universe. Dusk descends, painted in the muted tones of isolation, where third spaces, once bustling havens of connection, lie fallow, echoing with the hollow hum of digital ghosts.
But even in the eclipse of community, there glimmers a stubborn hope. Seeds of resistance, dormant but waiting, stir beneath the poisoned soil. In the quiet defiance of shared laughter, in the whispered acts of kindness, in the flickering flames of shared stories, lies the potential for a new dawn. A dawn where technology, wielded not as a weapon of exclusion, but as a bridge of connection, allows for the reemergence of communal ritual, not as a rigid fortress, but as a vibrant tent, open to all, where diverse voices orchestrate a symphony of shared humanity abilities.
This is the challenge before us: to reclaim the web from the poisoners, to nurture the seeds of connection, and to rediscover the lost art of ritual, not as a tool of control, but as a celebration of our shared existence. This is the path to escape the garden of shadows, to break free from the digital atomization, and to step into the sunlit clearing of a future where community, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes of isolation, its wings strong and vibrant, casting a benevolent shade on the children of tomorrow.
The Athenian sun beat down on the bustling agora, its rays glinting off olives piled high on a stall. Socrates, sandals dusty and brow furrowed, leaned against the fragrant wood, a gadfly amidst the buzzing marketplace. Aristotle, eyes keen and gait confident, strode towards him, a predator seeking intellectual prey.
“Ah, Aristotle!” Socrates’ voice, sharp as Attic salt, sliced through the cacophony. “Come to barter insights, like merchants haggling over your precious olives?”
Aristotle chuckled, a deep rumble that resonated with the city’s heartbeat. “Indeed, Socrates. My thirst for knowledge burns as bright as this midday sun. Today, I seek your scalpel of logic to dissect the enigma of humanity. Tell me, is it true that death’s denial fuels our cultural ascent?”
Socrates’ beard twitched as he considered. “Hmm, a bold claim, my friend! Is it not fear, rather, that drives us to carve rituals from the raw stone of existence? These sacrifices, offerings to appease the unseen, are they not testaments to our primitive dread of oblivion?”
Aristotle’s eyes glinted like polished bronze. “But does not this very struggle against annihilation spark the flame of ingenuity? Look how technics, born from ritual, crafts tools not just for survival, but for creation! In this ‘Ritual World,’ as you call it, does not sacrifice, the conscious giving, pave the path to something grander?”
Socrates’ hand darted out, intercepting a passing fly. “I concede, dear Aristotle, ingenuity dances alongside fear. Yet, even your grand tapestry of cultural transcendence, is it not woven with threads of guilt and the sting of our limitations? Money, that cold symbol of debt and desire, does it not resonate with our primal shame, pushing us towards both heroism and the gnawing need for expiation?”
Aristotle nodded, a wry smile playing on his lips. “True, the clink of coins echoes with both ambition and regret. But is it not through this very tension, this economic pulse, that the Ritual World thrives? Power and expiation, like two sides of the same coin, fuel both the triumphs of heroes and the humbling rituals of forgiveness.”
“So, we paint different facets of the same diamond, Aristotle,” Socrates quipped, a playful glint in his eyes. “You, the grand architect of systems, see culture as a cosmic dance against extinction. I, the gadfly, poke at the underbelly, revealing the raw nerves of guilt and longing that drive us.”
Aristotle’s hand traced the lines on a nearby olive. “Yet, in our contrasting melodies, is there not a harmony? Your dissection lays bare the human condition, while my synthesis offers a broader canvas. Together, do we not illuminate the full spectrum of this curious journey, from dust to aspirations?”
Socrates’ voice, gravelly yet warm, filled the air. “Indeed, friend. In this marketplace of ideas, our voices intertwine, a chorus echoing across the ages. For the struggle for meaning, for transcendence, is woven into the very fabric of our being. And in this shared pursuit, the sting of doubt and the glimmer of hope become the rhythm of our existence.”
The sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched across the marketplace. Socrates and Aristotle, their voices blending, continued their philosophical duet, a dance of logic and wonder marveling at the mystery in the vibrant heart of Athens.
This is the story we must write, not with nightshade and hemlock, but with courage, compassion, and the enduring human spirit. For in the end, it is not walls that define us, but the echoes of shared laughter, the warmth of a helping hand, and the stories that bind us together under the vast, starlit sky.

The heart of Athens’ historic center is experiencing a revival. The 27-acre district is bounded by three of Athens’ most historic squares: Syntagma, Ommonia, and Monistraki. The Commercial Triangle, locally referred to as “Trigono,” is a working district, with commercial activity dating back to the 19th century.
Despite its historic and geographic significance, the neighborhood fell into disrepair in the 1980s. As a result, many buildings were vacated. By 2016, 17% of ground floor and 45% of upper floor spaces were vacant, while a survey of shopkeepers in the area found that 50–70% believed graffiti, lack of cleanliness, and illegal parking were serious issues. While there were pockets of economic activity, the neighborhood was not pedestrian-friendly and it was struggling to attract new investment.
As a city emerging from an eight-year crisis, Athens is making real progress in charting a new future. Under the leadership of Mayor Giorgos Kaminis, the city is employing creative solutions to improve quality of life, and his focus on cultivating community pride and optimism is making a real impact. One of his cornerstone projects has been the revitalization of the Trigono neighborhood.
Since 2015, Bloomberg Associates has worked with Mayor Kaminis to advance his priority projects by sharing expertise from the global network of client cities. Bloomberg Associates is the international, philanthropic consulting arm of Bloomberg Philanthropies, providing select mayors and city governments with custom consultation and mentorship.
This episode features conversations with Alexandros Kambouroglou, the Executive Director of the Athens Partnership, and Elina Dallas, the Project Manager for the Trigono program. Jake Elder of Bloomberg Associates Sustainability Team joined them in Athens.

Athens is often hailed as the birthplace of democracy. But Athens was also the birthplace of gay culture. Openly practiced and celebrated, homosexuality was part of the social fabric of ancient Athens. Today, the Greek capital remains a very gay-friendly city, with countless gay and lesbian bars, many openly gay celebrities, and a vibrant LGBTQI+ community. Athens Pride, the country’s biggest festival of diversity, is held every June.
Just like in every vibrant European city, Athens can be a handful for a first-time visitor. Here’s all the LGBTQI+ legalities you’ll need to know and all the organizations you’ll may have to contact, while in Athens.
Legal Status on discrimination
In Greece there are laws prohibiting discrimination based on sex, race, age, or sexual orientation; civil unions are legal, but not full-fledged same-sex marriages; a status many government officials say will soon change. The Mayor of Athens has openly supported same-sex marriages and many couples wait for it.
Homophobia
There has been a growing concern over homophobia, due to the rise of the far right in Greece because of the crisis. Although that was true, homophobic incidents are rare. The biggest opposition to lgbtqi+ issues is held by a few priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, who are by and large regarded as “relics” by most Greeks, who see the world change for the better. There have been fewer attacks on gay couples in the last 5 years, than there are fingers in one’s hand. Athenians don’t tolerate intolerance.
LGBTQI+ Organizations
There are many organizations for the LGBTQI+s of Greece and the vast majority of them is headquartered in Athens. OLKE is the most prominent one, pushing out the non-discriminatory agenda. For the young crowd, Colour Youth is a fresh and very active organization (famous for its parties) that acts more as a community of young lgbtqi+ people who want to have fun and claim their rights, than an old school non-profit organization. Positive Voice welcomes HIV positive people, and friends, who wish to stand for their community and help in any way they can towards a zero infections day. Athens CheckPoint is an NGO that offers quick and reliable HIV blood checks for free. It’s located near Monastiraki Square (Metro Line 1&3) and have very discreet staff.
Gay Publications
The oldest and most read LGBTQI+ publication in Athens is Antivirus Magazine, a Greek speaking, bi-monthly free press, that for over a decade chronicles the news and events of the gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer and intersex community of Athens and Greece. You’ll find it at bars, universities, hot-dog joints and many other places that support the equal-rights movement. One step further, Colourful Planet is a bookshop-cafe that has also turned into a publishing house. Young (or just new) LGBTQI+ writers are welcome here, to find a publishing outlet for their voice to be heard.
The Greek Capital is always ready for big colourful parades and out festivals! For over a decade Athens hosts one of the most dynamically growing Prides in Europe every June and the last couple of years, the Outview Festival of Athens draws international attention with its screenings and guests!
Athens Pride
The City of Athens wears its rainbow colours with pride every year, on the second Saturday of June, at Syntagma (it used to be held in Klafthmonos Square, but now it moved to the city’s main square). With countless events and parties leading up to the big parade, Athens Pride has developed to one of the most formidable in Europe. It’s sponsored by the City of Athens and it’s a custom for the parade to start on the Athens Mayor’s mark! It was in 2004 that the first Gay Pride was held and since then, more and more people and corporations support it and attend to its events. Nowadays it’s lauded as one of the most dynamically growing prides in the western world.
Outview Festival
Athens annual Queer Film Festival, although relatively new, has gained extreme momentum and is already included in the most important LGBTQI+ events and Cinema Festivals of the Country. Every year, for a week in May, a downtown cinema theatre (usually the state-owned Greek Film Archive’s cinema) hosts an international festival celebrating movies from all over the world, made by LGBTQI+ creators or with a strong LGBTQI+ theme. Directors, actors, screenwriters and more attend the festival, that also organizes forums and workshops for those who wish to learn more about queer cinema.
Athens is notorious for its nightlife! Expect even more eleganza extravaganza at the city’s many LGBTQI+ clubs and pubs! And not just for the Dancing Queens! LGBTQI+ travellers will feel welcome to any cafe and bar of Athens, as the young and hip crowd is always friendly and up for a talk. For those who love to show their dancing skills, the Athenian soundtrack is a loud playlist for every taste! Disco divas, pop guilty pleasures, progressive electronica, Greek popular music? You name it! There is more than meets the eye in those small gay and lesbian bars.
Keramikos
Usually referred to as “Gazi”, the Keramikos area, at the Keramikos Metro Line 3 station, plays host to the most famous gay clubs in Greece. Some have over a decade of constant operation and are still as popular as ever! Open seven nights a week, the party never stops here, for every lgbtqi+ night owl. Bears, next door guys and gals, fashion forward people, trendy celebrities are among the ones joining in the fun at Gazi. Out for a cocktail, a beer or just a glass of wine, whatever someone looks for, will find it here, including many hot Greeks! The square at the centre of Gazi area also has many cafes, burger joints, vromiko sandwich places and even a pasta to go, cause gay or straight, at the end of a long night out, you’ll want something to sink your teeth into.
Historical Centre
If you wish to start the night earlier, you could visit the Agias Eirinis square; it’s full of the hip “in crowd” having coffee, a snack or their first drinks, at the many beautiful cafe/bars around. A relatively recent Athenian highlight, the square is now considered the downtown meeting point and place to be for all aspiring fashionistas. One can sit at its numerous gay-friendly places and read a book, consult a map, or simply watch the passerby's. In the paved streets from Monastiraki to Syntagma, you’ll find the rainbow heart of Athens beating, until the sun comes up in the morning.
Victoria Square
Not hip, nor cool, the area around Victoria station (Metro Line 1) was once the go-to-place for gays, when there was no concept of equal rights movement, and many people were still in the closet. The many hidden bars gained fame back then, but also a devoted following, so it’s no surprise that some have remained, although they’re now more of “boy bars”. Many immigrants flock to these places, since most live in the area of Victoria, giving these gay bars a quite different and unique oriental attitude.
Koukles
Koukles deserves a chapter on its own. Founded in 1994, the club originally aimed at helping Drag Queens find a place to express themselves. But as we all know if you put many Drag Queens together the results are either Disastrous or Fabulous! At Koukles, fabulousness is mandatory! While many clubs offer Drag Shows (like BeQueer ), in Koukles they're on every night! Fierce and Fun take central stage as International Divas fight for the spotlight and our applause. Word of wisdom: Make reservations if you want to get a table!
How can one not fall in love with Athens? The Acropolis, the Nightlife, the Food, the Sun, the Sea. Would you think that only in Mykonos you’d find gay beaches in Greece? Think again! Athens will make you want to “Shante -Stay!” all year round! Pack your sexiest swimwear, cause in Athens, you’re going to need it! Being a stone-throw away from the sea, the city serves as the perfect place to combine sightseeing and summer fun!
Limanakia
Just like there is no such thing as a gay island, but then, there’s Mykonos, there is no such thing as a gay beach, but then there’s Limanakia. Easily accessible by bus or car, right before the coastal suburb of Varkiza, Limanakia is a rocky beach that started off as a nudist beach but evolved into a semi-nude gay beach. Take a dive at the cool deep blue waters and be careful when you walk of the rock, as it gets slippery. Here you’ll find many singles trying to hook-up and couples wanting to get intimate, or simply looking for a tan without swimsuit markings. The atmosphere gets very flirty during sunset when the sun dives in the Saronic waters.
Mavro Lithari
Following the road to Sounio, a few kilometers before the Temple of Poseidon, you’ll find not one, but three small gulfs that welcome gays! Right at the 48 km of the road you’ll come across three small gulfs that are the hotspot of hip people! A lovely mix of Athenians wishing to relax and enjoy a beer under the sun, without over-thinking or feeling ashamed to go skinny dipping, usually sunbathes here; there’s also a canteen to one of the rocky gulfs, which serves coffees and snacks to-go, an always important aspect to anything Greek.
Kakia Skala
Before millions of people lived in Athens, when its suburbs were nothing more than small villages, western Attika used to go to Kineta for a quick swim. White pebbled beaches and calm waters made a perfect getaway during a sweltering day. But then the sudden overpopulation of Athens altered everything, industrializing a big part of Attika, with a huge effect on sea pollution. Since then, many years have passed and the beaches from Kakia Skala all the way to Kineta welcome again Athenians during sizzling summer days. Somewhere well hidden, under the National Highway that passes through, lies a small rocky beach with pebbles that is for nudists and gays.
Today the Greek capital is a very gay-friendly destination, hosting the biggest Pride Parade in the country and offering numerous queer activities! However, the Athenian history offers an abundance of queer cultural moments. Homosexuality was openly practiced, often with official sanction, until Christianity took over. Plus: Plato’s famous Symposium takes place in the house of Agathon, a gay Athenian tragic poet who was the lifelong companion of Pausanias, when he receives a prize for his first tragedy.

At the entrance to the Acropolis, there is a plaque that commemorates Athens’ contributions to Western civilisation. The city has had an outsized impact in shaping the trajectory of modern democracy, philosophy, architecture, and drama, and I was excited to explore the place at the centre of it all: the Acropolis.
My day started at 9am after a quick breakfast of cold cuts and fresh fruit at the hostel. I had opted for a guided tour of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, and the Acropolis Museum, and I met my guide and our small group at the Acropolis metro station. Though I did spot a number of Indians on my flight to Athens yesterday, my group were all Americans and Canadians, with I being the sole representative from the eastern hemisphere.
Our guide had warned us that its best that we stay together and start the tour early, as three cruise ships had docked at Piraeus the previous day, and they would all descend on the Acropolis today, leading it to be an extremely crowded day to explore. By the time we reached the Acropolis, the crowds had started to thicken, with it being almost impossible to not be accosted by the sea of humanity at every turn.
The term Acropolis is from the Greek words akron, meaning highest point, and polis, meaning city. Though the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, it was Pericles who coordinated the construction of the buildings that the area is famous for today: the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Over the years, countless wars and unthinkable acts of destruction, coupled with quests for religious and political hegemony have seriously damaged these magnificent structures, yet they still stand majestically over the city of Athens to tell their tale.
The Acropolis, though in reality (that honour goes to Lycabettus Hill, which I visited later) not the highest point of the city, rises 150m above the sea level, offering its occupants a commanding view of the city and its surroundings. On a clear day, one can see all the way to the port of Piraeus, enabling the rulers to have enough time to scramble resources in the case of an invasion. The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta was primarily a battle for maritime control, as the victor of the war was guaranteed control over crucial maritime routes across the Mediterranean Sea. As my flight was descending onto the tarmac of Athens’ airport yesterday, I did notice the lack of vegetation across the terrain — the hills are pockmarked with shrub vegetation and the occasional olive tree, a contrast from the lush green vegetation that I’m used to back home in Kerala. Athens’ maritime prowess was thus a result of sheer necessity — the poor soil of the Attica region meant that the city’s only route to power and wealth was overseas trade, making a significant maritime presence key to their domination.
Our first stop on the tour was the Theatre of Dionysus, built between the fourth and the fifth century BC. Walking amidst its ruins, I was reminded of the contribution of the Greek tragedians: Sophocles, Euripedes, and Aesychlus, all of whom staged plays at this very theatre. There is also significant evidence to show that Aristophanes, the Father of Comedy, staged his play The Clouds at the very same venue, which eventually led to the trial and the subsequent condemning to death of Socrates. Artistic expression has always played an important role in maintaining the balance of power in society, and we will always have the great Greek playwrights to thank for their contributions.
A narrow path carved onto the slopes of the hill is the only way up and down the Acropolis, and as time passed by, the entire route became crowded with tourists. In most cities in Europe, over-tourism has become an increasing concern, with Athens being no exception. Our group slowly made way to the top, with the magnificent edifice of the Parthenon slowly coming into view. A former temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is the definitive epitome of Greek architecture, an enduring symbol of democracy and Western civilisation.
Tired from climbing the modest hill in the Athenian summer, we gathered under the shade of an olive tree for some respite, when my eye caught sight of a plaque detailing the foundation myth of the city of Athens. According to Greek mythology, both Poseidon and Athena wanted to be the patron deity of the city, and with Zeus being unable to resolve the conflict, the competing Gods decided to have a contest and leave it to the citizens of the city to decide which gift was better than the other. Poseidon struck his spear to the ground and a spring sprang up, and Athena gave birth from the ground to a magnificent olive tree. The water from the spring was salty and not very useful, on the other hand, the olive tree provided the citizens with food, shade, oil, and wood, and the city was named after Athena, who then became the protector of this city, which would grow to become the most powerful city in all of Greece.
The Parthenon is a stunning example of Greek architecture, with architectural flourishes adorning all of its surfaces. Only a few of the frieze, mentopes, and pediments, which topped its magnificent Doric columns, now stand, with a few of them now in the Acropolis Museum, and the remaining, unsurprisingly, now housed in the British Museum in London, carefully smuggled out of then Ottoman Greece, by British nobleman and diplomat Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin. The Elgin Marbles, as they are now called, are the Greek kohinoor, and the Greek have also been lobbying the hallways of Whitehall for its repatriation.
We then made our way back down to head to the last stop for the day: the Acropolis Museum. A magnificent structure of glass and steel, the museum houses remnants excavated from the neighbourhood surrounding the Acropolis. Consisting of three levels, the museum is a captivating blend of ancient and modern. The ground level showcases an impressive collection of ancient statues, excavated from the numerous sanctuaries that dotted the area. However, the star of the museum is undoubtedly the Parthenon Gallery, a breathtaking glass atrium constructed in the same dimensions as the Parthenon itself. The gallery holds the famous Parthenon frieze, the metopes, and the pediments, all arranged to mirror their original positions on the Parthenon. During earlier requests to the British for the return of the Elgin Marbles, the British Government made the claim that the Greeks had “no suitable location where they could be displayed”, and the creation of the Acropolis Museum aims to remedy this shortcoming in the Greek request for reattribution.
Our tour ended at 2pm and I felt drawn to explore more of the city’s historic charm. I began by strolling through Makrigianni’s streets and towards Plaka. As I walked the quiet streets of Plaka, the calmness of Athens became evident as birdsong filled the air, a rare sound in a bustling city. After a quick lunch of a gyro, I headed to the Athens National Garden, a green space in the heart of the city. Nestled between the park and the magnificent Hadrian’s Temple of Olympian Zeus is the Zappeion, a palatial building built for the Olympic Games. Named after Evangelos Zappas, one of the pioneers of the modern Olympic Games, it is now used for meetings and ceremonies and holds a place in history as the site where Greece’s ascension to the Eurozone was signed in May 1979.
As I wrapped up my explorations for the day, I found myself ruminating over the city’s striking blend of the old and the new, a harmonious co-existence of historical legacy and contemporary vibrance. Athens is a city that has continued to evolve without losing sight of its illustrious past, and as I continue my journey deeper into this gorgeous city, I’m reminded that every step taken in Athens is a step through time, an experience that only few other cities in the world can provide.

“If Athens shall appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.” — Pericles
During our recent family holiday in Greece in May 2023, we had the incredible opportunity to explore the ancient sites of Athens.
While the Acropolis and the iconic Parthenon were undoubtedly awe-inspiring, it was our visit to the Ancient Agora that truly transported us back in time. It provided us with a genuine glimpse into ancient Athenian life.
“The Ancient Agora of Athens is an archaeological site located beneath the northwest slope of the Acropolis. The word “agora” applies to an assembly of people and by extend marks the gathering place. In modern Greek the term means “marketplace”.”
The Ancient Agora of Athens is situated between Monastiraki and the Acropolis. The Agora is a captivating site that captures the essence of ancient Athens. As we strolled through the…

What if Socrates’ death sentence was justified? I’m sure you’re rolling your eyes. After all, he’s likely the greatest philosopher that ever lived and a method of teaching —named the Socratic Method out of reverence—bears his name.
Reverence is a good word to describe the current treatment for the man who possibly lived in 400 BC. Author Donald Robertson points out the presently popular Stoics used Socrates’ ideas as a building block. In fact, words written about him started Zeno of Citium down his path. Plus, Epictetus spoke admiringly about him as well.
The Oracle of Delphi even confirmed no one was wiser than Socrates. So, what could justify his punishment?
The philosopher’s curated story states he annoyed the Athenian establishment with his Socratic Method. In other words, he asked too many questions. Just think about your five-year-old nephew continuously asking “why” as you try to answer. Now, manifest that into a grown man’s frame.
Speaking of children, Socrates’ accusers also charged him with corrupting the youth of Athens. By “corrupting” most proclaim this means questioning their elders.

Many are troubled or have difficulty understanding the meanings of CLR James’s meditations on Classical Athens and his study of American civilization. Far more important than whether antiquity and modern societies consistently embody profound philosophical values is what are our own democratic aspirations. This is the riddle at the intersection of James Athenian meditation within his book American Civilization.
Can Classical Athens be a measure for appraising America? Can the world of Aristotle, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Cleon, and Pericles illuminate the ethnically and culturally plural United States? How does nuclear power compare with a few thousand Greeks battling in the Peloponnesian Wars, or at Marathon, Platea, and Salamis in the Greco-Persian Wars? As the 1950s began, C.L.R. James, a Caribbean radical scholar, thought this comparative thinking central for clarifying freedom and popular self-government. Perhaps sublimated within the American constitutional struggle for happiness was the class struggle.
Between the Struggle for Happiness and the Class Struggle
CLR James (1901-1989) wrote on diverse topics: Haiti, Russia, France, Ghana, and Hungary. He also purposefully considered Shakespeare, Herman Melville, the Hegelian dialectic, Caribbean women of the barrack yard, and the sport of cricket. Placing Classical Athens in conversation with mid-twentieth century America, this experimental meditation challenges us. Can we think beyond boundaries? This is what James’s book American Civilization (1950) poses to the reader.
James was detained as an undesirable immigrant and a political prisoner at Ellis Island in 1952. His defense strategy, though he never found a fit public platform for it like Paul Robeson, was to explain the dilemmas of American democracy and civilization to the public and overcome official authorities.
Why Compare Athens and America?
James compared tropes of ancient Athens and modern America. He discussed questions of popular self-emancipation that are subordinated by rigid historical materialist views. Whether poor, powerless, alienated, or aware of a conquering force, most observers have a false idea of toiling people's creative potential. This is a result that dialogues about culture, civilization, and democracy generally, assume commoners have no part. Perhaps, their lives are permitted as cultural decoration for society.
A Trinidadian activist and illegal immigrant to the U.S., James believed these ancient and modern societies were valuable comparative referents to unpack this dilemma of freedom. This was so, even though the classical Athenian city-state was probably no larger than the size of the population of 1950s Vermont, one of America's smallest states. And the ancients' economy was probably no bigger than one modern department store.
Who compares a continent-wide modern country to an archipelago of islands in antiquity? Of course, a Caribbean man who admires Ancient Greece. But he was not juxtaposing a small place with an imperial center. James was evaluating world civilizations and clarifying the search for popular struggles within them.
Every Cook Can Govern and the Meaning of American Civilization
We must remember that James’s Every Cook Can Govern (1956) argued that the classical Athenian city-state was a direct democracy. That this could inform rebellious modern politics against elite representative governments, whether maintained by capitalists, communists, or trade union hierarchy. However, in American Civilization, the Athenian meaning was more obscure.
A hint is James’s Greece tells us something about the relations between working people, intellectuals, and artists. Further, it placed the ancient theatrical dramas of Aeschylus and Aristophanes in conversation with the modern popular culture of American films, comic strips, sports, and television. More than what academic literary critics thought, James’s mind was on what the audience or spectators did in response to popular cultural productions in antiquity. Further, what could they accomplish in the present and future?
First, we must understand that at least since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. has been in a permanent culture war around social identities. The perennial dispute is Anglo-America, that some wish to “make great again,” versus ethnically plural multi-cultural America. American conservatives claim that Greco-Roman heritage is foundational to Western civilization. On this basis, some say America is a civilization. They wish to place the U.S., after World War II, as taking over leadership of the world from Europe. This cultural approach arguably last had free reign in the early 1950s as James was writing shortly before the emergence of the Third World national liberation epoch.
Cultural Wars Around Social Identities
Today the U.S. is seen by most progressive scholars of American Studies as not a civilization but as a harvest of empire. A plurality of many ethnicities and cultures have gathered; American Exceptionalism is not the best means to account for this. Though the idea that progressives are against the empire of capital is most often a cruel joke. This is not irrelevant to understanding James’s American Civilization. For he points out correctly that modern business management theorists during World War II understood, far better than the Moscow-oriented communists, that workers wished to directly govern their industrial workplaces. And the historical evidence of the practices of both, two different hostile visions to popular self-government, prove James’s view accurate. This explains much about contemporary not merely early 1950s America. Still, this issue is what the link to the Ancient Greeks is all about; discovering the sublimation of everyday people’s potential.
James’s Athenian thought experiments for America go beyond the culture wars which is really a misnomer. The question is how will humans live on this planet; this is what the low-intensity, sometimes open conflicts have been about. What values will humans live by? It does not require ancient Greece or modern America to historically maintain a consistent set of values for this meditation to be useful. In fact, creative conflicts in societies can reveal not just chaos through possessive individualism but common futures. Observation of Hegelian contradictions is not about permanent sins or hypocrisy. Rather, the nuclei of the new society and their struggle to be born.
Beyond Culture Wars: American Civilization and Ancient Greeks
James’s American Civilization (1950), posthumously published in 1993, embodied this transition between the old world of looking at things and the new. But not fully as we might expect a famous Pan-African anti-colonial and independent socialist to do so.
James carried on the tradition of the French intellectual Tocqueville, and many other European thinkers who visited the U.S. from abroad. He was perhaps among the last to do his own comparative reflection on how America sustained, or not, the older foundations of Europe, which many assumed were philosophically Greek.
Placing the Athenian Legacy in Support of Popular Struggles
Most Americans, even university professors, cannot process intellectual thought that doesn't adhere to the patterns of the two main American electoral parties that overlord society together. James, counter-intuitively for many, was placing the Athenian legacy on the side of the workers, women, and Black freedom movements. After all, he was writing about civilization.
American civilization needed a coherent political and cultural philosophy. He was aware classical Athens subordinated women, slaves, and immigrants. James was trying to improve on the direct democratic sensibility for modern politics.
Civilization and National Cultures?
Contrary to Andrew Ross’s view, James was not writing about civilization or the prospects of socialism in one country. Instead, he was asking what was behind the cultural front built around Franklin Roosevelt produced by state planners, progressive intellectuals, and trade union hierarchy.
James was writing about a perceived civilization or national culture and incorporating dynamic tensions. It doesn’t matter whether we or James see America as a unified national culture or not. American concerns with disunity reveal this is how the vast majority see things, even where they dispute the American character and purpose.
The struggles for an ambiguous workers' democracy, and Black and women's liberation, he reconciled with the ideals of Greek antiquity that normally was wielded by modern Western elites. James did not strongly emphasize, in this publication, America as foundationally an empire based on African slavery and conquering the Indigenous, and for good reason.
Discarding Historical Trauma for a Renewal of Political Philosophy
The reception of James’s American Civilization is fumbled where it does not center James as an aspiring cultivator of the popular will. Moreover, where it does not illustrate that he is trying to clarify the political philosophy of ordinary Americans.
James was writing for a popular audience, who in the aftermath of World War II, did not easily grasp anti-imperialism. We must remember in real life he agitated against World War II as a clash of racists, imperialists, and authoritarians on both sides. This was something the Moscow-oriented communists did not do. For, like Stalinist Russia, they became allies of Franklin Roosevelt.
Before the Montgomery Bus Boycott: Thinking Beyond Equal Opportunity
This manuscript was an exercise in creative self-expression and not merely disciplined to a radical political movement. More significantly, those who pursue the death of the American nation culturally and intellectually (but not really, it's just an academic trope) fail to posit what should be America's political philosophical basis.
While in the early 1950s, the modern civil rights movement as embodied by the Montgomery Bus Boycott had not yet begun, we must remember something crucial. Equal opportunity to enter the rules of hierarchy has no democratic basis (direct majority rule) and has only renewed the American empire. It can only have a democratic basis for those who wish to diversify the hierarchies of a republic, which by definition doesn’t believe everyday people can govern.
This perennial failure, but intentional act for those who sell past traumas for present decadent collaborations, was far from what James was pursuing. The colonized man from the British empire sojourning within the American empire was trying something different. American Civilization was trying to discover popular self-management beyond voters for electoral politics, aware the vote had not yet been guaranteed to all.
Gathering Fragments Like an Archaeologist
James’s American Civilization is like many ancient Greek texts. Their discovery and publication, as archaeologists and historians comprehend, is a retrieval project of incomplete fragments that only partially indicate the world of their authors. James’s final draft may have clarified and foreshadowed the nature of the American empire. Similar to his Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways (1952), he might have shown the solution was the motley crew, the global toilers of Herman Melville’s whaling vessel, cooperating and aspiring to save the social ecology under arduous circumstances. The preface to James’s Melville book reminded this was one part of a larger study of the U.S.
However, American Civilization articulates a scenario, seemingly outdated from the moment it was written. What if John L. Lewis, the famous trade union leader of the mineworkers, became the next president after Harry Truman? This was an irritating projection for those who knew James was an advocate of workers' self-management, and Lewis was part of repressing such social instincts during the Age of the CIO labor movement (1933-1955). Still, many miss the ancient Greek content of James’s thought experiment.
Learning from Aristophanes's Sausage-Seller
James argued that if American intellectuals in the early 1950s could understand artistic creation, like Aristophanes in his play The Knights, ordinary people could be encouraged to subvert populist authoritarian leaders, such as Cleon in the era of the Peloponnesian War. The ""sausage-seller"" appears to do this in The Knights; James’s American Civilization uncharacteristically refers not simply to workers, farmers, and cooks but to sausage-sellers, a plebian identity from ancient Greece. Though many Americans eat hot dogs and sausages, ordinary toilers have a difficult time revolting against bureaucracy within their own freedom movements.
James proposed, not an affirmation of the authoritarian trade union leader or progressive politician; rather, an impending confrontation with them by the ""sausage-sellers."" That Lewis was a Republican, who both sided and clashed with Franklin Roosevelt, and who was a major trade union leader, complicates things nicely. If James’s readers were actually going to think for themselves. Many formally educated have had difficulty since the book was published posthumously. Why write about Greek antiquity or workers at all?
James explained that observers of American civilization, unlike European history (ancient and modern), do not understand that behind great personalities above society (in politics, sports, and entertainment) are the aspirations, the repressed strivings of social classes and groups. While James believed every ordinary toiler could govern society, there was a counter-vailing idea. Those individual personalities who express heroism and creative genius do not mirror the abilities of commoners. But this is a result that society is not arranged properly for everyday people to arrive on their own authority. Many like to live vicariously through great personalities above society. James, the cultivator of the popular will, was trying to draw them out of their shell below society.
The Social Motion Below the Great Personalities Above Society
James felt the classical city-state was approximating or approaching this possibility in a more primitive way before the emergence of modern politics. We must remember the totality of ancient Greece is invented by archaeologists. Classical Athens functioned substantially toward a future without a past.
Behind the statesmen (Cleisthenes, Solon, Cleon, and Pericles) were the emerging “proletarians of Piraeus.” Observing and judging the artistic productions of Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, was an audience of rank-and-file citizens. Importantly, not professional experts.
James underscored it was the popular audiences of theatrical productions that thousands of years later were manufactured as “high culture” by American and Western elites that decided what plays were the greatest. And so, the ordinary people of Athens had the capacity for independent judgment. And given the content of the award-winning plays, they clearly had the ability to make political judgments. Therefore, James is saying to his American audience that popular culture is high culture. And the latter is a fabrication unless it centers the judgment and capacities of everyday people. Western and American elites would be surprised to hear this.
Aeschylus’s Oresteia, Dick Tracy, and the Mafia in 1950s America
In the early 1950s U.S., people delighted in Dick Tracy comic strips and films depicting the Mafia. For James, these had something in common. Ordinary Americans were not satisfied with hierarchical government; they wished to live outside the state and its law. Though, of course, these were impositions. Tracy, a private detective, surprisingly had something in common with gangsters. They had guns, took matters into their own hands, and were not police.
American toilers wanted to be their own law-givers. While Plato searched for personalities to discipline the grassroots of the city-state, he felt it was a must, where Athenian commoners, even slaves, walked the streets like they were audacious peers of elitist citizens. It is debatable whether this is structurally true of ancient Athens. Rather, this was James’s Plato observing and fearing, through the trope of Socrates, the popular self-emancipating potential. This is our audacious Caribbean radical scholar's concern.
Vendettas, Patriarchy and Popular Courts
James loved Aeschylus’s Oresteia Trilogy. The meaning of its series of vendettas is disputed. Does it justify patriarchy or suggest a rebellion against it? Does it point to popular courts as the meaning of justice or the state as an argument for containing the Furies? Nevertheless, the audience decided these plays were award-winning. More crucially, as citizens, the audience had to decide, after the play the meaning of popular justice and their role in carrying it out.
James explained you can only relate to this if you have the sensibility of the ancient Greeks. Ordinary people’s actual social status in ancient Athens, or in modern America, was not decisive. Paramount was, how in culture and politics, commoners found means to think beyond their leaders and act on their own authority. What was revealed in Greek culture, sublimated in plays by Aeschylus or Aristophanes and their audiences, could also be seen in American popular culture. This told James something about mass audiences. Despite their surface psychology, they possess explosive potential.
The Odes of Pindar, Bureaucratic Politicians, and Business
James points to the poetry of Pindar implying it tells us about the commoners of ancient Greece and the U.S. What could he mean? He means a society that celebrates sports and competition, whether in the Olympic games or in modern baseball and football stadiums, where writing odes to the winners, confesses the true character of their nations. This cannot be embodied by politicians and businessmen. The barefoot and poor, with state sponsorship, little league uniforms, or playing in the street, express creative capacities in games that society is not organized for them to do so in politics. This can suggest a decline and fall for America or an emerging new beginning.
The comparative conversation about Athens and America does not move in straight and predictable patterns, especially for those who think like a voter for elite representative government. But even if the reader is starting to enjoy this meditation, how do we account for James’s celebration of Phidias and Praxiteles? What do ancient sculptors and architects say about the American proletariat? Further, James often did not make clear what the Peloponnesian War and Greco-Persian wars said about the potential of commoners in Greece and America.
What Can Be Accomplished in a Time of War?
Many scholars recognize that the Peloponnesian War (the battle between Athens and Sparta, which Sparta won) revealed an imperial tendency in Athens just as much as it embodies the search for federation. It is debatable what the meaning of the earlier Greco-Persian wars should mean for America. However, America, following World War II, was coming out of the experience of both foreign wars, and race, gender, and class struggles within.  James is saying great art and great heroism cannot fulfill themselves during war; society can only support them when it has put war behind them. Still, ordinary people’s instincts toward popular democracy, initially suppressed, can emerge in times of war as well. Even, if the rulers above society don’t wish this to happen. For James, the Athenian direct democracy presided over by Pericles between these ancient wars, was a new beginning where all citizens took part in popular councils and assemblies. There were no specialists and experts that dominated James’s Athens. Contrarily, this had been the vision of Franklin Roosevelt's planners and cultural apparatus.   The average Athenian citizen made decisions on economic planning, judicial affairs, and foreign relations, all matters the community faced. The Athenians knew everything was political, and art, science, and philosophy were integrated with politics and government, not in a dogmatic ideological way. But in the sense that, Greek citizens made the decisions directly that governed their lives. James was searching for a future America with these ideals and principles; certainly, the American conservative only pretended to do this for white men alone.
James did not believe Aristotle's politics should guide 1950s America. Though one should read him to understand politics and philosophy. Aristotle's Poetics interested James where the latter clarified what Athenian drama had been about when society was not menaced by war. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes were about purging their audiences of pity and terror. Where the masses had pity for heroes, and felt society was stalked by doom, they might emerge to take matters into their own hands after witnessing such theatre.  However, to relate to this proposition, we must reject tragedy as fate or some catastrophe beyond our control. When an actual play comes to an end, what is at issue for James’s Aristotle, is what will the audience do afterward. James’s American Civilization felt progressive cultural critics in the U.S. instead attached themselves to hierarchical regimes instead of the unfolding impulses to popular self-management.
American Labor: Wartime Strikes, Wildcat Strikes
We must remember that during World War II, most trade union leaders signed contracts with the bosses for a no-strike pledge for patriotic sustaining of war production. As Martin Glaberman has documented, then the rank-and-file, through their wildcat strikes, took greater initiatives than they had, even during the early CIO labor movement. We must remember that the first March on Washington Movement that strived to forge African American civil rights, despite its zig-zags, was a wartime strike.
Ordinary Americans’ apparent consciousness and psychology yesterday were no indication of their independent insurgent action tomorrow. James made clear in American Civilization that if workers followed John L. Lewis or Walter Reuther, the auto workers’ leader today, this was not an indication of what may happen tomorrow. Where leaders follow the instincts of everyday people below society (or not), it does not mean commoners cannot rupture with them.
What Do America’s Wartime Strikes Have to Do With Ancient Greece?
What do American wartime strikes have to do with Ancient Greece? The Greeks who took part in the Peloponnesian War and the Persian Wars had their own racial, imperial, and patriarchal impulses. They lived through times of crisis where they did not know exactly what they wanted. It is these same people, who forged the first aspiring direct democracy. Separate from ideals associated with ancient Athens is a reality: imperfect people with blind spots were the foundation of an impressive civilization. This is so cross-culturally, when considering any world civilization, the search for profound autonomy must be drawn out of barbaric circumstances.  James’s American Civilization aspired to show that the purported genius of American organization was not a penchant for national production or industriousness. Rather, the main currents of American character are the capacities for popular self-government among ordinary people. Intellectuals who cannot see this, James says, commit treason. Our capacity to grasp this has something to do with how we understand Classical Athens.
Re-Reading Classical Athens Beyond the Affirmative Action Empire
A proper understanding of James’s Greek antiquity studies is still emerging. And aspects of how he grasped the United States are still obscure. Can ancient Athens, or its spirit and ideals, be a model for America as a civilization, or a comparative reference for our understanding of American freedom and popular self-government? Do we inherently clash with contemporary dispositions in such pursuit? Where it forces us to move beyond making America “great again,” but also the affirmative action empire and the ethnically plural police state, James’s legacies deserve reconsideration.

The history of Athens is closely tied to the history of Greek democracy. It was in Athens that this form of political regime, which contributed to the city’s greatness and spread throughout the Greek world, developed. However, the early history of Athens remains obscure. It is known that there was a palace at the future city’s location during the Mycenaean period, surviving the destruction at the end of the second millennium. This allowed Athens to be a refuge for Greeks who settled in Ionia in the early 11th century. Little is known about the city’s history before the late 7th century. Aristotle, in the first part of the Constitution of Athens, reports that the original royal power was divided among three archons, later joined by six thesmothetes. Initially appointed for life, then elected for ten years, and finally annually, these archons governed with the assistance of a council of elders on the hill of Ares, known as the Areopagus. Two events marked the late 7th century: Cylon’s attempt to establish tyranny, thwarted by archon Megacles of the Alcmaeonid family, and Draco’s creation of a legal code regulating punishment for crimes of bloodshed. Aristotle also attributes a constitution to Draco, which modern critics consider a forgery from the late 5th century by those opposed to democracy.
With the beginning of the 6th century, and despite the numerous obscurities that remain, the…

I just arrived in Athens. My cab driver’s name was Christos.
His father was from Greek Macedonia, his mother from Crete. Men in Crete wear all black as a symbol of respect, he told me, “for the men who fought and lost their lives in the many wars, ‘fighting for our freedoms.’”
“Greece has so much history for such a little country.” “Look at you, you have such a big country and so little history.” (Ahem… I had been reading Thomas Jefferson’s biography on the plane.)
Christos had a construction company with over 25 employees before the Economic Crisis. As work started to dry up, he continued to pay his workers and had to lay them off gradually as the money ran out. He still has a company “on paper” but there has been no work for years. The company was started by his father who, he said, cries because he thought he had given his son a livelihood and now there is nothing.
I asked if he was against Greece being in the European Union. “No, I am not against Europe, I just want Europe to care about Greeks. Not Greece. Greeks.”
Cristos has three children so, he said, what was he to do? He spent money buying a taxi license. Two years ago, it cost him 100,000 euros (from 250,000 before the crisis.) Now the price has dropped again to 50,000 but Christos can’t recover the money he has already paid. He says that there is no work and even if there were, no one would hire him because he has several diplomas — he is too qualified.
He was rushing to finish up and get home before tonight’s World Cup soccer match started. Brazil-Colombia. I asked who he was for. “Brazil, of course.”
“You know they have the most expensive player in the world: Neymar?” (I did know.) “One hundred million euros. That is what they paid for a futbol player,” Christos said. “We — this humanity — we have to change. We have to change because we have children.”
As he pulled into the hotel, he apologized, “So much history. Such a much bigger conversation.”
But, sometimes the only way to start big conversations is with small ones — like a short chat with a stranger.

“The Parthenon Marbles are part of the Parthenon Temple, the most important work of ancient Greek architecture, considered the highest sculpture and artwork of its time. Of course, its importance doesn’t end there; what happened afterwards contributes to its story” said Zeynep Boz from the eastern side, bringing joy to the western coast of the Aegean.
Boz, a prehistoric archaeology graduate with art, law, and ethics degrees, represents Turkey as the Head of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. She previously served as a contact person for UNESCO with the UN Security Council. When she declared that there was no evidence supporting the claim that the Parthenon Marbles were taken to England legitimately during the Ottoman Empire, she became the person of the week in Greece, making Athens happy. But what is the story of the Parthenon Sculptures, which pit Greece against England? What does Turkey’s cultural support for Athens mean?
The bust of Nefertiti, extracted by German archaeologists from Egypt and brought to the Neues Museum in Berlin; the Rosetta Stone, discovered by a French soldier during a fortification excavation in Egypt and sent to the British Museum; the statue of Emperor Lucius Verus, returned to Turkey after being smuggled abroad in 1972… History, discovery, and plunder… All have been intertwined for centuries. The fate of the marble sculptures friezes, and architectural pieces taken from the Parthenon Temple in the Athenian Acropolis was no different.
Dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, these sculptures went from Athens, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to England in the early 19th century. It was claimed that the artefacts were taken with permission, thanks to a decree obtained by British diplomat Lord Elgin from the Ottomans. Support for returning this significant historical treasure, which has often caused diplomatic tension between Athens and London, came from Turkey on the other side of the Aegean. Zeynep Boz, the Turk who made Athens happy, answered questions.
Your speech about the Parthenon Sculptures at last month’s UNESCO meeting attracted attention. Is Turkey’s support for Greece’s efforts to retrieve the Parthenon Sculptures from England unexpected?
Frankly, Turkey’s support is not unexpected. The Parthenon Marbles is already a matter on which Greece is never alone. Turkey’s support is both sincere and deep-rooted and not new. It has continued uninterruptedly with a non-political approach. Likewise, Greece’s support for Turkey in combating cultural heritage smuggling is equally vital.
I think the reason behind making Athens so happy is your statement about a controversial document. For years, the United Kingdom has claimed an Ottoman decree granted permission for the artefacts to be taken to England.
Absolutely. The difference in this year’s session was Turkey coming forward and saying, “There is no such document.” England claimed that these artefacts were purchased legally from the Ottomans, according to Ottoman laws. As in Turkey, we had to respond. I needed to correct this. Otherwise, as a member of a country holding the Ottoman State archives, I would have accepted this claim.
We need a document showing that the Parthenon was legally acquired during the Ottoman period. There is only one translation mentioned in England. I need to see the original alongside it to call something a translation. So that there is a reference point. There is only something written in Italian on paper… No Ottoman seal, no sultan’s monogram…
So, it’s like a piece of note?
I wouldn’t want to say it like that, but in a way, yes. At least I can tell, “It has no official status.” I know Turkey’s stance had a significant impact.
It is perceived as if it changed something. However, over the years, I have seen the great sacrifices and efforts the Greek delegation has made.
What if England says, “Then let’s look at your archives”?
Many British researchers have already come to Turkey. Not just at the government level. Many academics have come to Turkey and conducted research in the state archives. The Ottoman State Archives are already open to the public. This is not something we are hiding. So, I say to England in response to this claim, “If we don’t have documentation, wouldn’t it be better not to make such a claim?”
You represent Turkey at the ministerial level. However, you are primarily a cultural person. You say, “You don’t discriminate based on religion, language, or race; we unite in the effort to reclaim our cultural heritage; friendship transcends borders.” Are the recent developments a concrete result of the détente policy in Turkey-Greece relations that began towards the end of last year? Or is it an ongoing cultural collaboration that is independent of this?
I support the second option. The first option also influenced the growth of the second. When relations between the two countries are better, when the winds of friendship blow, the manoeuvring areas of every nation naturally expand; this is a fact. But believe me, it would have been said earlier if this had happened. It was a very natural comment made by Turkey. It was related to the moment; it was not planned. As you know, Turkey’s Minister of Culture Mehmet Nuri Ersoy recently visited Greece and met with his counterpart there. Following these meetings, his Greek counterpart briefed him on the matter.
When the Minister returned to Turkey, he requested information from us. He said, “Let’s always continue this support; I want to be informed of all developments. This is a global issue where Turkey needs to show its stance.” These are not insignificant developments. However, on an expert level, Turkey and Greece have always supported each other in a non-political, technical manner.
Is the British Museum now obliged to return the Parthenon Sculptures?
We know how much the habits of collecting and collection practices have harmed cultural assets and how much they have fragmented and destroyed them. I wish the British Museum would return them… We are used to seeing moves related to England that will be turning points in human rights and many other areas, milestones in world history.
Of course, we would like to see one of these regarding the Parthenon. We would also like to see this with artefacts belonging to Turkey. So, is the British Museum obliged to return them? The obligation can be debated. But at least in an era where apologies are being made, I would very much like to see the British Museum return these artefacts to Greece.

Thousands of pieces of ostracon have been uncovered in Athens.
These ostraka are pieces of pottery that acted as voting tokens during an ostracism. In an ostracism vote, people (free men) would scratch the name of someone who they believed threatened democracy onto ostraka and if 6000 or more votes were cast, the person with the most votes was banished from Athens for a period of 10 years.
The men who voted in this decision were part of the Athenian Assembly (Ekklesia), which was made up of adult citizen men. These men made up a fairly small percentage of the 30,000–60,000 large population which was also made up of women, enslaved people and foreign-born residents.
Ostracism did not happen automatically, the assembly had to vote each year in favour of holding one and often they were not called. In the 71-year period that ostracisms took place (487 BCE — 416 BCE), only 13 individuals were ostracised.
If the vote was to be held, the actual ostracism poll would happen two months later. The voting process was called the ostracophoria, meaning ‘election to ostracise’.
The unlucky individual who ‘won’ the vote had 10 days to put their affairs in order before they had to leave with no* possibility of return before a decade was up. If one did try to reenter Athens during this time, they faced the possibility of the death penalty.
Despite these harsh terms, an ostracised individual was still allowed to keep any property they owned and could still be considered a citizen of Athens, which, as stated earlier, was a privilege which was not extended to everyone. Further, on return to Athens, it seemed that little changed for the outcast and they could return to politics with significant social status.
No politician was safe from ostracism and it was extremely common for a senior member of the state to have to take a 10-year ‘break’ from Athens due to the vote. One such example was Themistocles, a non-aristocratic politician and general of the 5th-6th centuries BCE who had succeeded in leading Greece to triumph over their enemy, Persia. At one point, Themistocles was one of the most famous and important politicians in Athens, meaning that he was a threat to democracy.
The pieces of ostracon above hold the names, top to bottom, of Pericles (politician and general), Cimon (politician and general), and Aristides (politician). Pericles is the man who put into motion the building program that created the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis. Aristides is one of the lucky banished men who actually got to return to Athens before his ten years were up. Aristides was ostracised in 482 BCE but was recalled to the city-state in 479 BCE to help Athens get ready for the upcoming war against Persia.
Although the purpose of the ostracism was to vote out somebody who became too powerful, it’s likely many people just voted for the person they liked the least. Some of the votes found in ancient rubbish dumps seem to have had a message of personal grievance. Some names had the added epithets of “traitor”, “slanderer” or “adulterer”. The politician Cimon, whose name can be seen on a piece of ostracon in the above picture, had his personal scandal alluded to by at least one angry voter. Smithsonian Magazine writes that one ostracon had the words “Kimon Miltiadou, take Elpinike and go!” etched onto it, Elpinike being the half-sister he was rumoured to have had an affair with.
For better or for worse, the last ostracism took place in Athens in 416 BCE.
Should we bring ostracism back? It seems like a much faster and more efficient way of non-violently removing people from authority, than the bureaucracy that keeps politicians in check today. I, for one, am a fan.

Imagine walking in the footsteps of the greatest thinkers of all time, witnessing their lively debates, learning from their wisdom, and participating in their democracy. This is what it was like to visit the Agora of Athens, the heart and soul of ancient Greece.
The Agora was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
In this article, we will take you on a virtual tour of the Agora of Athens, and show you how you can think like a Greek. We will explore the fascinating world of the philosophers, who challenged the status quo, questioned everything, and sought the truth. We will also discover the secrets of the citizens, who practiced direct democracy, exercised their rights and duties, and defended their freedom. And we will admire the beauty of the gods, who inspired awe, devotion, and art.
Are you ready to embark on this journey? Then let’s go to the Agora of Athens, and learn how to think like a Greek.
The Agora was the birthplace of Western philosophy, where Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle taught and debated. These three philosophers are known as the founders of the classical tradition of philosophy, and their ideas have influenced countless thinkers and fields of study throughout history. But who were they, and what did they teach?
Socrates was the oldest and most controversial of the three philosophers. He was born around 470 BC, and he spent most of his life in the Agora, engaging in conversations with anyone who would listen. He did not write anything himself, but his words and deeds were recorded by his followers, especially Plato.
Socrates was famous for his method of questioning everything and everyone, often annoying the authorities and the public. He believed that the only way to find the truth was to examine one’s own beliefs and assumptions, and to expose the contradictions and ignorance that lay beneath them. He once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
Socrates was interested in ethical and political questions, such as what is justice, what is virtue, and how should one live. He claimed that he did not know the answers, but that he was seeking them with the help of his interlocutors. He also claimed that he was guided by a divine voice, or a daimon, that warned him of what not to do.
Socrates’ relentless questioning and criticism of the established norms and values of his society earned him many enemies, especially among the powerful and the wealthy. He was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety, and he was brought to trial in 399 BC. He defended himself with eloquence and wit, but he refused to compromise his principles or to escape from prison. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
Socrates’ death was a tragic and heroic event that marked the end of an era, but also the beginning of a legacy. His followers, especially Plato, continued his mission of seeking the truth and questioning the conventional wisdom. Socrates became a symbol of courage, wisdom, and integrity, and his example inspired generations of philosophers and thinkers.
Plato was the most devoted and influential student of Socrates. He was born around 428 BC, and he came from a wealthy and noble family. He was interested in poetry and politics, but he abandoned these pursuits after meeting Socrates and becoming his disciple. He followed Socrates everywhere, and he recorded his dialogues and teachings in his writings.
Plato was the founder of the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He established the Academy in 387 BC, near the sacred grove of Academus, outside the walls of Athens. The Academy was a place where students and scholars could study and discuss various subjects, such as mathematics, astronomy, music, and philosophy. The Academy attracted many brilliant minds, such as Aristotle, Euclid, and Archimedes.
Plato was the author of many dialogues, which are considered the most important and influential works of philosophy. In his dialogues, he used the form of a conversation between Socrates and other characters, such as his friends, enemies, or famous figures. He used this form to explore various topics, such as the nature of reality, knowledge, morality, beauty, and justice. He also used this form to present his own views and arguments, often through the mouth of Socrates.
Plato was an idealist, who believed that there was a higher and perfect realm of ideas, or forms, that existed beyond the physical and changing world. He believed that the forms were the true essence and models of everything that exists, and that they could only be known by reason and intuition. He also believed that the forms were the source of goodness, beauty, and justice, and that the goal of human life was to achieve harmony and alignment with them. He once said, “Philosophy begins in wonder.”
Plato was also a visionary, who imagined the ideal state and the ideal ruler in his most famous dialogue, the Republic. In the Republic, he argued that the state should be governed by the philosopher-king, who had the knowledge and the virtue to rule wisely and justly. He also argued that the state should be divided into three classes, according to their natural abilities and roles: the guardians, who were the rulers and protectors; the auxiliaries, who were the soldiers and helpers; and the producers, who were the farmers and craftsmen. He also argued that the state should provide education, censorship, and eugenics, to ensure the harmony and stability of the society.
Plato’s ideas and writings have had a profound and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most original thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
Aristotle was the most brilliant and prolific student of Plato. He was born in 384 BC, in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He was the son of a physician, and he had a natural curiosity and interest in the natural world. He joined the Academy when he was 17 years old, and he stayed there for 20 years, until the death of Plato. He then left Athens and traveled to various places, such as Asia Minor, Lesbos, and Macedonia. He became the tutor of Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, who conquered most of the known world. He returned to Athens in 335 BC, and he founded his own school, the Lyceum, where he taught and wrote until his death in 322 BC.
Aristotle was the author of many works, which cover almost every field of knowledge, such as logic, ethics, politics, biology, physics, and metaphysics. He wrote in a systematic and analytical style, using observation, classification, and deduction. He was the first to develop a comprehensive and coherent system of philosophy, which aimed to explain the nature and causes of everything that exists.
Aristotle was an empiricist, who believed that knowledge was derived from experience and observation of the physical world. He rejected Plato’s theory of forms, and he argued that the essence and form of a thing were inseparable from its matter and substance. He also argued that the world was composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire, and that each element had a natural place and motion. He also argued that the world was governed by four causes: the material cause, which was the matter of a thing; the formal cause, which was the shape and structure of a thing; the efficient cause, which was the agent or force that produced a thing; and the final cause, which was the purpose or goal of a thing. He once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”
Aristotle was also a practical and ethical thinker, who was interested in the best way of living and the best form of government. He wrote the Nicomachean Ethics, which is considered one of the most influential works of moral philosophy. In the Nicomachean Ethics, he argued that the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life was happiness, which he defined as the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. He also argued that there were two types of virtue: intellectual virtue, which was acquired by learning and reasoning; and moral virtue, which was acquired by habit and practice. He also argued that virtue was a mean between two extremes, or vices, and that it required practical wisdom and moral judgment.
Aristotle also wrote the Politics, which is considered one of the most influential works of political philosophy. In the Politics, he argued that the state was a natural and necessary institution, which arose from the human need for social and political association. He also argued that there were different types of states, according to their constitution and their aim. He classified the states into six categories, based on the number and the quality of the rulers: monarchy, aristocracy, and polity, which were the good forms; and tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy, which were the bad forms. He also argued that the best form of state was the polity, which was a mixed and balanced constitution, where the middle class had the power and the common good was the aim.
Aristotle’s ideas and writings have had a tremendous and lasting impact on the history of philosophy, science, art, and politics. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential thinkers of all time, and his legacy is still alive and relevant today.
The Agora was also the center of Athenian democracy, where citizens voted and served as jurors. Athens was the first city-state to adopt a system of direct democracy, where every male citizen had the right and the duty to participate in the government. The Agora was where they gathered to elect magistrates, pass laws, and decide on war and peace. The Agora was also where they held trials, where citizens acted as both judges and jurors. One of the most famous trials was that of Socrates, who was accused of corrupting the youth and impiety. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.
But what exactly was democracy? And how did it work in Athens?
The word democracy means “rule by the people” in ancient Greek. It was a radical and revolutionary idea, that challenged the traditional forms of government, such as monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. It was based on the principle of equality, that all citizens had the same rights and responsibilities, regardless of their wealth, status, or birth. It was also based on the principle of freedom, that all citizens had the liberty to express their opinions, to choose their leaders, and to hold them accountable.
Democracy in Athens was not the same as democracy today. It was a direct and participatory democracy, where citizens made decisions by themselves, without representatives or intermediaries. It was also an exclusive and limited democracy, where only adult male citizens had the right to vote, while women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. It was also a fragile and unstable democracy, where factions, conflicts, and coups threatened its survival.
Democracy in Athens was practiced mainly in two institutions: the Assembly and the Courts. The Assembly was the main legislative and executive body, where citizens met at least once a month, and sometimes more often, to discuss and vote on various issues, such as laws, decrees, taxes, treaties, and wars. The Assembly was open to all citizens, who could attend, speak, and vote. The Assembly was also the supreme authority, that could elect, appoint, or dismiss magistrates, such as generals, treasurers, or archons. The Assembly was also the sovereign body, that could revise, amend, or abolish the constitution, or the fundamental laws of the state.
The Courts were the main judicial body, where citizens served as judges and jurors. The Courts were divided into several types, according to the nature and the amount of the cases, such as civil, criminal, public, or private. The Courts were composed of a large number of citizens, who were selected by lot, or randomly, from a pool of volunteers. The Courts were independent and autonomous, that could not be influenced or controlled by the Assembly or the magistrates. The Courts were also powerful and decisive, that could impose penalties, such as fines, exile, or death.
Democracy in Athens was a remarkable and unprecedented experiment, that inspired and influenced many other states and civilizations. It was also a challenging and demanding system, that required the active and informed participation of the citizens. It was also a noble and admirable ideal, that sought to achieve the common good and the public interest.
The Agora was also the place where temples and altars were dedicated to various gods and goddesses. The ancient Greeks were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods, each with their own personality and domain. The Agora had shrines for Zeus, the king of the gods; Athena, the patron goddess of Athens; Apollo, the god of the sun and music; Ares, the god of war; and many others. The Agora was also where religious festivals and ceremonies were held, such as the Panathenaia, the most important festival in honor of Athena. The festival included athletic contests, musical competitions, sacrifices, and a procession that carried a new robe for the statue of Athena.
But who were these gods and goddesses? And how did they influence the life and culture of the ancient Greeks?
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the personifications of the natural forces and phenomena, such as the sky, the sea, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the fire, the thunder, the rain, and the seasons. They were also the patrons and protectors of various aspects of human life, such as love, war, wisdom, justice, beauty, agriculture, commerce, and art. They were also the ancestors and relatives of the heroes and the legends, such as Hercules, Perseus, and Jason.
The ancient Greeks had a complex and rich mythology, that explained the origin and the history of the world, the gods, and the humans. They believed that the world was created by Chaos, the primordial void, from which emerged the first gods, such as Gaia, the earth; Uranus, the sky; and Tartarus, the underworld. They also believed that the gods were involved in a series of conflicts and wars, such as the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians; and the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the Olympians. They also believed that the gods interacted and intervened in the affairs of the humans, sometimes helping, sometimes harming, and sometimes falling in love with them.
The ancient Greeks worshipped and honored the gods in various ways, such as building temples and altars, making sacrifices and offerings, performing rituals and ceremonies, and holding festivals and games. They also sought the favor and the guidance of the gods, by consulting oracles and diviners, by making vows and prayers, and by following omens and signs. They also feared and respected the gods, by obeying their laws and commands, by avoiding their wrath and punishment, and by accepting their fate and will.
The ancient Greeks also expressed their admiration and devotion to the gods through art and literature, such as sculpture, painting, pottery, poetry, and drama. They created magnificent and realistic statues of the gods, such as the statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They also depicted the gods and their stories on various objects, such as vases, coins, and jewelry. They also composed epic and lyrical poems about the gods and their deeds, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer, and the Theogony and the Works and Days by Hesiod. They also wrote and performed tragic and comic plays about the gods and their relations with the humans, such as the Oresteia by Aeschylus, the Oedipus Rex by Sophocles, and the Bacchae by Euripides.
The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks were the sources of awe and art, that inspired and influenced the life and culture of the ancient Greeks. They were also the symbols and the expressions of the values and the ideals of the ancient Greeks, such as courage, wisdom, beauty, and justice. They were also the reflections and the projections of the hopes and the fears of the ancient Greeks, such as love, war, fate, and death.
The Agora of Athens was more than just a marketplace. It was the hub of civilization, where philosophy, democracy, and religion flourished. It was where the ancient Greeks shaped their culture, their values, and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens witnessed the rise and fall of the Athenian democracy, the glory and tragedy of the Greek civilization, and the birth and development of the Western thought. It was the place where Socrates questioned and challenged, where Plato dreamed and idealized, where Aristotle observed and analyzed, where citizens voted and debated, where gods were worshipped and honored, and where art and literature were created and celebrated.
The Agora of Athens is a place that still inspires us today, and that we can learn from and admire. It is a place that reminds us of the achievements and the challenges of the human spirit, of the values and the ideals of the human society, and of the hopes and the fears of the human condition.
If you ever have the chance to visit Athens, don’t miss the opportunity to see the Agora for yourself. You will feel like you are traveling back in time, and you will discover the roots of Western civilization. You will also feel like you are connecting with the ancient Greeks, and you will understand their worldview and their legacy.
The Agora of Athens is not just a historical site. It is a living and breathing museum, where you can see, touch, and feel the history, the culture, and the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. It is also a vibrant and lively square, where you can meet, talk, and interact with the modern Greeks, who are the descendants and the inheritors of the ancient Greeks.
The Agora of Athens is a place where you can think like a Greek, act like a Greek, and be like a Greek. It is a place where you can experience the past, the present, and the future of the Greek civilization. It is a place where you can find yourself, lose yourself, and rediscover yourself.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you will never forget, and that you will always remember. It is a place that will change you, and that you will change. It is a place that will challenge you, and that you will challenge. It is a place that will inspire you, and that you will inspire.
The Agora of Athens is a place that awaits you, and that you await. It is a place that welcomes you, and that you welcome. It is a place that invites you, and that you invite.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should visit, and that you will visit. It is a place that you should see, and that you will see. It is a place that you should know, and that you will know.
The Agora of Athens is a place that you should love, and that you will love.

This artwork contains the presence of humans. There are many people gathering up against each other while doing what seems to be studying. Proven by the books they carried and read, these figures represent all of the greatest mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists that lived in that specific decade. Dozens of these geniuses all gathered around to discuss, sharing their ideas, expressing their opinions, and learning from each other. The architectural yet enormous building is mostly painted white. Some figures lay on the ground, reading and conversing. Some are upstairs gathering together, making a little crowd. The color palette was mostly vibrant, but washed out. Yet you can still see the soft contrast between the people’s clothes and backgrounds.
The artist used shapes such as cubes, rounded, and curved to create perspectives on the architectural building. At the front, we can see the building’s perspective from the curved line on the roof. But the overall structure of the building was probably cubed or a block. These different and neatly spread types of shapes made the artwork look more composed. The whole composition looked like it was moving. Because the artist made designs of people interacting with one another, they also made the color palette soft, so it radiates peacefulness. The central interest of this artwork is the two main characters that were painted in the middle of the commotion. It was obvious to spot them since the other individuals were all gathering around them. The artist succeeded in gaining my attention to the two by highlighting the middle of the painting. As you can see, the area where they stand is a bit lighter than the rest. Such little details make the biggest difference when it comes to painting.
The painting took place during the historical era of Plato. Let’s analyze the most distinctive element, which is the two people that were standing in the middle. Research claims that the two characters happen to be Plato and Aristotle. Plato was wearing red and purple. This color symbolizes the color of spirituality. A color that inspires reflection and self-awareness. While Aristotle was wearing blue with brown, which symbolizes the sky, sea, and earth, it also represents reliability and wisdom. These are the two main elements that the artist wanted to show through the main characters. The overall mood of the painting has a sign of coolness and warmth at the same time. The cool color tones that were used actually made the mood warm because the amount of commotion made the painting somewhat peaceful and relaxing to see. The landscape came off as natural, as the painting used a little bit of green for the building, so the piece itself was naturalistic. The object of the monument was already perfect because it holds and completes the inside of the painting, which is the people.
Paragraph one explains what is happening in the painting. We already knew they were discussing and trying to express their thoughts. This represents all of the different opinions and answers between people. The painting shows us geniuses. Mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. Yet they are gathering together, trying to find and gain answers. This shows that everyone can disagree with one another. They can have different thoughts and philosophies about one case. The artist is trying to say that even if we are concerned and confused about a single matter, humans will try to find a way to solve it. The main theme behind this piece is the high Renaissance. If I were inside The School of Athens, I would probably try to catch up on the topic that was being discussed, so I wouldn’t feel left out. The story behind this art is that it’s positioned facing Disputa and symbolizes philosophy, setting up a contrast between religious and lay beliefs. The painting is abstract because it looks at other non-objective artistic elements of shape, form, and color. The artist explored his ideas beyond the canvas and physical reality. I would explain this artwork as a painting where people gathered up all their ideas. As proven by the painting itself and the dozen people there.
Raphael had created a masterpiece and expressive drawing. The soft and cool tones he used added to the overall feeling of composure, calm, and relaxation. The unseen movement between the people makes me feel at ease just by looking at it. The faint green tones developed a sign of liveliness and nature. For me personally, this artwork does not need any improvements, as it is already perfect and has met the criteria for being the aesthetic theory of Renaissance art.

Initially, I was skeptical. In the age of Covid, do people even attend conferences anymore? With free educational content on YouTube and virtual conferences on Zoom, what’s the point? Despite my doubts, I found myself driving to Athens to participate in Devoxx 2023. Devoxx Greece is a three-day event where developer communities gather to discover the latest technological advancements, presented by some of the most inspiring speakers in the industry. The Devoxx family, which includes Belgium, France, UK, Poland, Marocco, and Ukraine, welcomes over 15,000 Devoxxians annually!
To my surprise, the conference was exceptionally well-organized, and the turnout was impressive. Four large rooms were filled with enthusiastic attendees, eager to absorb the knowledge shared in each session. The talks were organized into the following tracks: Architecture, Containers & Infrastructure, Data & AI, Development Practices, Java, UI & UX, Programming Languages, and Security. In this post, I will share my impressions and key takeaways from the talks I attended.
But first some pictures from the venue and the event.
Let’s see some of the main points for the talks that I had attended and enjoyed :-)
Ted aimed to bridge the gap between developers and managers in his well-prepared talk, which was filled with numerous real-life examples from his own experiences. The presentation focused on the key responsibilities of managers, such as assembling strong teams rather than just hiring star programmers, fostering an environment that helps developers achieve a state of flow, minimizing disruptions by reducing unnecessary meetings, and even making tough decisions like relocating or dismissing individuals who negatively impact team dynamics.
Natalie, a Community Ambassador for OpenAI, showcased the latest advancements in AI, specifically focusing on transformers. One notable takeaway from her presentation was the introduction of Phind, an impressive AI-powered search engine designed for developers. This innovative tool not only cites sources but also automatically generates follow-up questions, among other features.
Apache Kafka has become the go-to standard for high-performance data streaming applications. Such applications are rarely focused solely on message processing; they often need to integrate Kafka messages with remote endpoints, store messages in a datastore, or relay them to third-party services.
Ozan from Red Hat showcased how Quarkus, combined with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, can be used to build Kafka-based event-driven architectures. Quarkus is a cloud-native, (Linux) container-first framework designed for creating Java applications. Using a sample application, Ozan demonstrated the key concepts and common patterns, illustrating how Quarkus simplifies the development of event-driven microservices and integrates seamlessly with Quarkus’ reactive core.
What an incredible talk! Dan delved into a fascinating concept: leveraging the untapped potential of a company’s computers by running tasks in Chrome tabs. Each tab functions as an isolated environment and boasts a robust API. So, why not utilize the browsers within an organization to act as containers for running workloads, ultimately saving money on servers? I’m eager to get my hands on the source code he demonstrated!
Eliza from Amity showed how she can effectively create with the help of Generative models technical (code) and nontechnical presentations with a clear structure, slides with bullet points, images, and or even videos.
Jane introduced us to Qwik, a novel JavaScript framework that employs a unique rendering paradigm called “resumability.” This approach allows a JavaScript app to be serialized into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique commonly used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. Qwik enables the creation of “resumable apps” that require minimal JavaScript for interactivity and employ fine-grained lazy loading to load only the necessary components. Jane’s talk provided guidance on getting started with Qwik.
The key points covered in her presentation included: understanding the Qwik framework, comparing Qwik to React and Angular, strategies for reducing the size of JS bundles, and a tutorial on building with Qwik. The presentation piqued my interest, and I’m eager to give Qwik a try.
Dionysis, the Director of DevOps at GWI, showed us OPA: Open Policy Agent, which makes it possible to write policies that test the changes Terraform is about to make before it makes them. Also, he combined OPA with another open-source tool called infracost that calculates the cost of a terraform plan. This way he can also test and limit the cost of a terraform plan before actually applying it. Nice ideas for our DevOps!
Frank, a principal at Databricks, delivered a lively and engaging presentation on Data Lakehouse, a new platform from Databricks that blends the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. This innovative approach provides the reliability, robust governance, and performance associated with data warehouses, while also offering the openness, flexibility, and machine learning support characteristic of data lakes. Essentially, data is stored at the S3 level, but ACID transactions can be performed on top of it. An important takeaway from the presentation was that the term “real-time pipelines” may be somewhat misleading, as there is always a slight latency. Additionally, Frank introduced the appealing concept of continuously ingesting all data and replacing traditional ELT pipelines with streaming pipelines — truly cutting-edge ideas!
Emilia, a software engineer specializing in mobile gaming technologies, shared insights from psychology and cognitive sciences to illustrate how their application can lead to more effective user experiences, both positively and negatively.
Key topics covered in her presentation included dual process theory, heuristics, the illusory truth effect, the paradox of choice, priming, and inadvertent priming, among others.
(Note to myself from the talk: The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over other from William James)
In his presentation, Mohammed, an avid Formula 1 enthusiast, explored how we can make our code deployments as secure as Formula 1 races. Drawing from various principles employed in F1, he demonstrated how we can learn from and adopt these concepts in the way we design, structure, deliver, and safeguard our systems.
The talk covered:
+ Importance of having a trusted and adversarial CI/CD pipeline
+ Security patterns: Least privileged principal, defence in depth, Zero trust
+ Resiliency patterns: Micro-segmentation, Anti-overload patterns
+ Monitoring and alerting
In Cassandra’s presentation, she offered a wealth of both theoretical and practical guidance on leveraging social media, podcasting, and YouTube to establish a meaningful personal brand that not only benefits one’s career but also contributes to the community. These platforms have evolved from simply being enjoyable ways to share our lives and connect with others to becoming essential tools for networking and career advancement. During the talk, attendees heard about individuals whose personal brands played a key role in their success as esteemed developers, managers, and community leaders. Participants learned how to utilize their online presence for career growth and received valuable insights on best practices, common pitfalls, and strategies for striking a balance between professional and personal content.
In this presentation, Chris discusses the approach they devised for executing chaos engineering scenarios. The aim was to conduct exercises for new team members, acquainting them with alarms and the complete incident response procedure to ensure their preparedness for real situations. He demonstrated the rationale behind conducting such experiments, the design process, implementation, and ultimately, the evaluation and application of the solution.
This is a brief summary of some of the talks I attended. I’d like to thank the Devoxx team for organizing such a professionally-run conference. The audience was genuinely enthusiastic, and many valuable and meaningful conversations and connections took place. Be sure to visit Devoxx’s official website or Facebook page. I’ll attempt to share my impressions of the remaining talks in a future post.

What is Western Civilization and where did it come from?
This is the question I have been seeking answers to which has guided much of my reading. Today, those answers are coming from Jacob Howland’s book, Plato and the Talmud.
I first heard of the idea that Western Civilization is a combination of Athens and Jerusalem from Ben Shapiro in his book The Right Side of History. It made some sense to me then but the more I dig, the more sense it makes. There is a resistance for some people to understand and even admit that much of our culture is Biblically derived, but I don’t see any way around it.
At this point, I don’t think anyone can understand Western Civilization without an understanding of the Bible in the same way that we would expect them to understand Greek philosophy. And when someone tries to convince me otherwise, I take it as evidence that they don’t understand our civilization and will not until they get over that hump.
What Howland is doing in this book is comparing those two distinct lines of thought and describing their similarities and their differences.
One major difference which I have suspected is a key ingredient in the Bible missing from…

Before you start reading, I bet you’re wondering what exactly is a Perrucha: it is not any type of dog, or parrot (as in French), it is simply a term of endearment for those who feel independent, like to explore, to discover (and discover themselves), or what Charli XCX called a Brat. It means someone who is open minded and likes to have fun, and to mix with real people. If you’d like to visit only fancy places, there are other guides for you. When I visit a city, in Perrucha mode, I like to let the city tell a story, of the good and the bad sides, everything that makes it what it is.
As for Athens, you will se it has graffiti, the Acropolis, beautiful museums, sandy beaches, a vibrant music scene, an anarchist neighborhood, and one of the most welcoming people I have ever met. And just wait till you taste the food!
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home. Coming from a Latin American city, I believe it was the mix of beauty and chaos which won me over. Ever since, I’ve felt the need to return and keep exploring. I hope this guide will give you some tips that go beyond the main touristic areas and things to do, the same way I like to share my recommendations with my friends (this way I can also get them to read what I write).
If you are an international traveler, you will probably get to Athens by air -to the international airport Eleftherios Venizelos, commonly initialised as AIA-, or by sea -to Piraeus Port. If you get to the Port, you can easily take Line 3 to the city center, to the airport, or just get a taxi.
Going to the city center from the airport has quickly improved in the past 10 years, now you can just take the line 3 of the metro directly — approximated cost is 9€ per person. A trip to the city center (Syntagma Square), will take approximately 40 minutes. Uber is connected to the Taxi services, which you can also take to and from the airport.
When I first landed in Athens I felt right at home…
You can order taxis via Uber and Freenow (only official taxis exist and use the meter), or take the metro/buses (as the metro won’t take you everywhere). The metro is quite clean and useful to get to and from the international airport.
In the Greek capital, I would say most of the people speak English, and all over Greece the road signs are in both Greek and English, I imagine because Greek is not so popular outside Greece. However, once you move to more retired places, having Google translate (or other apps) comes in handy, even if the younger generations speak English, you may find yourself ordering random items on the menu. In any case, people will most of the times be ready to help you, even if they don’t speak your language.
In short, with a metro card, basic English, and a positive attitude, you can easily move around.
You have two main areas you can choose from: enjoy the historical city center, or stay somewhere closer to the beach.
If you prefer the historical city center, you can try areas such as Plaka and Koukaki, which are walking distance to the Acropolis and full of restaurants and bars. You also have easy access to the metro. This areas are mainly touristic, especially Plaka; I personally prefer Koukaki for its chill vibes and it still walking distance to famous monuments like the Acropolis.
I would avoid areas such as Omonia and Monistiraki, even though they might offer cheaper options, they’re very busy and not as charming as other areas. The same goes for Pireas Port area, it’s not a place to hang out, unless you want to photograph ferries.
On a whole other vibe there is Exarcheia, the anarchist neighborhood. The neighborhood features a maze of architectural styles, bohemian shops, second-hand stores, record shops, and bookstores. Also amazing bars and restaurants for really good prices.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area. Since there is no metro to go there (there might be in the future), the closer you stay to the beach, the cheaper the taxi (duh). If you go further South, you can even visit Vouliagmeni Lake, also worth seeing.
If you prefer the beach (yes, there are beaches in Athens!), you can try Glyfada area.
There is also an option in between the historical city center and the beaches: Paleo Firios, which is walking distance from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, an iconic building housing a library, an opera, a rooftop, and it’s a more residential neighborhood.
First and foremost, in Plaka neighborhood, go all the way up to the Acropolis. In front, instead of paying to enter the museum, which is empty (you can see the pieces in the British or Louvre Museums), just go to the museum restaurant and take pictures from there.
On Sundays see the change of guard in Syntagma Square.
Walk around Monastiraki square. See Filopapo’s hill (Socrates Prison) for the view (Colina Filopappou). If you have extra time you can go up the Mount Likavittos up the hill’s transport.
Walk around Exarcheia (the anarchist neighborhood) and discover the restaurants and cafés in a unique setting.
See Renzo Piano’s Stavros Niarchos Foundation if you can (on your way to Pireas port). The sunset from the rooftop bar is breathtaking. From June to August, you can also enjoy a free Open Air Cinema at night.
I insist for the beach lovers: make sure to check out the Vouliagmeni area, there’s even a Lake with a fancy spa. Most people skip the beaches in Athens, but to me they’re worth the visit, plus, the prices are quite affordable, even for the beach clubs.
There’s the small area of Mikrolimano next to the port with nice restaurants and a gorgeous view.
You can take a day trip to see the Delphos Oracle.
You can buy cosmetic products made with olive oil and honey. Just for the fun, go check out Greek pharmacies, they have the best natural cosmetics, a perfect souvenir.
For sports fans: you can visit the city’s multiple stadiums, be that the Olympic Complex built by renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Olympiacos F.C. Stadium near Pireaus, or the AEK Athens F.C. Agia Sophia Stadium in Nea Filadelfia. The locals I talked to are fervent fans of the AEK Athens F.C. and love the atmosphere.
A plus: a 40-minute drive from Athens, you can visit the APIVITA Cosmetics factory. If you’re my friend, you know I wish they would sponsor me since I use all of their products: they’re made of honey or olive oil. The factory visit is free of charge and you can buy their products at factory prices (located at Markopoulo Mesogaias).
Greece has rich culinary traditions and excellent quality ingredients, so it is not too hard to find good food, coffee and wine wherever you go. In my experience, Athens is one of the best cities in the world for cocktails, the attention to detail and creativity is impressive (also for the prices).
My personal favorites are the following:
· Fried cheese in all forms (cheese beignets, cheese pie)- the cheese can be Feta or Saganaki.
· Eel, squid and fish.
· Eggplant salad (spread).
· Greek salad Saganaki gambas (or anything in Saganaki -red- sauce).
· Mezze: small plates to share.
· Souvlaki (meat on a stick).
· Greek Yogurt with fruits, nuts and honey.
· Iced coffee: Greeks take iced coffee very seriously (as anyone should), hence you will have some of the best iced coffee, no matter the way you order it.
· Alcohol: most beers are pils, for darker beers try micro breweries (mostly in Athens).
· Grape liquors: Ouzo, Raki/Tsipouro — with or without Anis, Masticha, Wines.
Greece is a great place to be a vegetarian or vegan, as they have the well-known Mediterranean diet with fresh cheese, tomatoes, olives, cucumber and olive oil.
· Mpakaliarákia (Greek food) — Kidathineon 41
· Lolos — Geor. Olimpiou 5
· Mikrolimano area (Greek food) — 16, Akti Koumoundourou 24
· Try fried feta cheese with honey, moussaka (like lasagna), souvlaki (meat on a stick). Honestly everything is delicious.
· Drink Raki, Ouzo, Tsipouro (with or without anis), Rakómelo and Mastiha.
· six d.o.g.s — Avramiotou 6–8
· Neratzia Café Bistró (great wine bar) — Zan Moreas 6
· Tranzistor — Protogenous 10
· Baba au rum — Klitiou 6
· Rosalia — Valtetsiou 59
· Bolivar Beach Club — Leof. Poseidonos, Alimos 174 55
· Attic Urban Rooftop — Ermou 86
· Migniardise — Veikou 30
· Plaka is great for shopping for souvenirs such as clothes, magnets, food and cosmetics.
· Syd Records — Protogenous 13
· Athens Tattoo Studio — my favorite artist there is @boss_667ttt
· The prices are competitive, so look for the one closest to you and try it out.
Disclosure: make sure to check the listed places on Google Maps to see if they’re still running.
If you have anything you think I missed, feel free to share in the comments.
Having seen Athens, you can take a ferry and continue your trip to the islands, or take a train or car and see the inner part of the country.

Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP) is the largest water utility in Greece providing services to 4.3 million customers. Read how EYDAP is reducing water-energy nexus pressures.
By Robert C. Brears*
EYDAP has launched an ambitious program of renewable energy utilization with the objective of contributing to the optimization of the energy balance across the country and society and exploring the possibility of expanding to new profitable business. The water utility’s involvement in energy can be grouped into the areas of hydropower, cogeneration of heat and power, solar energy, and energy reduction initiatives.
Hydropower
Along the aqueduct system that brings raw water into the Athens area for treatment there are existing energy dissipation works (small waterfalls along the aqueduct). EYDAP is in process of converting these energy dissipation works into energy production plants, therefore taking advantage of the aqueducts’ hydropower potential. These energy production plants consist of temporarily redirected water flowing through a turbine that converts the hydraulic energy potential into electricity by use of a generator. The water then rejoins the aqueduct at a lower elevation and continues its flow to the water treatment plant. To date, EYDAP has constructed six small hydropower plants along its aqueducts located in Kirfi (760 kW), Elikona (650 kW), Kartala Kihairona (1,200 kW), Mandra (630 kW), Evinos Dam (820 kW), and Klidi (590 kW).
Cogeneration
At Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant, which receives 730,000 m³ of wastewater per day, biogas is captured to produce electricity and thermal energy at the Psyttalia heat and power cogeneration plants, with total wattage being 11.4 MWe and a thermal force of 17.3 MWth.
Solar energy
EYDAP has already licensed production for a photovoltaic power station that generates 1,971 MW on its premises of Aharnes. The contract will enable the selling of electricity to the Hellenic Electricity Officer. In addition, EYDAP is exploring the possibility of constructing smaller photovoltaic plants at other company locations.
Energy conservation
EYDAP has designed an intensive program of energy saving in buildings and facilities including energy inspections and energy saving advice. The utility is also undertaking preventative maintenance to achieve the best possible maintenance and extension of lifetime energy-intensive plant equipment to save energy. The overall aim of EYDAP is to save energy by maximizing the management of existing building equipment without making additional investments with excessive costs.
Multiple benefits
By developing renewable energy systems and undertaking energy conservation measures EYDAP is realizing multiple benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, additional income from trading carbon rights or green certificates, and new employment opportunities.
The take-out
By embracing renewable energy and energy conservation, water utilities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills, all the while offering employment opportunities.

The Greeks planted colonies widely, from Istanbul to Marseilles to Alexandria. And scattered all over the Mediterranean you will find remains of Greek temples (Wikipedia’s (incomplete) list notes 43 of them; it would be a good project for people to add to that list). But which — whether due to their preservation, or their setting, or their architectural value — are the best to visit? We’ve criss-crossed the Mediterranean in pursuit of the best, and we’re happy to share our list with you.
Overshadowed by the more spectacular Acropolis in Athens, the Hephaestion is under-appreciated. One of the very best preserved of all Greek temples (look at that ceiling!), it’s a must-see for any visitor to Athens. Set in a pleasant if slightly bland park — it’s easy to feel disconnected from the urban fabric of Athens here — it’s not difficult to find a shady place to watch the play of light on the temple’s myriad carved surfaces. Long known as the Theseum and a favorite of 19th century artists, it’s a must-see for lovers of ancient architecture.
In school you hear about Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns, but almost all the best-preserved Greek temples are Doric. At Didyma (Didim, in southwest Turkey) you’ll get your best opportunity to appreciate the Ionic: the Temple of Apollo Didymaios. Be prepared to be impressed: the temple’s platform is almost 400 feet long, and supported an incredible forest of 116 columns each more than six feet in diameter and 60 feet high. Admiring what is left, you begin to grasp the first reason why we have so little of the Ionic: these temples were lofty, ambitious structures. Sixty-foot columns don’t typically stand earthquakes, and when they fall, they shatter. But the Ionic style isn’t only to be admired for its size. These are some of the most elegant, beautiful ruins you will ever see: giant Medusa-heads watch over the ruins, exquisite reliefs ring the column bases, and everything is made of a gleaming marble whose beauty you have to see to believe. The vast temple enclosed an open-air court, where were kept a spring and laurel sacred to Apollo. Bring your Herodotus with you: the sanctuary — generally referred to as “Branchidae” by Herodotus, for the family that maintained the temple — was a key player in the Ionian Revolt, and Father of History recounts all the steps that led to its destruction in 494 B.C.
Delphi, easily reached from Athens, is one of the most touristed places in Greece. But it’ll take a lot more visitors to ruin this incredible mountain sanctuary. Tucked away in a valley the Greeks thought resembled a uterus (delphus), it’s still one of the most spectacular religious sites in the world. The views alone are worth the trip. And while the actual structure of the temple probably won’t overwhelm you, the significance of the place, and the weight of so much emotional human history — for centuries, people came here in the thousands literally looking for answers — still can be felt today. The famed objects are almost all gone — the wooden staff offered by Brutus, Rome’s first consul, or the rich gifts left by Croesus — but reading Pausanias’s account of them all will serve to remind you that this little mountain village was in many ways the spiritual center of the ancient world.
If you think Delphi’s mountain scenery is spectacular, wait til you try a visit to Bassae, a truly remote Greek temple atop a mountain literally in the middle of Arcadia. Most of the year you’ll probably have the place pretty much to yourself, too — if you can get there (it’s accessible only by car or by an expensive taxi). It may be the best-preserved Greek temple in the world, and as such has been the subject of much academic study (and the first to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Supposedly designed by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon, this temple’s beauty and harmony were singled out for praise by Pausanias almost two thousand years ago. And just to see those columns, still standing on that summit after all these centuries, is enough to give the pious traveller chills. The interior frieze was carted off to the British Museum in 1814, where you can still admire it (Mary Beard and John Henderson made the frieze the starting-point for their 2000 volume, Classics: A Very Short Introduction, a suitable companion for your journey in Arcadia).
This site might well have taken the top spot on our list were it not for the fact that in 1987 an enterprising preservationist decided the temple needed to be protected, and that the right way to protect it was to put it beneath a gargantuan latex tent. As you drive up the winding road it appears that the mountain is now crowned not by an extraordinary ancient temple but something rather like a Cyclops’ discarded condom. The temporary structure — which is remarkable-looking on the inside, I will confess — has now been there for almost thirty years. To make matters worse, at times the “preservation works” inside take up all the area inside the tent, and visitors are allowed to visit only the front face of the temple. What was once perhaps the most spectacular place in all Greece is now at times almost completely off limits. Not only that, but the tent has spawned a whole brood of conspiracy theories (“what exactly are they hiding up there? ALIENS?”). But a trip up to this three-thousand-foot-high ridge is to see just how spectacular the Greek architectural imagination could be.
The mountains of Greece are remarkable, but when you think of Greece, you think first and foremost of the sea. The most glorious religious manifestation of this is the temple of Poseidon at Sounion. On a sea-girt promontory jutting into the Aegean, almost every ship bound for Athens came within sight of this clifftop shrine. The structure is decidedly ruinous, but the spectacular setting is forever memorable (as is the signature from Byron carved into one of the pillars). The site history is not complex here — there has been the temple and the sea and the rock and not much else. On summer evenings a crowd gathers at the temple to watch the sunset, with a pleasant holiday vibe. It’s touristy, but the spot is still appreciably wild: I’ve hiked all over the promontory and even camped out there to get a little time alone with the beach.
Cumae is the place where Daedalus landed (without Icarus) after flying away from the Labyrinth, and his wings were supposedly kept in the temple of Apollo there. There’s not much left of the temple today — just the foundations — but the location on an abandoned hillside in Italy overlooking the Mediterranean is second to none. It’s the setting of Book Six of the Aeneid too, and reading Vergil’s lines on-location at the temple will give you shivers. Factor in the remarkable cave structure there, the Roman roads climbing the acropolis, and the temples of Zeus and Artemis nearby, and this is one of the best archaeological sites in the whole Mediterranean. It’s undiscovered too — the crowds all head to Pompeii and Naples just to the south.
Selinunte is one of a trio of top-notch Greek temple sites in Sicily (the other two are Segesta and Agrigento), all of which make our list. On a high plain overlooking the sea and flanked by golden beaches, it’s pretty easy to have a good time at Selinunte: mornings with the temples, afternoons at the beach, and evenings at the clubs. Not only that, but Selinunte boasts five major temple structures and several minor ones sprawling over the largest archaeological park in Italy. “Temple E” (generally presumed to be a temple of Hera) makes for the best pictures — it was re-erected using the original stones — but the whole site is interesting, especially if you can get there before temperatures start to soar.
Once the home of the great warrior Ajax, Aegina, just across the Saronic Gulf from Athens, doesn’t get the love that the more distant Greek islands get, but this temple of the mysterious “disappeared” Earth goddess Aphaia (aphaia means “not appearing”) is something special. It sits atop a hill overlooking the sea, on a quiet part of the island far away from the crowds. The temples of the Acropolis and Sounion are actually visible from here, and there may have been some kind of communication in antiquity from temple to temple with watchfires. The panorama is all big sky, old stone, and blue sea, an essence of Greece refined up through twenty-five hundred years. The temple itself is Doric, from around 500 B.C., and the sculptures from its pediment — now in Munich — stand, like the temple itself, right in that happy borderland between the Archaic Greek period and the full Classical style.
Strolling through the flowery hillsides, you might find it hard to imagine that Segesta once was a city. Almost nothing of the place remains, a fact which makes its two principal ruins all the more striking: an impressively preserved stone theater and an even more perfectly preserved Doric temple. You start by the temple, its unfluted columns aging to the color of sand and ochre; the Sicilian sun marks time’s every stroke upon the stone with a casting of shadow; landscaped grounds display the sun-loving Sicilian vegetation. A half-mile walk up the hill brings you to the theater, cunningly built as most of them are, splendidly preserved and following the line of the hill. Turning back to see the temple set among fields, with the waters of the Mediterranean in the distance and even further beyond, the endless hills of Sicily, you get one of the world’s most picturesque views. Thomas Cole selected precisely this view to produce one of his best Grand Tour keepsake paintings. Past and present seem to join hands here. Even today the temple looks almost brand-new, as if a team of builders threw it up in the past month and have just gone home for the day before coming back tomorrow to put on the roof and give it a final paintjob.
We know, we know, we know: the crowds can be awful, the sun is so glaring your eyes start watering without sunglasses, it’s beastly hot in summer, and parts of the place get roped off for no apparent reason. But it’s the Parthenon, and there’s a reason the crowds keep showing up. The most iconic image of Ancient Greece, the temple of Athena Parthenos is still a standout among Greek temples, for its incredible position at the center of Greece’s greatest city, for the Doric proportions perfectly poised between airy elegance and stony heft, for the gorgeous Pentelic marble that seems to mirror the color of the sun in the sky — pink at sunrise, blinding white at midday, honey-colored in the afternoon — and because it’s the Parthenon. This is the chief monument of “the school of Hellas,” the tangible remainder of Periclean Athens. It’s hard not to be impressed when you’re there. And there’s the rest of the Acropolis to see too — from the Erechtheum on top to the theater of Dionysus below (yes, that theater). There’s a reason why this is all a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You’re better off going off-season, but no one who loves Greek temples is going to want to miss this one.
The Italians have chutzpah, and at times it pays off. The temples at Paestum, just south of the Amalfi Coast, face onto a road. There are businesses along the road: a few hotels, a few restaurants, a few bars. This could be a disaster. But it’s not: it’s delightful, and it makes visiting Paestum a real pleasure. The last time I was there I visited a bar where couples and friends were lined up at tables just staring at the sun setting over the Temple of Athena. It seemed like some kind of perfect dream of Mediterranean life. And it’s Italy: the restaurants are fabulous (they’re famous for their mozzarella di bufala), the bars are fabulous. There’s even a hair salon with a temple view. And the temples themselves? They are perfect. Their names have changed over generations, but the one now known as the Temple of Poseidon is one of the standout works of antiquity. The etching Piranesi completed of it — perfectly capturing the mystery of all things old — is perhaps the master’s greatest work. That Paestum comprises multiple temples, that they are so accessible, that there are perfect vantage points from which to draw or contemplate them, that the beach is so close, that the walls of the city form another remarkable attraction reachable by short walks through the fields, that they are visited but not overcrowded, that the place is easily accessed from the train — all these things make a visit to Paestum one of the very best ways to experience Greek temple architecture.
Grand as all the temple sites of Magna Grecia are — Paestum, Segesta, and Selinunte are all on this list — the grandest of them all is Agrigento, the ancient Akragas, where a walk through a grove of almond and olive leads you from magnificent Greek temple to magnificent Greek temple, all of them perched on an impossibly photogenic ridge. The site is hot in summer but truly beautiful all throughout the year, thanks to the warm climate, sea views, and some gorgeous Mediterranean landscaping. The bloom of the almond trees in February is particularly stunning, and the wonderful spread of the site makes it a perfect botanical garden — it’s almost as if the ancients spaced out their temples to cater to the tourist experience.
The so-called Temple of Concordia is the star attraction, a splendidly preserved Doric temple in a warm buff stone, but the site boasts seven temples, all of which are worth visiting, and much besides: the remains of an “Atlas,” part of the temple of Zeus, shows its utterly unique temple design. Alone of all the Greek sites in Italy, the Valley of the Temples has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status. The adjacent town of Agrigento is a kind of miniature Sicily in itself, with ancient, medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and modern buildings in a kind of glorious jumble. Olives, sunshine, sculpture, blossom, wine-dark sea, history laid upon history: if you want to get the experience of an ancient Greek temple, it’s pretty hard to beat Agrigento.
You don’t have to choose just one, of course. The best is to find a way to see them all. Have a favorite we left off our list? Feel free to add it in the comments.

(TW: Sexual Assault. Please read with care. Thank you.)
There were none wiser, stronger, or better than her, Athena, the Goddess of wisdom and strength, knew. Victory flowed fresh in her blood of gold — ichor. She had just won the battle of being the patron God of Athens and won from whom but her uncle, the God of the Waters himself! However, she knew Poseidon’s propensity to hold grudges. An attack could be on the way anytime soon. The caution did not stop her from savoring her spoils as her hungry eyes wandered over the capital, looking for a new conquest to engage her. Mortals could be the most entertaining species. Amidst the cacophony of the cosmopolitan city — hawkers crying, officials announcing, and buyers haggling, a mellifluous voice struck her ears.
“Goddess Athena!”
Few things managed to take Athena aback. The woman’s beauty happened to be one of them. Long, golden hair tumbled on her dusky face, which was adorned with a dainty nose and full, red lips. Her white robe contrasted against her skin. The woman was kneeling in the exquisitely built temple of marble, which had been devoted to the Goddess. The mortal continued to heap praises. Well aware of the protocol, the golden-haired maiden stood and draped an embroidered silver robe on Athena’s statue. Divine rays emanated from the statue as Athena deigned to appear in the temple.
“Goddess!” the woman gasped, falling on her knees.
“Rise, maiden.” Athena’s rich, deep voice reverberated in the temple. “What is your name, and whence do you come from?”
“Medusa is my name,” the mortal’s silky voice said. “I am the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto, minor lords of the sea.”
Athena’s eyes hardened. “Lords of the sea, you say?”
“The sea, Goddess. But I am here to devote my heart and soul to your service. I want to be the first priestess of this temple.”
Medusa looked into Athena’s eyes. A sudden current passed in the space between them. The mortal must have felt the exchange of sparks too, for she looked away, red rushing to her cheeks. Athena noticed the blueness of those frail mortal eyes — eyes that were bluer than the sky and deeper than the ocean. Yet, another factor attracted her. Those eyes seemed to contain intelligence and consideration more than most men.
“Answer me, then. What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?”
Medusa did not take time to think. “The answer should be a human. In the morning of life — our childhood — we crawl on all fours. At noon, which is adulthood, we walk upright on two legs. In the evening of our lives, we use a cane as a third leg.”
“Born of the earth, yet a gift divine,I thrive where the sun and soil align.A token of peace, a feast I provide,In oil or fruit, I’m prized worldwide.What am I?”
Medusa smiled in recognition. “Your gift to us, Goddess, what else? The people of Athens chose this over Poseidon’s salt water. They are your divinely provided olives.”
Athena continued to grill the woman — on policy, on Gods, on anthropology. Each answer seemed better than the previous and drew Athena closer, till she could hear the mortal’s breaths. Athena knew her presence overwhelmed mortals, yet the maiden held her ground.
“Last question for today,” Athena said.
“I cannot be seen, yet I color your view,I cannot be touched, yet I’m felt through and through.I can bind the mighty, or make the meek bold,A treasure eternal, yet never bought or sold.What am I?”
Athena watched Medusa’s lips as she spoke. “The answer is love, Goddess. The best and the worst feeling in the world.”
A rush of power hit Athena; a unique exhilaration and euphoria made their way to her heart. She could appreciate beauty with brains; she could appreciate a challenge. Medusa remained on her knees, awaiting the judgment.
“Call an official,” said Athena. “I have an important announcement to make.”
And so, one of Athena’s first and grandest temples in Athens got the perfect priestess. The duties, the offerings, and the devotion were at a level unseen by Athena before. At the dawn of every week’s first day, Athena used to appear in the temple to meet the priestess. The Goddess posed riddles, discussed the recent developments in Olympus, or simply shared silence with the mortal. Those times energized the Goddess more than ambrosia could. During those conversations, butterflies flew in Athena’s stomach, and she could see the yearning in the mortal’s eyes. For the time being, she decided to keep her distance and tease the mortal some more. The bountiful sparks added a new flavor to her life.
She looked forward to them eagerly.
Medusa swayed her way to the temple from her home. The sun was rising, the sea reflecting the sky’s oranges and pinks beautifully. A smile touched her lips. Maybe, today would be the day that Athena would close the distance between them. Perhaps Athena was waiting for her to make the move. After all, who would appreciate bravado more than her?
Today, Medusa decided. Today I would say it all.
Just then, drizzle began. Medusa increased her pace, knowing the temple was still a stretch away. Her gut was pounding. A shadow fell on her shoulder. The scent of salt water hit her nose.
“Young lady,” said a hoarse voice. “I have seen none finer than you.”
Medusa turned and gasped. A muscular man with blue robes and dark, long hair towered over her. Yet, he looked more ugly than desirable to her. She clutched her white robe, which told the world that she was devoted to Athena.
“God Poseidon,” Medusa managed to say. “T-thank you for your compliments. I was headed to Goddess Athena’s temple.”
Medusa immediately knew that was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone in Poseidon’s eyes. As he took a step forward, she took a step back, her hands quivering.
Athena, she prayed, over and over. Athena.
Clouds grew darker over her. Huge waves began forming in the sea and crashing over the coast. It seemed that the God grew in size. Medusa fell backwards. Her heart pounded loudly.
“Are you denying the chance to be with me, young lady? Isn’t your name Medusa? Aren’t you the daughter of minor lords under ME?”
“Have mercy,” Medusa said, slithering backwards. “Mercy, Lord, I apologize, I am already devoted to Goddess Athena. ATHENA.”
Thunder crackled. Poseidon fell on her, twisting her arm, making her turn over. Medusa went numb. A golden light flashed somewhere. Poseidon cursed. Momentarily, the weight was removed from her. Through her tears and blood, Medusa saw two great lights clashing. A shrill shriek dominated the air. In horror, she realized Poseidon was coming towards her again as a wounded beast. She tried to stand. A force other than Poseidon hit her then, throwing her back. Poseidon cursed again, his shout shaking the ground. A cold, brutal wave crashed on her. The last thing Medusa was aware of was Athena’s tear-stricken face.
It seemed that she had been unconscious for ages. The ground was hard below, and there was a constant hissing around. When the memories set in, Medusa sat up straight and horrified.
Was it a dream?
She found herself in a cave overlooking the sea. Looking around, she was shocked to see her cousins — the Gorgons — sleeping in the corner. Perhaps Athena had made them guard her. They had their hair as hundreds of tiny snakes, their faces grey and what was generally considered monstrous. The hissing of their snakes filled her head. There was a small pool of water on the other end of the cave. Feeling the thirst, Medusa wandered towards it. Her reflection was not something she was prepared for. That was why the hissing sounded too loud. Her scream was loud enough to disturb the sea.When her throat could scream no more, her ears caught the sound of sobbing. Even without turning, Medusa knew who the person was. Pain like no other twisted in her heart.
“Medusa,” said Athena, her voice cracking. Medusa turned. When once those blue eyes glittered at the sight of the Goddess, now there was only blankness.
Medusa opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. She closed her eyes, hot tears splashing on her cheeks. Whatever had happened had to be a dream. Soon, her body was rocked by hefty sobs. Athena kept apologizing in the background, her eyes as red and swollen.
“If only I had claimed you sooner,” said Athena. “Would that have made a difference?” The Goddess crawled closer to Medusa, whom she had transformed into another Gorgon. “I am sorry, Medusa. I am sorry. I love you. This seemed the only viable solution to drive Poseidon away.” The Goddess gulped. “I could not defeat him.”
Looking at Medusa’s defeated face, Athena grabbed her shoulders, her voice betraying the pain she felt. “Tell me.
“I linger unseen, a shadow in light,I burden the heart, both day and night.I grow with your secrets, thrive on your pain,I bind you in chains, yet leave no stain.What am I?”
Medusa finally stared in the grey eyes. “Guilt.”
Slowly, legends about Medusa spread.
Some of them claimed that she could turn people into stone just by looking at them. Heroes began to seek her out, to win the confidence and support of people around. Medusa’s peaceful life began to be poked at again, by men. Athena knew she had to do something. Every time she thought of the incident, a knife twisted in her chest. Soon, a quiet trip to Hades was made. As depressing and spooky as the underworld was, Athena knew it was the path to Medusa’s salvation. Hades was hard to bargain with, but the presence of Persephone helped. Promptly, two gilded swords that held the power to never miss a strike were transported to Hades. His part of the bargain would come later.
In the meanwhile, a young and promising hero named Perseus, the son of Zeus, was rising in popularity.
One night, Athena paid a visit to him and whispered his task. He had to behead Medusa as painlessly as possible and bring the head to the Goddess. Perseus did not question the specifics and accepted a shield for the task, a shield that shone brighter than gold, that reflected better than a mirror. The hero set off. Athena helped him whenever she could without making it obvious, until he reached the infamous Rock Island.
Athena watched with bated breath.
The day of the final encounter arrived. Perseus entered the cave in the middle of the day. That was usually the time when the Gorgons slept. The statues of people around did not help his nerves. He gripped the shield tightly, a royal sword hanging by his waist, and tiptoed where Medusa slept. The unevenness of the ground made him fumble. He tripped, making the other statues around him crash to the ground. Then, it was deathly silent. His heart stopped as he heard the snarl of Medusa, the hissing of her snakes.
The moment she turned to him, he lifted the shield.
Medusa faltered. Perseus, his eyes closed, swung his sword, praying his strike was right. He heard a thing plop to the ground. Daring to look up, he saw the headless body of Medusa collapsing. The other Gorgons came for him, but Perseus made a dash, dodging over the fallen statues, managing to take the head of Medusa with him.
When the hero was back in his kingdom, Athena paid a visit to him. Perseus handed over the head and the shield back as promised.
After blessing him, she returned to her abode. In the space of her own, she fused the head of her lover with the shield. As she did the task, she knew it would be one of the deadliest weapons. Any ill-intentioned onlooker would be turned to stone through its use. A maiden in trouble could lift the weapon and fight off the attacker easily. Athena went on to keep it safely in the temple where Medusa had reigned for months.
Guilt still weighed heavy in Athena’s chest — no longer did she feel as mighty or as wise.
Yet, Medusa’s hearty afterlife in Elysium — courtesy of Hades — managed to ease some of it. After three attempts of visiting her, Medusa had finally made conversation with her. It had been short, but it was the only thing that had healed some part of Athena.
“Athena,” Medusa had said.
“I am a bridge that mends the torn,A balm where wounds and pain are born.I free the heart, untie the chain,And bring the sun through clouds of rain.
What am I?”
Athena had bowed her head to the spirit, experiencing the bittersweetness of the moment. “Medusa, the woman who opened my eyes and my heart, the answer is forgiveness.”

No other ancient city is as alive for us as Athens at the time of Socrates. Written sources are plentiful, and we do have a lot of Archaeological evidence — especially remarkable are the painted ceramics, showing the inhabitants of Athens in their houses, at the gymnasium, at war and all their other activities. All this allows us to use Plato’s Dialogues as a guide: skipping over the philosophical discussions, together with Socrates, we stroll through the city and enter the houses of its inhabitants.
Socrates reports: ‘At the earliest stages of dawn, Hippocrates came and started beating at my door with his stick; a slave opened the door for him, and he came rushing in and yelled out: Socrates, are you awake or asleep? [Hippocrates brings the news that Protagoras is in town and wants to visit him right away.] ‘Let’s not go there now, my good friend, it’s too early. But let’s go out into the courtyard here and spend the time until sunrise strolling around out…

A walk through history as you tour mill ruins, historic homes, and a battleground at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site.
The site is located about three hours north of St. Louis near the Iowa border.
We first stopped at the former Athens, Mo., General Store. The building is open to the outdoors and now serves as a picnic shelter. Inside you can read signs that describe the history of the store. It was once at the corner of Spring and Thome Street along a path that went down to the ferry that once crossed the Des Moines River.
A nearby sign shows the town at its height from 1853–1860 when it was an important port along the river pre-Civil War.
Next, we saw a monument explaining that the Battle of Athens on Aug. 5, 1861, was the northernmost Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River.
First, a short history lesson to better understand what happened here. Athens prospered until the outbreak of the Civil War. Settled by people from the upper South. Considered by Unionists to be a hotbed of pro-South sentiment. As the spring of 1861 moved into summer, northeast Missourians began choosing sides in the ever-widening national conflict.
Pro-Unionists rallied around David Moore, who had raised a force of about 500 men. Moore entered and occupied Athens on July 24, seizing homes and businesses from pro-South supporters to quarter and provision his troops. Pro-South supporters rallied around Col. Martin Green. Green raised a force of about 3,000 men, including two of Moore’s sons.
The confrontation between Moore’s and Green’s forces took place in Athens on Aug. 5, 1861. The battle began around 5 a.m. Moore and his Unionists were surrounded on three sides by Green’s troops, with the Des Moines River to their rear.
Despite being outnumbered at least five to one, Moore’s men were better trained and equipped.
After about two hours of fighting, at least 50 soldiers had been wounded or killed and the pro-South side was demoralized and in full retreat.
The big loser in the battle was the town of Athens. Bitter feelings between neighbors continued for decades following the Civil War. Athens was also hurt by the shift from the river to railroad transportation in the post-war era. By 1900, the once-thriving town was nearly gone.
(From the Battle of Athens State Historic Site website)
Along a former road, we went by a white picket fence surrounding a foundation. In front, a sign explains what happened after the battle.
A sign in front of the Benning House talks about the forming of Union troops in Northeast Missouri.
We happened to be up at the Battle of Athens State Historic Site when they were conducting tours so the historic homes were open to the public. I would call first to see if they are doing tours before you drive to the site if you want to see the inside of them.
Bedrooms are set up to that period including chamber pots, beds, a chest of drawers, and cabinets along with stoves.
My son pointed out the large piano and a nearby violin.
Fascinating were the intricate details of the patchwork quilt with ducks and even an 1800s girl with schoolbooks.
We then saw the large apple peeler at the end of a cabinet in the kitchen.
The most intriguing aspect of the house is the hole a cannonball left through the kitchen door, through the kitchen, and out the other wall. Although the cannonball harmed no one.
The cannonball fired from the artillery of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard hit the house during the Aug. 5, 1861 battle.
Next, we walked up the road to the Smith Hotel.
Here we found a weaver machine from the 1800s.
A corkboard had photos from the 1800s giving you a sense of the people and houses that were in the town back then.
Andrew checked out the rifles and guns on display.
Next, we walked out to the back where a large cannon is set up on the former battleground. Andrew stood in the back like he was about to fire it.
Then we walked over by the brick Moreland House and Wm. S. French House, abandoned homes in the town.
Next, we went down to the sign for the Mill Trail, which says it is a .3-mile one-way walk. Although, you can do it as a loop since the trail curves back up the hill a short way after passing the mill. This is also shown on the printout of the Mill Trail from the historic site’s website. The total walk is a .4-mile natural surface loop.
Heading down the wide mowed path we pass a ravine that goes into trees.
I spy a white mushroom growing on part of a log.
Below the hill, the trail goes to the left and we saw the brown rock mill remains. These remnants were from a mill constructed by Edward Colton. Built to withstand ice and flooding and stood on a 30-foot stone foundation with an additional four stores and had a water wheel. It was a grist and textile mill until the 1890s.
After checking out the mill we walked a short way along the river before coming to a trail that headed back up the hillside. You could continue along the river, but this is an unlisted trail.
At the top, you can take the White Connector trail to the 2.8-mile natural surface Snow Trillium Trail that goes along the river hills.
We headed back up into the former town to check out the Athens Mill Overlook boardwalk.
This is a good way to see the mill site without having to go down and up the river hill.
Along the boardwalk, you can also see remains of brown rock structures in the woods.
If you like history and ghost towns then this is a worthy trip to make if you are in northeast Missouri. A lot of history in a small area.
A fishing lake, picnic areas, and a playground.
Call 660–877–3871 for more information or to schedule a tour.
Drive: A little over three hour’s drive from the St. Louis Metro. Take Interstate 64 or Interstate 70 to U.S. 61 and go north. North of Wayland, Mo., make a left onto Missouri Highway C then a right onto Missouri Highway 81, and then a right onto Missouri Highway CC that leads to the historic site.
Hours: 7 a.m. — sunset, daily, year-round
Address: State Hwy CC, Revere, MO 63465
A national Civil War battlefield, a frog-shaped rock, and a devil’s elbow are some of what can be seen on the way from St. Louis to Branson!
Dennis Schick Trail includes historic sites and war machinery such as a World War II Sherman Tank in Jefferson Barracks Park in St. Louis County.
If you are heading up to Iowa City from St. Louis another stop is the Swinging Bridge in Columbus Junction, Iowa.
In Columbus Junction, Iowa, you can walk along a swinging bridge that is 262 feet above a dark ravine shrouded in a jungle-like forest.

Athens
Athens, Greece; June 13, 2019
Where to start. It’s so vulnerable to put writing– my ideas materialized for literally anyone to read– out on the internet. Yet, I feel like I need to start blogging. I mean, one day, this will be amazing to read and remember all the details of my life that are so present now. But not only that. I hope you guys (even if the only person reading is my mom) enjoy what you read and take something away from this.
OK. Time to get into what you’re here to read. Greece. Honestly, Greece is a logistical nightmare. Now, don’t get me wrong. Actually being in Greece is incredible. But, the getting there… now that’s a headache. Flying anywhere in Europe is an 8 hour flight or more– that’s a given. But to get to Santorini, it takes a flight from Nashville to New York and then another flight to Athens and then a ferry to the island. That adds up to be almost 24 hours of travel straight. A logistical nightmare. Planning the flights and ferries, doing time change and travel time math… needless to say we were exhausted when we arrived in Athens that first day. We had our ferry to Mykonos booked for the next morning, planning to spend one night in Athens to split up the day of travel. But, when in Athens, you have to visit the Parthenon. So what did we do that day? We visited the Parthenon.
Nashville’s Parthenon had not prepared me for the hike up to and the heat that encompassed the Grecian Parthenon. It was in the upper 90s when we went to the Parthenon, and I was sweating buckets. The Parthenon is on top of this huge peak in Athens, which is amazing in the sense that at the top, you can see a 360* view of the city. But on the other hand, the peak is that much closer to the sun, making walking around on the pavement surrounding the Parthenon feel like you are cooking on a hot grill. The view at the top was insane. Humbling. We could see the entire city below us, seeing the true insignificance of ourselves in the grand scheme of life. Yet, I also felt so important in that moment. The fact that I had traveled so many miles and was lucky enough to experience such an out-of-body moment in the most beautiful country I’d ever been, with the people I loved the most- it was a feeling I can’t find the words to describe.
We made our way down the mountainside (is it a mountain? I don’t really know… maybe a really big hill?) to find ourselves famished. In Europe, the restaurants operate way different from American ones. For one, there are rows and rows of restaurants directly next to each other, all with menus out front and all outdoor seating. Imagine Downtown Franklin, but no indoor seating and all the tables extended into the sidewalk. Also, you have to sit suuuuuper close to the people next to you in Europe when you eat. These are both due to the lack of space and expensive real estate in European cities. See, there are no skyscrapers in Europe; the restaurants are in original buildings. So, when searching for a restaurant, you can see the entire thing from the street and you kind of know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.
We walked down street upon street of crowded restaurants, searching for one that could accommodate the 5 of us and seemed to serve ~gluten free and vegan~ food. We finally found this one, which was literally the first one we saw and somehow skipped. This restaurant was at the foot of the Parthenon, with an incredible view of the Acropolis from below. (It’s called Athina Bistrot, if any of you are ever in Athens and need an amazing restaurant!) We were seated among locals, all of whom were enjoying casual coffee and business meetings amidst our day of tourism.
Another thing about Europe: they don’t serve you water. Ok, that’s dramatic. They do serve you water. But not in the way American restaurants do. Let’s take dinner at Cheesecake Factory for example. You sit and the waiter brings you a glass of water initially, refills when they bring you bread, refills when getting your food order, and again fills your glass when the food comes. And that’s not even including dessert. But in Europe, you have to ask for water and for refills. And the water comes from a glass bottle they leave at your table to refill. And here’s the catch: they charge you for each bottle. So, it is likely that one is dehydrated the majority of the time they are abroad. That being said, my family finished six. Let me repeat. Six bottles of water. Before we had even been served. We were parched–to say the least. Our waiter and the others dining in the restaurant found us comical- the group of 5 American tourists guzzling down upwards of $30 in water.
Our waiter. The reason I am writing this today. Actually, he and I are friends on Facebook so he may see this. So, if you’re reading this, Nikitas– hey! Nikitas was quite the conversationalist. His English was really good, so we were able to chat with him whilst inhaling our Greek salads. Every so often, I would look over into the kitchen to see Nikitas looking fondly at my family.
Every few minutes, Nikitas would come over to our table to check on us and start up a conversation about everything– to life in America and what we had planned for our trip. Here’s another thing about Europe that’s important to know here: they don’t give you the check. Again, I’m being dramatic. They do give you the check. But, in America, the minute you finish eating your food, they give you the check. This table turnover is the way American restaurants operate. The sooner they get you in and out, the more tables they can seat and the more tips they can make. But in Europe, they don’t give you the check immediately, you have to ask for it. European culture centers around eating and community, so the waitstaff don’t rush you out. Secondly, the restaurants in Europe stay open until the early morning hours, so there is not really a rush from the waiters to kick each table out. That being said, we sat at that table for hours sipping on our bottled waters and chatting with Nikitas.
Towards the end of our meal, Nikitas came by again. This time, he told us about his life. He was a single father raising his son, a son he saw as his world. He told us about the countless hours he worked just to make sure his son was well cared for. When Nikitas talked about his son, his eyes sparkled and he beamed. He opened up about how he envied the closeness of our family and how he loved seeing us together, happy.
That one hit home. I realized the true value of the moment I was living. I had all of my family together, at one table, in the most beautiful country, and here’s the kicker. We were happy. I began to think about how this moment was fleeting. Some day I would look back on this moment with such nostalgia, such joy. I felt a twinge of sadness, I knew I would miss this moment and I was currently living in it. Nostalgia for the present is such a powerful thing. I missed this moment before it was even over.
This idea taught me to hold on much tighter to what I experience that is good. I now feel as though I collect moments and memories, rather than let them pass idly by. I have grown to miss moments whilst living them, knowing the exact laughs and conversations are irreplaceable. And after my whole life, not stopping to realize the impermanence memories, it took Nikitas, a waiter in Athens to teach me. I took that lesson and ran. I lived that trip with the intention to remember and cherish every moment.
We left Athens the next morning and embarked on two weeks of Grecian life in Mykonos and Santorini. And trust me, the stories I have about the rest of the trip will be told in their entirety on future blog posts… Get excited ;)
Back to logistics. A ferry back to Athens was the first leg of the trip back home to Nashville. Again, we stayed in Athens for a night before we took a flight to New York and then another one to Nashville. When we arrived in Athens, I knew there was one thing I wanted to do. Eat at that restaurant.
My family and I made our way back to the restaurant he worked at– hoping he would be our waiter again. He was there. A reminder of the fleeting nature of the present and the necessity of cherishing every moment.

Athens is an iconic city with a huge history. I’ve always dreamed of going there and this article will help you enjoy this.
Also, remember that I’m also writing on Medium and that it is very important for me growing a huge community over here so please go and follow my channel with this link : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Athens, the capital of Greece, is a dynamic metropolis in southeastern Europe. With an area of around 39 km², it is relatively small compared to other European capitals, but its cultural and historical wealth makes it a place of exceptional importance.
In 2021, Athens had a population of around 664,046, making it Greece’s most populous city. It is the country’s political, economic and cultural center. The city is famous for its emblematic ancient monuments, including the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the ancient Agora, which bear witness to its rich historical heritage.
Athens is divided into several districts, but has no official arrondissements like some other metropolises. The city has a complex administrative organization, with subdivisions such as districts, municipalities and suburbs.
Geopolitically, Athens is of strategic importance due to its geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea. It plays a central role in Greece’s politics and economy, as well as in the region’s international relations. The city is home to numerous government institutions, embassies and international organizations.
In addition to its historical heritage, Athens is also renowned for its Mediterranean cuisine, lively neighborhoods, colorful markets and vibrant nightlife. Visitors can explore its museums, theaters and art galleries, as well as enjoy the breathtaking views from the Acropolis hill.
Athens, with its fascinating blend of past and present, is a must for travelers seeking history, culture and the excitement of a major European city.
Athens has a rich history stretching back thousands of years, with roots deeply rooted in Greek mythology. Here’s a summary of key moments in the city’s history from its legendary beginnings.
Athens takes its name from the Greek goddess Athena, who is said to have won a contest with Poseidon to become the city’s protector. According to legend, she gave the city an olive tree, a symbol of peace and prosperity, and thus Athens was born.
The first traces of human occupation in Athens date back to the Bronze Age, around 3000 BC. At that time, it was a small farming community.
Athens developed during the Archaic period (800–500 BC), becoming a powerful city-state with a system of government based on nascent democracy.
The 5th century BC is often referred to as Athens’ Golden Age. Under the leadership of Pericles, the city flourished culturally, politically and economically. It was during this period that monuments such as the Parthenon were built.
Athens played a crucial role in the Median Wars (490–479 BC), repelling the Persian invasion and consolidating its position in Greece.
Athens was embroiled in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), a devastating conflict with its rival Sparta. This war weakened Athenian power.
In 338 BC, Athens fell under the domination of Philip II of Macedon, then his son, Alexander the Great.
After the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens lost some of its political importance, but became a cultural center of the Roman Empire.
Under the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, Athens continued to be a prosperous city, although it suffered barbarian invasions and unrest over the centuries.
From the 15th century onwards, Athens fell under Ottoman domination, a period that lasted until the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century.
The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) led to the liberation of Athens and the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830.
Contemporary times: Since independence, Athens has become the capital of Greece, playing a key role in the country’s political, cultural and economic development. It hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has continued to thrive as a cultural and intellectual center.
Today, Athens remains a crossroads of history and culture, bearing witness to its long and fascinating history from its modest mythological beginnings to its status as a dynamic, modern metropolis.
Athens is packed with historic, cultural and picturesque sites to discover as a tourist. Here are ten must-see places to visit when you’re in Athens:
This is Athens’ most emblematic site, home to the majestic Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Theater of Dionysus. The Acropolis offers a panoramic view of the city.
This historic site is home to ancient temples, stelae and monuments. It was the heart of public life in Athens in ancient times.
This world-renowned museum displays an impressive collection of artifacts and sculptures from the Acropolis, providing a valuable backdrop to a visit to the site itself.
Watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony in front of the Parliament building on Syntagma Square. The building itself is a magnificent example of neoclassical architecture.
Explore the winding, picturesque streets of Plaka, one of Athens’ most charming districts, with its boutiques, tavernas and colorful houses.
This museum houses a vast collection of ancient artifacts, including sculptures, jewelry and archaeological treasures, offering a comprehensive overview of Greek history.
Climb to the top of this hill for breathtaking panoramic views of Athens, especially at sunset.
Visit this lively district for its flea market, cafés, vintage stores and the famous Monastiraki square.
Discover this ancient marble stadium, which was restored to host the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
If you have time, take a trip outside Athens to admire the temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, located on the seafront and offering spectacular views of the Aegean Sea.
These sites offer a comprehensive overview of the history, culture and beauty of Athens, giving you an unforgettable experience in this fascinating city.
A world-renowned Greek philosopher, Plato was the founder of the Academy of Athens, one of the world’s first institutions of higher learning. His philosophical dialogues, notably “The Republic”, have influenced Western thought for centuries.
A pupil of Plato, Aristotle was another renowned philosopher from Athens. His contributions to philosophy, biology, politics and metaphysics had a lasting impact on many disciplines.
Athenian historian, Thucydides is the author of “The Peloponnesian War”, a detailed account of the war between Athens and Sparta. His work is considered a masterpiece of history and politics.
An influential Greek politician, Venizelos was Prime Minister of Greece four times in the early 20th century. He played a major role in the reforms and political events of his era, including the Balkan Wars and the First World War.
Actress and politician, Melina Mercouri was a passionate cultural ambassador for Greece. She won the Prix d’interprétation féminine at the Cannes Film Festival in 1960 for her role in “Jamais le dimanche” and served as Greece’s Minister of Culture, fighting for the restitution of the Parthenon marbles.
These Athens personalities have left a lasting imprint in fields ranging from philosophy to politics to cinema, helping to shape the history and culture of Greece and the world.

In early 2019 I took a leap of faith and moved to Los Angeles to pursue my own, American dream. There, while working two jobs to make ends meet, I made a painful realisation: the industry that I had been born into, the industry of hospitality, is not the one that makes my heart skip a beat.
While still in the city of angels, I stumbled upon jetdrops’ job opening and I sent my CV. A couple of Skype interviews and a transatlantic flight later, here I am, sitting on my desk with my fancy new title: Communications Specialist & PR Executive.
Some people might say I kicked “an opportunity of a lifetime” by coming back to Athens, Greece. I returned extremely driven and determined to get out of my comfort zone and pursue my desire: a career in the communication field. It is a personal challenge, an investment on my own self and I am ready to face all the consequences with unapologetic confidence.
I still remember how nervous I was while preparing for my first day. I wanted to look professional and considered as an equal team member from my colleagues. My black work pants, a casual white shirt and my blue loafers were my best allies. Soon after arriving in the office, I realised my outfit plays a minimal role and everyone here speaks through their work.
After a typical “first day in the office”, where I met the rest of the team and got a brief introduction to my duties, I recall my bizarre feelings while walking home: it probably was a mixture of utter excitement and… panic; a mixture that even today, cannot fully decode & understand.
This was not your typical 9–5 job, full of judgemental supervisors or surrounded by people who hate their jobs. jetdrops is an environment of regulated individual autonomy that operates with a common purpose: build projects that make the team proud and the client happy. And if not anything else, I had come to respect their commitment and work of ethic. Thus I could not help but feel intimidated since I had yet, nothing to offer to the table.
Despite the fact that I have very little experience working in an advertising & communications agency, terms like “press release”, “media kit” and “brand awareness” were not foreign to me. However, understanding their practical meaning has in fact proven to be extremely crucial.
My manager and mentor, Dora Papakonstantopoulou, has been a catalyst that will determine my future in this field. My learning process has been expedited; reporting, research, project management and aligning with internal and external stakeholders have been in my place since day one. Before my second week came to an end, I had already organised and facilitated the internal process of an upcoming campaign’s brainstorming.
Having such an overall sense of responsibility is the kind of position I have been dreaming for and, despite my limited experience, I am determined to validate my efforts. My choice of leaving la-la land was a risk that was meant to be taken and I fully agree with Jim Rohn:
If you are not willing to risk the usual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.

Clear your calendar on May 22, 2023, and prepare yourself for the trial of the millennium. And it’s not the one you’re thinking of. This particular event has been in the making for about two thousand years.
The one and only Socrates has received a second day in court, in front of The National Hellenic Museum (NHM) in Chicago of all places
Honestly, I’d convict him again, but my opinion isn’t popular.
The gut reaction for most is an easy win for the defense. After all, Socrates is likely one of the most beloved figures in the history of philosophy. As law student and history scholar Theodoros Karasavvas at Ancient Origins points out:
“His death was a dark moment in Athenian and human history, but his thinking and teachings have survived as a beacon of light for almost 2,500 years.”
Karasavvas also reminds us “for all his greatness and popular acclaim, Socrates had fanatic enemies as well,” mainly for his “powers of persuasion” and “opposition to authority.”
Like many have stated before, he calls the original case “one of the saddest cases of a miscarriage of justice…

A literary translation of my thoughts on cities, public spaces, urbanism etcetera.

This one came to me as a volunteer assignment from Laneway Project, a nonprofit organisation in Toronto that works to convert laneways to vibrant public spaces. As researcher and writer, I was asked to study best practices in laneway projects across the world and write about any one of them. Since another volunteer had already researched examples from the US & Australia, I was left to get more creative and research about lesser known examples from the non-English-speaking world.
There were four projects that were interesting to study — the Dashilar project in Beijing that revived a traditional urban hutong in the city; the revival of Gaengeviertel in Hamburg by artists and citizens to prevent its demolition; a project called BioUrban in Sao Paulo led by a sociologist who lived and worked in a favela to develop a sense of stewardship among the favela dwellers and lastly, Atenistas — a citizen group in Athens that is run exclusively by volunteers to regenerate dead spaces in Athens and make people fall in love (again) with Athens.
Tough as it may be, I had to choose one of these projects to write on. I think what really pulled me towards Atenistas was the community spirit and love for the city they seemed to be injecting into Athens and its people. And so, I began to write about them. To read the article, click here.

A week ago, we drove 30 kilometers to Athens. We had to do a hospital check-up, which turned out to finish quickly.
It was broad daylight in Athens at that time, and we didn’t feel like driving back 30 kilometers to home immediately. So, we decided to do something in the city. We had plenty of time until dusk.
There were several Asian restaurants in Athens with cuisine that I wanted to taste. Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, and Indonesian foods were among the options I was curious about. To kill time, we therefore opted to have lunch at an Asian restaurant.
After comparing the opening hours of several restaurants, we finally picked an Indonesian restaurant. It was the only one ready to accept hungry visitors. Other restaurants would open later, in the afternoon or evening.
Without further ado, we drove off to Agios Nikolaos.
The Indonesian restaurant that we were about to visit was Lombok Red Chili—lombok means ‘chili’ in Indonesian.

After my emotional post talking about seeing the Acropolis and Parthenon from afar I thought I would now share our experience of seeing it all up close and personal.
We decided to go and visit the site on our third day in Athens and set off nice and early to make sure we had a full day to take it all in.
We walked through the city feeling excited and with the boys chatting a lot about what they were expecting to see. I understand why people use taxis and other public transport to get around cities but if you are physically able I really recommend walking. As you approach the main entrance to the hill you come through a village within the city called Plaka. It’s one of the oldest parts of the city and is full of quaint winding roads filled with cafés, restaurants, tourist shops and jewellery stores. You’ll pay more for food and goods here as they are hoping to entice the excited overseas visitors but if you go just for the atmosphere and hold back from getting the credit card out it’s really charming.
We made our way through the maze of small streets and approached the top of the hill. Before you get to the main entrance, over to your right you will see a rocky outpost jutting up in front of you. This is called Areopagus Hill (or Mars Hill) and if you like your Christian history this is the hill where the Apostle Paul delivered his famous “sermon in the mount”.
There are some steps up to the top and it’s really worth taking 5 minutes to head up and take in the views. You can see Plaka beneath you stretching out to the city beyond and behind you is the Parthenon, sitting grandly at the top of the hill. This is where you get your first full view of the size and magnificence of the place.
After we’d had our fill of this view we made our way over to the ticket office. We’d read that in the summer it can get really busy but on this warm December day just before Christmas it was fairly quiet and we didn’t have to queue at all. There were quite a few tour guides eager for us to use their services but we’d decided to go at our own pace and so politely, but increasingly firmly, said no thank you.
In the winter season you pay €10 for adult tickets with children getting in for free (the adult price is doubled through the summer). Your ticket gives you access to the whole site which is massive so well worth the money we thought.
We entered through the ticket barriers and tried to get our bearings a little. There’s a hill straight in front of you that takes you up to the Parthenon itself and then pathways leading away to your left and right, we took the right hand path and started to wander along.
One of the first things we saw was The Odeon of Herodes Atticus. This is a fairly “modern” part of the site because although the original theatre was built in 161 CE, over the years it was left to ruin before being rebuilt in the 1950’s and it is still used for drama and musical productions throughout the year. The seating area is solid marble and really impressive. You can also see this structure from the road behind the Parthenon site and it’s worth taking a wander at some point while in Athens to see both angles.
Carrying on past the Odeon there are collections of pillars, engraved stones and other treasures that have been excavated from the site over time. A very serious security guard is on hand to be sure no one is touching but you can go right up the stones, getting really close and trying to make out the faded drawings and writing which we thought was great.
A little further along is the Theatre of Dionysus. Much older than it’s Odeon counterpart and would have been used to showcase the first Greek tragedies in the 6th Century BCE. Dionysus was god of many things including wine making, festivity and theatre and we thought he sounded a fun god to have around.
We then wandered around the rest of the gardens on that side of the hill, you can see more artifacts dotted about and there are plenty of information signs in both Greek and English that fill in any of the gaps in knowledge that you might have. On the south side of the hill, high up from ground level is the entrance to The Forgotten Monument of Thrysallus. An ancient entrance to a temple that is now sadly too damaged to enter safely. The doorway, with it’s white columns, stark against the surrounding rock looks really enticing and I hope that they are able to restore and reopen this impressive monument one day.
Having seen all there was to see at ground level we now began to make our way up the uneven paths towards the Parthenon itself.
If you are ever here you must make sure you enter through the Propylaea, this is the original entrance where Athenians through the ages would have entered to seek knowledge or help or to pray and it’s really a grand sight. We took some time to sit on the steps, drinking in the atmosphere. It was a little busy but not overwhelming and everyone was mindful and respected other’s personal space. Other than signs asking you to please not touch the marble, it’s all open and again you can get really close to the pillars and stonework that make up the walk way to the top of the Acropolis.
Once at the top of the stairs the floor levels off, there is always work being done on the site and they have apparently spent a long time in recent years improving access. So although the pathways around the temples are rocky and uneven there is a smooth path right through the middle making it much more accessible to those with mobility issues.
There is so much to see once at the top, the highlight of course being the Parthenon itself, the largest structure and centrepiece of the site (this is the one you see on posters, postcards and websites — the one you can see from all around the city). Plenty of scaffolding around the temple does not detract from it’s size and grandeur. Take some time to study the pillars, looking at the hand carved detail is astonishing. We did at least two laps of the building before moving on.
My favourite thing to see was the temple of Athena — with it’s reproduction statues of the goddess around the front (you can see the originals in the Acropolis museum), it’s really a site worth seeing. If you can manage some steps and uneven ground go around the back to see the enormous entrance door to get a perspective of what it would have been like for members of the public coming to pray and offer gifts to the goddess.
The last thing I’ll point out as a “must do” up here is to go to the far end of the site and up a few steps to the Acropolis View point. This looks back over the Parthenon and other temples giving you a wonderful vantage point (and if you are feeling brave you can also peer over the top at the sheer drop down the side of the Acropolis back to street level! Warning this is not an activity for those, like my dear husband, who are worried about heights).
There are of course many other sites to see, smaller temples like Athena Nike (which was painstakingly taken apart, renovated and then put back together again in the late 1990's), as well as other areas of restoration. If you go with children see if they can spot the metal tracks that circle the site which are used to move the huge stones and marble structures as work is carried out.
After we had had our fill of Greek history we slowly made our way back down through the grand entrance and back down the hill. It takes some time, partly because it’s all quite uneven and a little slippery but partly because you just can’t stop looking at the architecture and small treasures to be found around each new corner.
We left the site through the smaller entrance on the South side, along the pedestrianised walkway of Dionysiou Areopagitou. I understand that this entrance is mostly used for tour groups and school visits but in the summer can be less busy than the main entrance for individuals needing to buy tickets.
The entrance to the Acropolis Museum is also along this walkway, we did the museum visit on a different day but if you are only in Athens for a short time it would definitely make sense to do both in the same day as they are so close. I would really recommend seeing the Acropolis first as it was fabulous to see the friezes, statues and pillars in the museum and be able to picture where you would have seen them up on the hill.
Like so many people seeing the Parthenon and spending time on the Acropolis was one of the big reasons for our visit to this city and it did not disappoint. Here are some final tips that I think would make your visit go smoothly:
* Wear good comfy, study shoes. They are making big improvements to accessibility on the site but there are lots of uneven pathways, steps and slippery surfaces so open toed sandals would not be a great choice of footwear.
* Bring plenty of water. It was a warm day when we went and with the amount of walking we did we needed plenty of hydration, I imagine it can get quite uncomfortable in the summer months.
* Read up about some the Greek gods before you go, in particular Athena, Psoiedon, Zeus and Dionysus. It was really great to bring those names to life as we saw the temples and read the information signs.
* If you are going to visit more than one or two archaeological sites you can buy combination tickets which can end up saving you money.
*Decide beforehand if you would like to use a guide while you are there so you can be confident in saying yes or no to the people who approach you at the ticket entrances.
Comment below if you’ve found this useful or if you’ve been yourself and would add any other tips :-)

It’s currently day 5, and I should say first off that it’s pretty hard to get started on writing right now. That’s not because I’m exhausted from all the cycling and heat and general intensity (although I very much am). Rather, it’s the opposite. It’s because I’m laid back in the perfect deckchair, reclined at the perfect angle, looking out at the perfect view from my perfect rest-day holiday home which I snagged for the perfect — and perfectly ridiculous — price of £33 a night.
But it hasn’t all been this sweet. Far from it.
Let’s rewind a bit.
Athens was good to me, all things considered. This is a blog about bike touring so I won’t go into too much detail regarding my holiday affairs, but a few choice notes before we continue:
Verdict: I thoroughly recommend Athens as a city to visit. Don’t hesitate if you get the chance.
Anyway, let’s get this bike tour started!
I’d been waiting for the bike tour anxiety to arrive for months, and it was only on the morning of leaving that it hit me. But I don’t think it was the tour as a whole I was afraid of; it was simply getting out of Athens. I’ve been to cities with worse traffic, but I’ve also been to cities with much better.
I tried to make the most of the €4 all-you-can-eat breakfast, shovelling spoonfuls of oats into my mouth, but the nerves weren’t allowing my stomach to settle. I did my best to force it all down, figuring that I’d just throw some of it up if need be. My body would work it out.
I’d reassembled my bike the previous day and had all my bags packed, so I’m not quite sure how it took me a further hour to get going, but that’s what happened. Eventually I was ready, and, after some rejigging of the panniers (does one ever just jig?), I was on my wobbly wobbly way out of the hostel and into the streets of Athens. I had begun!
And then, not 10 seconds later, I stopped. Brake calibration issues would in fact plague me for the next hour or so, but eventually I got those suckers under control and started to build some momentum. As for the streets of Athens, they were remarkably easy to navigate (Komoot certainly helped). There were plenty of bike lanes, pink and quiet and well-paved, and within just a few minutes of finding them all my fears of getting squashed by a passing fruit cart were put to rest.
The bike lanes eventually ended and I had no choice but to take to the roads, but these weren’t too much trouble. There was one hill which to this day remains the steepest hill I’ve climbed — we’re talking cheese-rolling levels here — but after I’d tidied my lungs back into my chest, the rest of Athens was plain sailing.
Talking of sailing, next up was the Port of Piraeus, where I’d been told I could board a ferry to Salamina, a necessary stepping stone on the way out of Greece. I asked around and was told a boat would come ‘soon’. Four people gave me the same answer. I waited for the boat. And waited. And waited. Was ‘soon’ actually the Greek word for ‘you’re in the wrong place, my friend’?
It might well have been. Eventually, the fifth person I asked told me that I was indeed at the wrong port and that I’d need to get to Perama. Alrighty then. Another 10km of riding, this stretch significantly less enjoyable as I shared main roads with speeding cars, and I was finally at the right port just as the ferry was about to leave. I rolled the bike onto the ferry and gave myself a pat on the back for making it through the streets of Athens.
Riding in Salamina was great, my first experience of the treats to come. An appetiser, if you will. Lightly undulating hills carried me past glittering waters under a clear blue sky, and there was a pretty horse somewhere too. It wasn’t long before I had to stop for my first photoshoot — the first of many, I’m not ashamed to say.
After an hour or so, I reached the next ferry that would take me back to the mainland. Rolling my bike onto the ferry, a man in overalls began yelling at me:
‘Look at the cones, look at the cones, what do they mean!?’
Smiling dumbly, I told him I didn’t know what the cones meant, but, goodness me, there’s a strong smell of paint in here, isn’t there?
It turned out I had rolled my bike straight over his freshly painted deck. Whoopsie. The paint wasn’t wet enough to cling to my tyres — a shame, cornflower blue wheels would have been quite fetching — but he gave me an earful nonetheless. I made my silly-tourist apologies and parked up my bike, breathing in the good if slightly painty sea air as we made the crossing.
Back on the mainland, I experienced some hillier sections for the next hour or so. My legs hadn’t yet adjusted to the work required and I found this pretty tough going. However, it was made much easier by the scenery I was passing through: looming dusty-orange cliff faces to the right, sparkling ocean to the left. And also by the driver who gave me the rocker sign as he passed me in his van. Thank you, stranger.
Away from the coast, I had my first encounter with aggressive dogs. This was to become a frequent occurrence. You hear the barks first of all, not quite sure which direction they’re coming from, and then suddenly there’s a four-legged creature all slobber and fury rushing towards you. I’ve become a little more used to it by now, but it still jars, and the first time was a pretty hairy experience.
At one point, the dogs wouldn’t stop chasing me and I was worried about them getting caught in the wheels, so I stopped, put the bike between myself and the dogs, and in my best angry-dad voice, commanded ‘STOP, BAD DOG, GO HOME’. And did they listen? Reader, they did not. They just snarled and barked and bared their impressive canines.
But, next time, I’d be ready for them. Oh, I’d be ready for them. I’d slipped my ultrasonic dog repeller into my pocket for easy access and, at the first sound of barking, I wielded my wand like Ron Weasley at a pack of fluffy dementors.
Be gone, vile beasts! I might or might not have yelled.
And, astonishingly, it worked! At least kind of. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting anything at all from this unassuming bit of plastic, and it’s true that the device didn’t stop them from chasing me all together. But once I clicked that magic button, they seemed to fall back to a safer distance. And oh, the power I felt… This Ron might just become his own Voldemort.
As the day was drawing to a close and my energy reserves were being depleted, I stopped off for the perfect refuel: a pita filled with chips and gyros. This I shared with a much nicer chap than the ones who had come before. Maybe it was the food, but this dog was just an absolute pal. Perhaps I should be wielding chicken gyros at my attackers rather than a plastic stick in future.
I finally reached my campsite in Ancient Corinth at around 7.30pm. I didn’t want to wild camp, deciding that it would be best for the first night to be somewhere I felt safe and could get a decent night’s rest.
The former worked out well; the latter, not so much. Dogs barked from all sides deep into the night and, as I had left my earplugs in my panniers and was tucked up (un)comfortably in my tent, I couldn’t bring myself to go outside and get them. Eventually, at around 1.30am and with the chorus of howls still in full swing, I succumbed and dragged myself out of the tent.
It was a smart move. There is a singular pleasure to wandering out of your tent in the dead of night — the stars, the moon, the exquisite isolation. As I stood there craning my neck up at the sky, feeling impossibly small and yet entirely undiminished, I felt a deep sense of good will from the universe. The trip had begun, and everything was going to be okay.
Distance covered: 94km / Elevation gained: 740m

Welcome to Athens, Mississippi. Athens is an unincorporated community just a few minutes outside of the small town that I reside in. But, somehow, I had never explored it.
I assembled a dream team of myself, Davis Helton, and Luke Johnson (Davis would kill me if he didn’t have a shout-out), and we decided to delve deep into this lost community to visit the long-fabled Athens Jail.
Built in 1830, the jail is somewhat mysterious, with stories of ghosts running abound in my community. According to the fine folks at the Monroe County Historical Society (this society is truly top notch, keeping records and finding stories of a small community with little publicity), Joshua Toomer created the current structure of the jail in 1845. Later that night, Toomer drunkenly hopped on the wrong horse and was accused of being a horse thief. This accusation landed him the luxury of being the first person to stay a night in this newly founded jail.
It is no surprise that ghostly rumors would be abundant for a building of this nature. This is where things get a little murky, as the jail kept no records as to who exactly died there and how.

During my Emerging Media Master’s program, I developed a capstone project in place of a thesis. I partnered with my peer, Zoë Phalen, to create Athens Era.
The final task on the capstone journey requires individuals and teams to present their project at the event, Emerge. This event invites students, faculty, alumni, and guests to celebrate the completion of the degree and each capstone project. Each team takes the spotlight and provides an overview of their completed work.
I created an e-ccomerce marketplace website for local artists of Athens, GA along with my partner for our capstone project, called Athens Era. I worked on developing the website, while producing supporting materials. All materials and deliverables may be accessed on our project website, here.
We developed our capstone project in separate stages, and documented our progress with youtube videos. Our full capstone journey can be viewed on our youtube playlist, here.
At the beginning of this course, we already produced our capstone website in its alpha stage. We started with developing our website in its beta stage, with guidance from the results of our user research and testing.
We had identified the website’s issues, but finding the solution for each was our challenge.
With each stage of development, we focused on separate issues we identified during our research:
One of our biggest leaps in development, was when we created additional graphics to match our brand and help tell the story of what Athens Era is. They really helped show how Athens Era is a credible platform for artists and assisting in storytelling throughout the website. Here are a few graphics:
Beyond the development of our capstone website, we created a poster to promote our final project. With this poster, we aimed to clearly communicate what Athens Era is and attract people to the website. This would help solve the issue of: “weak recognition of website for only Athens, GA artists” before people first visit the website.
Of course, we also addressed the weak recognition of the website for only Athens artists by changing our information architecture and wording for more clarity.
Along with the poster, we also created a trailer for the promotion of Athens Era. We began with a storyboard of our original idea for the production of the trailer.
Later, we iterated our storyboard to reflect our final trailer, which may be viewed here.
We used Canva to produce our trailer after trying out different videos platforms. Due to our lack of video production equipment, we opted to use Canva for its digital animations and resources for a fully digitally designed trailer, as opposed to using raw footage we could have filmed form our phones.
After we uploaded all of our deliverables to our project website and concluded our development on Athens Era, we presented our results at the New Media Institute’s end of year event, Emerge.
Our Emerge presentation summarizes our capstone journey and demos our functioning website and its notable features.
We spoke about the inspiration of the project, along with our ideation methods, research, and development.
The Athens Era Emerge Presentation may be viewed here.
Throughout this course, I learned how to effectively communicate with an audience through digital and physical products. I am pleased with the completion of our capstone project and how much I have developed my storytelling skills.

Greece is one of the oldest, most authentic, and most delicious countries you can ever visit.
Besides its magnificent culture and history, Greek cuisine is something you need to try!
A lot of the Greek delights are similar to the food we are used to having here in Egypt, but with an exquisite twist!
Meat is vital in Greek cuisine. You have three dishes that you may think are the same: Souvlaki, Gyro, and Kebap.
Souvlaki means skewer, so it’s basically anything grilled on a skewer; could be meat, chicken, or lamb, usually served on a dish, but sometimes also gyro-style. Yummy!
Eating at Thanasis, a very famous local souvlaki place.(Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is the most traditional 2-euro food in Greece.
Meat is grilled vertically and then sliced (like shawarma), rolled in the delicious Greek “pita” bread, and sauced with the most famous Greek sauce: tzatziki (you may think you have tried it in Egypt, but trust me, it is not the same).
Fun fact: almost every gyro place in Athens has Egyptian workers!

This is the last of the meat trio. It looks like “kofta,” but much more delicious, with a different set of spices. It is also larger in size and more fatty and is usually served gyro-style. This is also cheap, 2 euro food.
4- Mousaka
This is like pasta-free lasagne, made up of eggplants, zucchini, minced meat, and potatoes, topped with onions and tomatoes and covered in bechamel and sometimes grilled cheese. It is a traditional delicious dish you must try.
Eating Spinakotapa for breakfast. I can do that every day. (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
This is a personal favorite. I hardly love spinach, but this spinach pie has changed what I think about vegetables!
It is a pastry pie filled with green sautéed spinach, sometimes with grilled cheese or feta cheese, available in different shapes and sizes. Personally, I can have this for breakfast every single day!
No Greek food list should miss tzatziki! This sauce is the most common appetizer and the most delicious dipping for almost anything. Whether you are eating chips, eggplant, or meat, tzatziki works as a perfect dip. Or you can just eat it with a pita!
Deep-fried feta cheese! Here in Egypt, we are used to having “Roumi” cheese fried, but feta? You should try this!
Simply zucchini balls. I’m not a big fan of zucchini at all, but Greece taught me that I am wrong! Almost any food that contains zucchini here is utterly delicious. I even had zucchini pizza!
Try this one and change how you feel about zucchini forever.
Zucchini balls and Saganaki, are delicious Greek specialties. (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
Some of you might be familiar with this. It is an old recipe that my grandpa used to make for us but is rarely found anywhere now. It is a very simple recipe of oil, sugar, semolina flour, and water.
It is like a greenish pudding with a truly mesmerizing sweet taste. You should give it a try.
Although it looks exactly like your regular “konafa,” I promise you, it’s not the same!
Kanataifi is more creamy, frothy, and sweet. It literally melts in your mouth. You should have one!
Chilling in my favorite Athens neighborhood, the Plaka (Photo: Nour Eldin Ebrahim)
These are just some of the Greek delights! The list is longer than we can fit in one article. There is Loukoumades, Galaktoboureko, Fava, Baklava, Taramosalata, and your good old Greek salad too!
You will gain a couple of kilograms in Athens, that’s for sure.

A blog looking at modern performance, adaptation and appropriation of Shakespeare on stage, screen and beyond. #RethinkingShax

Last week I attended the NT Live broadcast of Nicholas Hytner’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at The Bridge Theatre and it is an experience which I will never forget. Just as Peter Brook’s seminal RSC production struck a chord in the 1970s with its minimalist staging and darker, adult take on Shakespeare’s comedy, so I expect director Hytner’s immersive, pop culture savvy production to become one which defines future Dreams for decades to come.
Despite the largely carnivalesque tenor of this production (which felt as palpable in the cinema as in the theatre), the production opened on an unexpectedly sombre note. A procession of black clad men and women entered the stage singing in plain chant, thus conjuring a funereal mood as opposed the ‘nuptial hour’ promised in Theseus’s (Oliver Chris) opening line.
The costumes of the female characters, the audience had been told in the opening commentary before the production began, were supposedly evocative of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, which has found renewed cultural currency in recent years due to a successful television adaptation and its resonance with contemporary feminist movements such as #MeToo.
This was underlined by the production’s first (of many) spectacular effects as Hippolyta (Gwendoline Christie) was transported onstage, trapped inside a sleek glass cage which reminded the audience of her status as a captive queen, a fact over which so many productions choose to elide. Gemma wrote about this aspect of the production in detail in her article earlier this week, offering a deeper dive into that image and its connections to Christie’s role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones.
Not only is Hippolyta a prisoner to a conquering duke but Hermia (Isis Hainsworth) is also greatly mistreated in this opening scene as it is assumed that she is the property of both her father and intended husband, despite her protestations that she wishes to marry another man of her choosing. The decision to draw out these more insidious themes from one of Shakespeare’s most beloved comedies by connecting them to memorable feminist imagery in popular culture was therefore highly astute.
One of the key feature’s of this production were the modern linguistic additions to Shakespeare’s text which, although initially jarring in the serious opening scenes at court, felt incredibly natural once delivered by the Rude Mechanicals in their first appearance onstage. The Bridge Theatre’s immersive pit also allowed actors to use the audience in inventive and involving ways, such as when the Mechanicals wish to consult a ‘calendar’ in Act 3 Scene 1 to know whether the moon will shine during their performance.
Given the ‘extra-textual’ additions to Shakespeare’s text already established early on in the production, it therefore made perfect sense for the cast to break out into the audience and decide to consult the Calendar app in an audience member’s phone. This not only updated the scene to incorporate the changing sense of what the word ‘calendar’ means but gave way to hilarious unspoken remonstrations when the Mechanicals became side-tracked by looking through said phone at images which we can only assume were illicit. The extract from the broadcast below features this moment in all its glory.
Hammed Animashaun’s extraordinary Bottom shone particularly brightly during these anachronistic moments. His naturalistic delivery and a wide comedic range encompassed everything from deadpan moments able to draw laughs by the merest eyebrow raise to the best version of Pyramus’s ludicrously overlong and overblown suicide which I’ve ever witnessed.
However, it would be remiss not to mention Felicity Montagu’s understated Quince, who provided the perfect foil for her shrieking, scene-stealing counterpart. There was a perfectly acute balance between tension and affection at the heart of their relationship. Despite Bottom’s leading thespian/backseat director pushing against the rules imposed by Quince’s put-upon actor-manager, it was nevertheless clear that they were pulling in the same direction and this ensured that those scenes were some of the production’s best.
In a further attempt to redress the gender imbalance and biases of Shakespeare’s play, Hytner chose to swap many of the lines delivered by Oberon (Oliver) and Titania (Christie). It is this decision, perhaps, that served the production most effectively. Now with the lion’s share of the lines, Christie was a truly powerful Titania, displaying brilliant armography (thanks Strictly) and radiating majestical power which will be familiar to anyone who has seen her steal each Game of Thrones scene in which she features.
The reversal of Fairy King and Queen was particularly effective in the inclusion of a subtle twist at the play’s end that — thanks to Oliver and Christie playing both the magical and mortal monarchs — Hippolyta may have secretly conjured the fairy kingdom to terrorise her husband-to-be. Hytner chose to keep this ambiguous but it was an inspired suggestion and made sense of the decision to have the same two actors play these roles.
Christie was ably supported by a nimble, creepy, day-glo Puck, played by David Moorst who delivered a brilliantly original iteration of the beloved fairy: think Lee Evans meets Willem Dafoe. Moorst not only displayed a spectacular array of acrobatics but oscillated between mischievous contempt for the lovers he poisoned and genuine pathos once he realised the extent to which they had suffered. Like Animashaun, his delivery of the extra-textual additions felt incredibly natural, whilst the blurring of the fairy and courtly world were sinisterly underscored by his additional role as a quietly malevolent Philostrate.
An example of the production’s attention to detail and its capacity to elevate oft-forgotten moments in this oft-performed play was Philostrate’s address to the three couples prior to the Rude Mechanicals’ performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Prior to Theseus selecting their play, an array of other options are delivered by Philostrate and, rather than skate over these in the audience’s anticipation of Dream’s grand comedic climax, Hytner instead chose to have actors (who had already featured as fairies) appear onstage to represent those alternatives.
These ranged from a group of women grotesquely entangled in red balloons to a vaudevillian entertainer creating a paper chain of people, all of which was in service of an inspired final gag. Theseus’s decision was framed as a reality television-esque winner reveal, underscored by ever-diminishing lights and the dramatic music which erupted once the Mechanicals had been selected. Their adorable purple jumpers (which read ‘Rude Mechanicals’ on the back) underscored their position as amateurs amidst professionals. Truly, Athens Got Talent.
In my next article, I’ll focus in greater detail on these references to modern culture and, in particular, the popular music which featured throughout this dream of a show.

After checking out the Aegean Business Class Lounge it was time to board my Aegean business class flight from Athens to Tel Aviv.
If you are just joining, catch up on my itinerary and how I booked the trip. Also see previous reviews of the ground experience in Newark for Emirates passengers, SAS Lounge at Newark, the Emirates business class flight from Newark to Athens, and my stay at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens.
I booked this flight by transferring my Amex Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan, a program that typically has good redemption values.
In this case, the cost was 15,000 miles for business class, plus $86.50 in Canadian dollars in taxes and fees. I charged the taxes and fees to my Amex Platinum to take advantage of the 5x per dollar on airfare, no foreign transaction fees, and the generous travel protection benefits it offers.
For this flight, there was a coach seat available for 7,500 miles. And as a Star Alliance Gold member, I would have received priority check-in, baggage handling, and lounge access anyway. However, I decided the premium of 7,500 miles was worth it to try the experience, even if it only consisted of a blocked middle seat and perhaps better food for the 2-hour hop. This was my first flight on Aegean so I wanted the full experience.
I left the lounge around 4:25 pm to browse duty-free and head to the gate for my 5:20 pm flight to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV).
At the gate, I was surprised that there was not much by way of added security. Usually, flights to Israel feature additional security.
Boarding began relatively on time. Aegean elites, Business Class, and Star Alliance Gold passengers were invited to board immediately after the pre-board for young families and the disabled.
Priority boarding did seem to be enforced by the Aegean gate crew which is always appreciated.
Boarding moved pretty quickly and we pushed back relatively on time. There was a safety demonstration in Greek and English and we briefly taxied before taking off.
I was welcomed at the cabin door and directed to my seat in the small forward cabin. Aegean has an exclusively narrow-body fleet and even a few propeller planes. This flight was operated by one of Aegean’s Airbus A320 aircraft.
As is standard for European short-haul business, the Aegean business class cabin was standard coach seats with a blocked middle. While people love to make fun of the recliners in domestic forward cabins in the United States, they are an upgrade over the European standard.
I assigned myself 2C. As boarding slowed, the Aegean crew quickly welcomed us aboard and offered orange juice, sparkling wine, and water (served in real glassware).
The seats offered USB-A ports, which while not a full outlet, is great to have, but somewhat outdated with the move towards USB-C.
It’s also not guaranteed on short-haul flights in Europe, even on mainline carriers. While the extra space of an empty middle was nice, I hate how some airlines put a tray in. It would be nice to be able to lift the armrest and be able to spread out (as you can on British Airways Club Europe).
There was a card in the seat pocket advertising wifi and what’s available on the portal.
It was cool to see Aegean offer 10 minutes of free connectivity onboard. While a few carriers make wifi free in premium cabins and others are aiming to make wifi free for everyone, it’s nice that Aegean gives everyone a few minutes free.
Unfortunately, the wifi was not working on this flight, so I couldn’t test the connectivity. Most of the flight was over the Mediterranean, so I can’t say I’m too surprised that wifi was not working.
Aegean distributed paper menus that were printed in English and Greek. Despite the destination being Israel, they did not have menus in Hebrew.
I was impressed by the 3-page paper menu for such a quick flight. And while US carriers have European carriers beat in terms of the seat, European carriers usually beat on service and soft product in Euro-business.
I liked that there were 2 hot entrees available to choose from. Both, however, were animal protein so if you are vegetarian or vegan, I would recommend packing your own food or ordering a special meal. The 4 wines were all Greek or from the region, a local touch I liked.
There was an extensive drinks selection of soda, coffees, teas, beers, and spirits. Having espresso drinks on board is also a nice touch of European carriers. I wish US carriers had espresso on board short-haul flights.
Based on my pre-flight research, I determined Aegean uses Stogel for their kosher meals out of Athens. My general experience with Stogel is that the food is not great, so I did not order a kosher meal ahead of time. I took a picture of the base tray set up from my seatmate, but nothing else from the service. My seatmate reported that they enjoyed the food.
I self-catered, and just ordered some beverages.
The crew very were friendly and checked back to top up beverages. As it was a quick flight, the service wrapped up pretty fast, and I passed the time till landing by reading. I did dip into the forward lavatory, which was pretty tight, but nicely appointed.
When we landed, we didn’t spend too long taxiing before deplaning at a gate. Unfortunately, Israel does not offer fast-track immigration for premium passengers and waits can be quite lengthy. However, I was lucky to have a relatively quick queue and the wait for my bag wasn’t too long once I was through.
Given the tight security entering Israel, I did not take any photos of the arrival experience in Israel.
Aegean offers a very solid business-class product, especially given that short-haul routes dominate its network. While a more premium seat would be appreciated, the friendly crew, paper menus, and meals served on real glass and china gave the overall experience a premium feel. While Athens isn’t a major connecting hub, I would not hesitate to fly Aegean in the future.

As a writer, I’m a sucker for literary themed restaurants, especially those I stumble upon, which is exactly how I found the Little Kook in Athens. The restaurant changes themes seasonally and I was lucky enough to enjoy the Alice in Wonderland ambiance.
Surrounded by the chaos of Athens’ life, adults and children alike visibly exhaled when they entered the alleyway with tables lined under an archway of decorations. The vibrant colors, familiar characters, and smell of desserts in the air seemed to bring out the silliness in the patrons: laughter, photos, one older woman giving herself cat ears as she posed next to Alice.
The staff was dressed in full themed outfits. I first requested a menu from Alice, then the Mad Hatter, and only after asking the Mad Hatter a third time did I receive one. It crossed my mind that perhaps I misunderstood (I am navigating Greece as a non-Greek speaker) and this was one of those “purposely rude” establishments. Don’t worry, it’s not one of those restaurants.
Before I could order, a coffee drink was brought to my table. Sadly, it belonged to the man at the next table. I’m not sure if he ever received his. The server generously told me to keep what they brought and did not charge me for the drink.
After reviewing the English menu, I narrowed it down to ordering Granny’s Hair, The…

By Megan Sheekey
This week Mayor Giorgos Kaminis announced the creation of the Athens Partnership, a nonprofit vehicle established with guidance from Bloomberg Associates. The mission of the Athens Partnership is to facilitate public-private partnerships, supporting priority public programs in Athens, Greece. This uniquely positioned entity will intersect between city government and the private sector, leveraging the resources and strengths of both. It will allow the city, with philanthropic support, to address pressing needs and pilot new programs while evaluating their outcomes and merit for future investment.
As the migrant crisis and economic instability in Greece continue to deeply affect Athens residents, the Partnership will be one tool to help the city remain responsive and moving forward. Bloomberg Associates is honored to count Athens among its client cities.
Op-ed by Athens Mayor George Kaminis in the newspaper “Kathimerini Tis Kiriakis”
ATHENS PARTNERSHIP
A Mayor who wishes to do his job properly in today’s Greece must always find a balance among four basic priorities. Firstly, he must ensure the daily operation of his city. Secondly, he must respond to the social needs constantly generated by the current economic crisis (soup kitchens, homeless shelters, distribution of primary need goods, social tutoring classes, etc.). Thirdly, he must react fast to the, special or by now usual, political uproars we have been experiencing in recent years (political violence, long term strikes, occupation of public buildings, extended delinquency etc.). Fourthly, in several cities, as for example Athens, the mayor is now required to deal also with the multiple consequences of the refugee/immigration issue threatening to deconstruct an entire society, the strengths of which are tested and have reached their limit in the last six years.
One would say that all of this constitutes a multifaceted reality, which every mayor acting under similar conditions is compelled to deal with. In some way, this chronic and multifaceted crisis that our country is going through has formulated a “normality” of its own, an explosive mixture of daily life and special circumstances, where the latter are clearly dominating, since daily life in our days obeys to no normal routine. The drastic reduction in resources, both in manpower and materials, along with a number of other factors have made extremely and unimaginably difficult the effort of a mayor to even accomplish elementary duties such as, e.g., sanitation.
It is not enough though to just keep our head above water. We must also have our eyes focused deep in the horizon. Our cities, especially the major ones, and Athens mainly, have eventually taken over the duty to prepare the country for the post-crisis times. What the central government has failed to realize for several years now is that there are actually municipalities that are innovative. This is what we’ve been doing for so long in Athens.
At the same time that we are dealing with the problems of today being absolutely focused on our job, we are also obligated to prepare for tomorrow, raising the bar to the height it should be as if everything around us was going well. We are constantly seeking new modes of action, with a stable outward orientation, in Greece as well as abroad. In Athens especially we have broadened the range of collaboration of the City, forming partnerships with all of the reliable agencies of the city: businesses, public organizations, professional and commercial chambers, universities, private sponsors and, certainly the active citizens of the Society of Citizens.
Today we are taking a step further. We created the Partnership for Athens or Athens Partnership, a non-profit organization promoting targeted synergies of the municipality with the private sector.
With the Athens Partnership we support infrastructure projects, but also initiatives to reinforce the social cohesion and economic development and by and large the improvement of the quality of life in the city. The Partnership is seeking to attract donations from foundations, businesses and private sponsors, among which of course are the Greeks Abroad. The organization and operation of the Partnership shall obey the most updated principles of accountability, transparency and effectiveness, with emphasis on the funding of innovative and pilot programs, which shall not only benefit the city but also the municipality through the transfer of modern know how. As an independent organization operating between the municipality of Athens and the private sector, the Athens Partnership combines the forces of both, with the final beneficiary being the resident of our city.
The Athens Partnership is following the tradition of successful prototypes that have been operating efficiently for several years in major cities abroad such as London, New York, Los Angeles, and Melbourne; they also have non-profit organizations cooperating creatively with the municipalities in vitally important sectors, like fighting poverty, dealing with crises and sustainable development.
The municipal authority of our city and myself, personally would like to extent our heartfelt thanks to all the private citizens and organizations in Greece and abroad that have supported at times the capital with donations and sponsorships. With the Athens Partnership we are capitalizing on the experience we have acquired and upgrading the quality of our cooperation with all those who are intended to help us in this difficult task that we have undertaken: to keep our city standing and methodically prepare it for the future.

I came with low expectations — a stopover, a few days at most. “It’s kind of chaotic,” a friend warned me. “Not like the islands.” But I landed, blinked into the bright Athenian sun, and something in me clicked.
It started with the coffee. Greeks take their coffee seriously, and I learned quickly that sipping a freddo espresso at a slow pace is practically a lifestyle here. I sat at a small café in Koukaki and watched the city swirl around me: scooters zipping past, old men arguing over backgammon, the Acropolis peeking out in the distance like it was eavesdropping on our conversations.
Athens has this joyful contradiction to it — ancient and alive. In one direction, you walk past ruins that have witnessed centuries. In the other, a street artist is painting a neon mural on a crumbling wall. It’s not a museum — it’s a mosaic. And somehow, it works.
I wandered through Plaka, where balconies overflowed with bougainvillea and cats napped in the sun like tiny emperors. I bought fresh koulouri from a street vendor for 50 cents and felt like I’d hacked happiness.
Then came the music. At sunset, I stumbled upon a group of musicians playing traditional Greek songs near Anafiotika. Strangers danced. Kids laughed. Someone handed me a drink and said “Kalosorises” — Welcome. I smiled so wide my cheeks hurt.
I kept walking. The golden hour in Athens is no joke. It bathes the entire city in honey — softening even the graffiti and concrete into something cinematic. I climbed Filopappou Hill and looked back at the Parthenon as the lights flicked on. It felt like the city was winking at me.
And just like that, I was in love.
Not with some idealized version of Athens, but with the real one. The imperfect, passionate, noisy, sun-soaked Athens that feeds you too much and talks too loud and insists you stay just a little longer.
By the end of the afternoon, I stopped being a tourist. I was a guest. Maybe even something more.
Athens didn’t just surprise me — it lifted me. Reminded me that joy doesn’t have to be loud to be deep. That sometimes, happiness is a glass of cold white wine on a rooftop with strangers who feel like old friends, and a city that feels like home — even if it isn’t yours.

Note to Readers:
These reflections are simply my personal observations and interpretations, based on my experiences in Athens. I understand that myths, religions, and cultures are deeply subjective and complex. While the stories and comparisons might resonate differently with others, I hope to offer a glimpse into how I viewed these intersections from my own perspective. At the end of the day, we all bring our unique lenses to the world, and it is through these diverse viewpoints that we learn from each other.
The story of the city of Athens being named so starts with a scene of a duel between Athena and Poseidon. A king sought a patron deity for the city who would protect it from attacks and bless its citizens. Both gods were interested.
The venue for the duel was decided to be at the top of a hill where Acropolis stands today. Poseidon struck his trident on the ground and out came gushing water. People ran to have a sip of what they thought was holy. It turned out to be saline, reinforcing Poseidon’s dominion over the Sea. Then Athena struck her staff and there emerged a beautiful olive tree. Olive proved invaluable to the greeks: Its wood were used to make boats that helped them trade, fruits made pickles, seed pressed for oil. Therefore, Athena was chosen as the patron deity. [1]
However, this enraged Poseidon who cursed the city with floods. To calm him, Athenians built a temple for Poseidon at Cape Sounion, overlooking the sea, his kingdom.
The Greek gods, I realised, seemed to differ from Hindu gods in how they were influenced by emotions and expressed unpredictability in actions, which many might term as impulsive and unjust. This caused a lot of dissonance to me because of the striking contrast to Hindu deities or gods I’ve grown up around, who although express emotions, but never allow these to cloud their judgment or be unrighteous. (There are exceptions ofc, but statistically insignificant and associated with taboo). Over the course of the trip, in a conversation with my guides, I reached the conclusion that Greek gods reflect psychological archetypes, while the Hindu gods represented ethical ideals. It seems like a classic case of Prescriptive vs Cautionary approaches. I will explain this with an example later.
Meanwhile, let's take a short detour to understand present circumstances in Greece.
I arrived in Greece at night, and the first sights that greeted me were far from the postcard-perfect images of Santorini and Mykonos areas. My stay was in a residential area of Omania, away from the curated tourist experience, and I was taken aback by the sheer poverty, homelessness and drug abuse, that lined the streets.
Greece’s economic crisis played a large role in this. After joining the EU, the government underreported its actual debt, making the economy seem more stable than it was. When the truth surfaced, investor confidence collapsed, and the country fell to debt crisis.
Because Greece uses the euro, it couldn’t devalue its currency to make exports more competitive, closing gates to making an economic comeback. People lost jobs, rural population migrated to Athens, to the point that today almost one-third of Greece lives in Athens alone. This led to a strain on urban amenities. The symptoms were very visible to me. I saw open defecation, men and women fighting and desperate looks from beggars scanning passerbys.
It busted the myth which the British perpetuated in colonized India that white man is superior by nature because he is inherently civilized. [2] Turns out, stripped of prosperity, social stability decays everywhere. That social stability and ‘in-group members trust’ is more a function of economic security than a function of race, was an assuring observation.[3]
Although the situation is too complex to be done justice in a paragraph, it can be said that misplaced intention to generate political good-will coupled with several other factors instead of investing in avenues which would ensure multiplier effect in the economy, Greece fell deeper into the debt trap. (I believe we would help ourselves by applying this lesson to the worsening situation with Freebies in India.)
While Greece faces serious economic struggles, I was moved by the resilience and warmth of the Greek people despite their hardships. They were nice and straightforward, even weary of their circumstances. Tourism keeps their economy afloat but I could sense their quiet frustration with tourists. And although you can’t quiet bite the hands that feed you, you are free to resent the fact that you have to rely on it.
Anyways, back to our cultural discussion. The next day started with a tour of Acropolis. It is at the center of the city, both geographically and historically. The Greek civilisation was a cluster of city-states, each with their own Patron Deity. However, they all worshipped a shared pantheon of 12 Olympian gods.[4]
The Acropolis itself houses three key temples, each dedicated to different aspects of Athena. The Parthenon, the grandest, is dedicated to Athena Parthenos (the Virgin Goddess). The Erechtheion is tied to the myth of Athena’s contest with Poseidon, and the Temple of Athena Nike honors her as the goddess of victory. [5]
Built fully out of marble, the columns of The Parthenon stand huge, with the doors facing the east. This was done intentionally to have the sun’s first ray in the morning fall upon Athena’s idol, which was around 12 meters tall and was said to have been built out of Gold and Ivory. Must have been a beautiful sight to behold!
However, there is no idol there anymore. It was destroyed in the later years as Hellenism fell and the temple became a church first and a mosque later. What stands today is just a few columns, although the government is now working to reconstruct the temple, asserting its central role in the Greek tourism and economy.
In fact a culture-preservation law prohibits any building in athens to be taller than 103 meters, ensuring that the Acropolis must be visible from all corners of the city and should be the highest point.[6]
The funny thing however is that right next to the hill of Acropolis, I saw Mount Lycabettus, with a Greek Orthodox chapel at the top, exactly twice the height of Acropolis. Orthodox Christianity is the state religion of Greece and I couldn’t help but wonder if the placement of this chapel — literally twice higher than the sacred Acropolis — was a subtle statement of the new religious order.
Hellenism survives today in form of modern reconstructions of rituals from textual sources and around 2000 people follow the religion in private. [7] . Private, I emphasise, because the Hellenics have had a tough time recently opening a temple because the temple supervisor was jailed on inauguration day and the church released an official statement, urging the adherents of the true faith “not to be led astray”.[8] The funniest thing, the Right to practice religion is an inviolable right in the Greek constitution and it was essentially ensured to the adherents of hellenic religion after its official recognition in 2017.[9] Critics have cited the lack of proper official procedures and other troublesome aspects underlining the reason behind closure of the temple but I am of the firm belief that this is outside the scope of our discussion and is purely concern of the involved parties. We have no right to impose our POV over theirs, since the stakes differ.
Hellenism died a slow brutal death. I call it brutal because unlike the forces that actively engage in demeaning pagan practices today, did not even find Hellenism worthy of being opposed in the Roman ages. The Romans in-fact absorbed the greek pantheon, often reshaping characters and stories. The real blow came with the Fall of Rome to Christianity where Hellenism was actively suppressed (Theodosian Decrees which outlawed pagan practices).
Greek gods derive their stories from texts like The Odyssey and The Iliad and these stories (to say the least), though fascinating, feel scandalous to the modern mind. Like the story of Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and fire, who was physically deformed and married to Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite had an extramarital affair with Ares, the god of war. This angered Hephaestus who created a magical web to trap Ares and Aphrodite in the “act” in order to shame them in front of public. They were trapped and Hephaestus called the gods to witness the blatant unrighteousness. The gods simply laughed at all of them and let it slide. No one was punished. No consequence whatsoever.[10]
When such stories and their morality were challenged by the Greek philosophers, the priestly class did not seem equipped to handle the questions. In fact, instead of reasoning or applying intellectual capacity, some even tried to silence the dissent. Philosophers like Socrates, who offered alternate theories of Godhood, were thrown in prison on charges of “corrupting the youth” (shown in picture).[11] This is in severe contrast to the brahmanical approach where the response was to strengthen arguments and rationalize actions, codifying them even, which is probably the reason why Hinduism survives today. The natural response of the Vedic society to Buddhist rise was the systematic Refutation of Śūnyavāda (Doctrine of Emptiness) by Mīmāṃsakas led by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, which was later followed by the rise of Ādi Śaṅkarācārya who brought the Vedic teachings to their logical conclusions.
This is also be traced to the differing roles of the priestly class in a Hindu and Hellenic society. While the hellenic priests often acted as a medium between the gods and the common mass, conducting rituals, orally communcating stories and seeking blessings, the priestly class in Hindu society served multifold roles of conducting rituals, preserving texts, codifying ethics and asserting supremacy of The Vedas. Hinduism’s ability to absorb, debate, and reformulate ideas, even in the face of external challenges, is a significant strength. [12][13]
Although the Vedic Paramparā also distinguishes between Karma Kāṇḍa (ritual action) and Jñāna Kāṇḍa(knowledge), the traditional Gurukula system trained students across a wide spectrum of disciplines — ranging from astronomy and mathematics to linguistics, logic, and philosophy. This stands in striking contrast to ancient Greece, where schools of philosophy often developed independently of the priestly or ritualistic traditions, leading to a sharper divide between intellectual inquiry and religious practice.
The stories of gods were also contrasting, with common undertones of personified emotions. During an interaction with another Greek Mythology enthusiast, who quoted me this story of Aphrodite and Ares (the underlying theme being adultery and passion) , I was immediately reminded of the story of Lord Hanumān doubting his capabilities before making a leap to Lanka. It took him a trusted aide in the form of Jāmbavān to remind him of his true powers, set aside his doubts and take a leap across the seas. His story underlines the common theme of self-doubt and imposter syndrome that all of us face, whilst also providing a solution — seeking reassurance from a trusted friend or mentor.
If Greece taught me anything it is that Bharat and Bhartiyata are here to stay. Our ancestors have left us with an unshakable foundation — a profound source of strength and reassurance. Big white pill.
Yes, people might moving towards and away with time, but to quote His Holiness The Late Shankaracharya of Dwarkapeeth
“the seed will never perish. A minority shall always remain faithful to traditions…….. and that will be enough to keep it from getting lost”.
Around 2000 people in Greece still follow Hellenism. Zeus, Athena, and Dionysus are quitely worshipped in the altars of their homes. Their festivals have found a way to stay alive.
If a tradition, once our contemporary, can stay alive in shadows, how much stronger must ours be?
For over a thousand years, around 130 Agnihotri families have kept the sacred Agni alive. [14]
The Vedas are today chanted on the Ghats of Kashi, exactly like they were chanted 4000 years ago.
Indra, Varuna, and Mitra are still offered oblations.
The lineage of our Acharyas remains strong. The saints and realized beings still walk around us, in subtle and physical forms.
Our deities still respond to our prayers.
The institutions are still around to produce another Shivaji, another Vivekananda, and another Chandragupta Maurya.
People still chant the name of Shri Rama. Glory be to Him. Glory be to Maa Bharti for staying so strong even on the face of severe onslaughts. And Glory be to the Divine Mother for making me a Bhartiya first and an Indian second.
Seeing how remnants of Hellenism persist, despite centuries of suppression, made me appreciate how deeply rooted traditions find ways to survive. It reminded me of my own traditions and their resilience. Across cultures: faith, memory, and heritage endure in the hearts of people, waiting for the right moment to shine again.

If you follow Coworkies regularly, we’ve taken you to many different cities already. From New York to Shanghai or lately Prague, we’ve shared stories of people creating an impact on their cities by building incredible local coworking scenes. This month, we bring you to a whole new city, one we did talk about yet: Athens.
Why did we go to Athens? So many reasons!
Aside from discover a beautiful city full of History, we were curious to:
In just 2 days, we were lucky enough to find all the answers to our questions. To discover it too, scroll down and enjoy the ride through Athens unique coworking scene.
With 665,000 inhabitants in the city proper (3.75 Mo for the larger Athens) and more than 5 Mo tourists a year, Athens is without a doubt one of the lungs of Greece. Over the last decade, this lung has been heavily damaged by one of the toughest economical crisis of its History that has impacted many professionals and industries, from corporate companies to freelancers.
How did coworking grew in the middle of such a difficult time, let’s have look!
/ Facts and figures.
Unless other European capital cities such as Berlin or London, coworking has reached Athens later, more precisely in 2010 with the opening of CoLab workspace, which does not exist anymore. Until 2012, the entire country was counting 4 coworking spaces, which is a really low number that can also be explained and aligned with the crisis the country encountered as well as a lack of education about the term coworking itself.
Indeed, for a country of 11.3 Mo inhabitants, counting 4 coworking spaces does not help in spreading the word and educating the population to the new ways of working. But a wind of change has hit the country and today, in Athens only, there are about 10 coworking spaces that have flourished, offering various concepts to freelancers, companies and startups:
Now that the introduction is made, let’s dig deeper into Athens coworking scene, from the days it started to today!
Coworkies in Athens.
All and all, we spent 1 and half day in Athens and one thing is sure, we did not rest. We had the pleasure to visit 6 coworking spaces, in different areas of Athens. The diversity of spaces we came across was pretty impressive. Above all, what has impressed us even more is the people making Athens coworking scene what is is. Each one of them has a unique story that reflects in her/his space. In Athens, we’ve come across education in coworking spaces. We’ve also visited makerspace for Artists or Companies. Lastly, we’ve even had a yummy lunch prepared by refugees in a coworking space with a social impact.
We invite you to explore Athens with us by browsing around our interactive map of spaces we’ve seen! Some hidden tips and stories not present in this article are hidden in there, will you be able to find them?
The following piece has been co-written with coworking spaces from Athens. Thank you The Cube, Stone Soup and Athens Makerspace for contributing.
Did you know that, CoLab, which opened in 2010 and has now been transformed and renamed The Cube, was actually an idea pitched at the Startup Weekend?
“Like many we had also been directly affected by the crisis in Greece and we were bold and crazy enough to create our next job investing everything we had and didn’t have into a crazy new adventure. It’s been a real roller coaster but so worth it and rewarding.” — Maria, co-founder of The Cube.
Since CoLab, other coworking spaces have flourished in Athens.
In 2011, Loft2Work opened its doors, with the vision to build a space Encouraging & supporting Social Entrepreneurship as a means to promote social justice and alleviate poverty. Loft2Work was also very popular for organizing events centered on people rather than on businesses.
In 2012, 123p opened its doors with the objective to become THE place in town for startups. Renamed today the Found.ation, it is the leading technology and innovation enabling platform in SE Europe, acting as a startup hub, a digital transformation accelerator for corporations and a tech education hive.
Coworking has no borders and this is very true for Impact Hub Athens. After studying in Vienna and Madrid and working out of Impact Hub in both respective cities, , Dimitris Kokkinakis and Sophie Lamprou, returned to Athens and decided to create the brand there in 2013. Since then, Impact Hub Athens has had tremendous impact on the city, gathering professionals working for social good and organizing some of the most incredible project such as El Sistema Greece which promotes inclusion and integration for refugee children through music education and even had a huge concert at the Acropolis last summer.
In 2014, Olga and Klaas have opened Stone Soup. When we asked Olga what pushed them to open a coworking space, she told us, she got inspired by Amsterdam.
“The Dutch capital inspired me professionally, made me confident and showed me how to put in action my ideas. It also convinced me that the north was not my place to be. I came back to Greece with the dream to implement better the work I was doing in Amsterdam. I thought I would do it better because in Greece it mattered more and the impact would be bigger for my entourage and myself. So I started networking and bringing people together and we started sharing the same roof, working together and making plans for new projects, or in other words, I initiated Stone Soup by placing a pot with water on fire and threw in it some stones. Then it all started cooking…” — Olga, Stone Soup
The people of Stone Soup are…
“Professionals with one foot set in Greece and the other somewhere abroad. You cannot afford to be based only in Greece nor to depend your sales only in the local market. I think the people that surround us are motivated and adventurous with great stories to share and they can surely inspire you. They like the warm and casual vibe at Stone Soup. The ability to easily interact with other co-workers and the feeling of ownership at the space. We started as a cooperative space, and while we maintain our coop ideals, we have matured as a business and we offer our services in a more structured way. But we remain open. Whomever would like to join, they are welcome. We do not ask for a membership fee in order to share our network or knowledge and we try to operate with no strings attached. “
What if an old cosmetic factory could transform into a beautiful and modular coworking space? This is exactly what happened in 2016, when Th. Tsiropoulos and V. Stavropoulos opened the beautiful Tzaferi16. The modern and contemporary look of the space makes it a great place not only for work but also for events.
But Athens is not just about coworking spaces. The makers scene is also growing and flourishing, We visited Athens Makerspace, a young non profit organisation, founded in March 2016. When Ilias and his team started it, their vision was clear:
“Every person, of every age, must have access to the tools and knowledge they need to implement their ideas. We associate ourselves with the ideas of sustainable design, innovation and fabrication.”
What do people work on at Athens Makerspace? Well, pretty much anything it seems:
“Our members work on a variety of projects. We have amateurs, intermediate makers and professionals. So many amazing creations are taking place in our makerspace. Members who use the laser cutter to create jewelry, handbags, signs and more to sell. Members using the woodshop and electronics lab to create a full size arcade. Members who use the 3D printers and the electronics lab to create custom automations and robots. A member who uses the sewing machine to create reusable tea bags and much more. We are even developing production methods to upcycle plastic waste. Our members can use our equipment for practical, professional or artistic reasons. They are encouraged to innovate, prototype solutions meet other makers, learn and share their knowledge. There are so many possibilities. The sky is the limit!”
The opening of Athen Makerspace has inspired others. LUDD a lab for Open Design and Fabrication opened its doors in 2017. More than just a space, LUDD is a platform where the latest developments in open design, prototyping and fabrication technology, along with shared know-how, serve as the basis for a community of individuals, organizations and broader initiatives, to connect and collaborate, thus accelerating local innovation. We had the pleasure to visit Manolis, one of the co-founder and his team and were really impressed by the amount of cool projects that are built in the space. From furniture to more complex pieces, creativity has no boundaries at LUDD.
Today, Athens coworking and maker scenes have reached a new milestone. With more than 10 coworking spaces around the city and more coming, the population becomes more and more familiar with the concept of coworking and its benefits.
Chatting with our contributors, they gave us very different perspective on it:
“But I think lately it has evolved to a more self-sustained business and the market is growing. I think people are more cautious about making claims as to how much the startup hype is able to support the co-working business and the overall economy.” — Olga, Stone Soup
“The fact that we started the 1st coworking space in Athens in times of crisis actually helped people think outside the box and become go getters, innovate and create their next job not wait for it. Greeks are Entrepreneurs and we all know that crisis also brings change and opportunity with it. There is a lot of brain drain but at the same time one of our services is recruiting local talent to international companies that are trying to and looking into the market in establishing here in Athens, this way giving the talent a reason to stay.” Maria, co-founder of The Cube.
Chatting about the makers scene, it is also growing and changing:
“There are a few interesting spaces in Athens that promote the maker movement. We are very proud that Athens Makerspace is the first. The unique aspect of the maker scene in our city is that it shares the Greek idea of the community. People from different organisations want to meet in the same event, have a good time and work on a project together. We give our best to make our city better in any way we can. Fortunately, there are many opportunities for people to make their ideas a reality, share their knowledge and teach others. We understand one another and we also welcome newcomers who really want to learn and be part of the community”. In the centre of Athens there are so many hidden little shops that you can buy handmade objects or materials for your project. Some of them dating decades back. The maker scene here has a beautiful history full of handcrafters that we are trying to uphold.” Andriana, Community Manager, Athens Makerspace
a discussion with the local coworking actors.
Maria, Co-founder The Cube
“It has great potential things are changing, we have been past the hive phase and the community is maturing. The biggest problem is bureaucracy into setting up and running a business in Greece and as I already mentioned brain drain and talent moving abroad seeking for opportunities at this current phase.”
Olga, Co-founder Stone Soup
“I think the scene will become a lot more international. When we started almost 100% of our residents were Greek but now you can see 50% Greek and the other half is a mixture of different nationalities. People come either to live in Athens or to spend some time (1–3 months). The digital nomad paradigm is getting of the ground.”
Andriana, Community Manager, Athens Makerspace
“There are 3 reasons why we believe that in the future more people will prefer making, repairing, upcycling or reusing than buying.
First of, the environmental awareness is currently spreading and thankfully becoming part of our everyday life will be the main reason for that.
Secondly, many makers are finding a way to make a living through their creations ($$$!). And last but not least, despite the above, creative thinking and handmaking is a very important part of life that has been ignored in the past decades. It creates a special bond with all the stuff that surrounds us, adding so much value to everything that is custom-made rather than mass produced. Plus, it is proven to provide some serious psychotherapy in this rapidly evolving world.
We really hope that in the near future, schools will start incorporate the making aspect in their teaching methods. Building mini makerspaces in-school or asking people to do workshops for the students or even have a teacher that specializes in this field. The hands-on education is proven to be an amazing method and we believe that it’s time for schools in Athens to embrace it.
Also something that we notice more and more lately is the increase of women in the maker movement. Right now we have more women working on projects in Athens Makerspace than we ever did. We really hope and believe that this will continue as the social stereotypes that created a gender imbalance in the community, gradually fade.”

My partner and I love to travel! (I mean who doesn’t?) Therefore we decided to visit the magnificent Greek city also known as Athens! You may be sitting there questioning the title, (Cricket, Cricket) and some of you may have guessed by now. Even though Athens is the capital city of Greece and a place that's crowded with shopaholics- the sound of crickets fill the air all day long. However, I am sure the locals are used to it.
When it comes to travelling we always try to budget and can always stick to it! (That is a complete lie.) We think about the places we want to visit and places we want to stay. Wherever in the world you may visit — you do not always get to visit each and every corner of the city, so our top attractions/activities depend on the amount of time we have in that city.
How many days is enough to visit Athens?
The time spent in a city all depends on the reason for visiting. For example you may visit for the beautiful sceneries, the outstanding history or you just love to open up your wallet and get straight into those bougie stores. However, in our case we just wanted to wallow in to delicious food and visit the still standing historical attractions. We had spent just under 2 nights in Athens. That is more than enough time to see the top attractions and indulge in all the finest foods Athens has to offer.
Two nights? Run me through your itinerary…
Sure. We arrived midday of August, and as soon as we landed and stepped foot outside the airport- the August heat lashed onto our skins! This may sound overdramatic- but do bare in mind we are from England and the sun does not do us great favours! As I was saying, the heat was a lot and we had to find transport to reach us to our accommodation. I love to use public transport when we travel to a foreign country and I am slightly against using taxis all the time unless it’s needed. Only because it takes away the enjoyment of feeling what it is like living like a local. However, I did regret this as soon as we reached because :
BUT mainly because
2. Public transport was not looking promising- it was overly crowded and that’s not what you want when you are carrying around your suitcase and a few other bags. So eventually we found a cab (baring in mind this took up to an hour) that took us straight to our accommodation.
Once we reached our apartment — we freshened up and gushed ourselves with sunscreen lotion! (Wearing sunscreen lotion sometimes feels like you are going to war with the sun — I mean you kind of are if you think about it.)
We decided to visit the most famous attractions of Athens first- I mean it would be an insult not to! The Acropolis and The Parthenon. On the way there I was imagining what it would look like — of course I knew the scenery would be beautiful but photos do not do justice — it looked incredible! ( Now for those of you that do not know what the The Acropolis is — well then you will just have to Google it.) It was a sight that caught my eye. Stairs took you straight to the top of the attraction and there you could take in the breath-taking views. (I will leave some helpful tips at the end, so do have a look.)
Next, we were starving — so we decided to take our last few photos and get some lunch/dinner (can we call that chinner?) We wanted to try Greek food- however, when it comes to being a vegetarian it is not that simple, especially in Europe.
First stop: Street Souvlaki — Gyros time! How was it? Personally, I liked it. It was stuffed with aubergine, courgette, halloumi cheese and chips and drizzled with chilli jam. Ok, for those of you that don’t love their vegetables this may not sound appealing — but it was good, I liked it. My husband on the other hand, ‘eh’. For those of you that don’t know what that means, it means, well it means ‘eh’.
Next cheeky stop: crêpes anyone? Yes please! Whatever happens on holiday stays on holiday and in your belly. Dessert is a must on holiday so we found a cute little dessert shop that were making crêpes and the smell dragged us in! We bought a crepe to share, (which we don’t usually do, but hey sharing is caring.) The smell of Nutella tickled by taste buds and to top it of with some Strawberries.
Day 2: Don’t cha wish you girlfriend liked to shop like me? Don’t cha… (no not really)
The above title is giving mixed messages to you all — Yes, Athens is great for shopping — but we visited a few stores and we were done! I guess shopping isn’t for everyone. But for those of you that love shopping the main place to visit would be Ermou Street.
Next, we decided to visit: The Acropolis Museum
Which was filled with historical artefacts from the ancient times. It was fascinating and definitely worth the visit. Below the museum lay a phenomenal ancient civilisation which has been preserved very well. Archaeologists had used the remains of what was found to get an idea of what the different areas were used for.
Lastly, we decided to go for dinner before we called it a night. We decided to fill our bellies with indian food, so we visited Namaste — which is a walking distance from the museum. The food was delicious. Authentic? Yes, very much.
That was all for Athens. Next stop — Naxos! But hey that’s for another day.
Check out the helpful tips below:
2. Keep a hat, sunglasses, water and sunscreen with you at all times. ( if you didn’t guess so already — it gets kind of hot.)
3. I would recommend to book a taxi when arriving in Athens to take you to your accommodation. Taxis were a nightmare to find/contact. (Uber does work in Athens — so we used this. For the rest of your trip you can use public transport but the scheduled times are not always correct.)
4. There is a lot of walking involved when you want to visit the main attractions — I do recommend hiring a car. Unless you love to walk — then go ahead!
5. Greek Salad is amazing! Definitely try it out.
6. Baklava is popular in Greece so I would try this too.

Stepping off the metro and into the sun-drenched streets of Athens feels like opening a history book with the pages still whispering secrets. The air carries a warm, dry breeze laced with the scent of jasmine and grilled souvlaki. You turn a corner, and there it is: the Acropolis, standing guard over the city like an old friend greeting you after years apart.
No photograph truly captures the magic of the Acropolis. The way the Parthenon’s marbled columns glow rose-gold at dusk, or how the ancient stones hum with stories of philosophers and poets cannot be fully conveyed. Standing before this magnificent ancient structure, you can directly feel the wonder created by human creativity and perseverance. The Parthenon, standing firm for 2,500 years, is not merely a building but a symbol of human civilization that transcends time, offering a moment that stays in your heart.
Lose yourself in Plaka, Athens’ old neighborhood nestled at the Acropolis foot. Cobblestone lanes twist between pastel houses draped in bougainvillea, their wobbly pavement echoing every step you take. Every corner reveals a tiny kafenío spilling laughter and card games, a cat sunning itself on a doorstep, or an artisanal shop selling hand-painted ceramics. Stay close to a map, but feel free to get delightfully lost — each turn brings a new discovery.
In Monastiraki, the pulse of modern Athens beats alongside relics of every era. Street musicians serenade you near the flea market, where you can barter for vinyl records, vintage postcards, or a well-loved leather bag. Perch on the marble steps of Hadrian’s Library, feeling centuries-old stones under your fingertips while absorbing the vibrant energy of the streets.
Walking through Athens, you’ll discover the remarkable coexistence of modern and ancient. You might be strolling down a busy shopping street and suddenly encounter the ruins of a Roman-era amphitheater, or see columns of the 2,000-year-old ancient Agora standing right next to a modern coffee shop. Especially at sunset, the ancient ruins take on an almost living quality in the golden light that embraces the city.
With every step, the pavement beneath your feet seems to tell stories of the past. When you place your hand on an old stone wall, the warmth of the stone that has stood in that place for thousands of years creates a connection to the past through your palm. In Athens’ narrow alleyways, echoes sometimes reverberate, sounding almost like the whispers of ancient Greeks.
During my stay, I had the opportunity to visit the historic Piraeus Port on a business trip. As Athens’ main harbor for over 2,500 years, Piraeus offers a fascinating blend of maritime heritage and modern commerce. The bustling port, one of the largest in the Mediterranean, serves as Greece’s gateway to the world and a reminder of the nation’s enduring connection to the sea.
Walking along the waterfront, I watched massive cruise ships and cargo vessels docked alongside traditional fishing boats, their colorful hulls bobbing gently in the harbor. The scent of salt water mingled with the aroma of fresh seafood from tavernas lining the marina. Locals call this area “the heart of Greek shipping,” and it’s easy to see why — the energy here is different from central Athens, more cosmopolitan yet deeply rooted in maritime tradition.
After my meetings concluded, I explored the charming neighborhoods surrounding the port. Mikrolimano, with its horseshoe-shaped marina lined with seafood restaurants, offered stunning views where I watched fishermen mending their nets — a practice unchanged for centuries. In Pasalimani, elegant yachts suggested modern luxury while the nearby Archaeological Museum of Piraeus housed bronze statues recovered from the harbor’s depths, a testament to the port’s ancient significance.
The contrast between Piraeus and central Athens provided a fuller understanding of Greek identity — while the Acropolis represents Greece’s philosophical and cultural heritage, Piraeus embodies its seafaring spirit and commercial prowess that have sustained the nation throughout history.
On my last evening, I climbed Filopappou Hill just as the sun dipped below the Aegean horizon. The city sprawled beneath me — rust-red rooftops giving way to olive groves and distant azure. A street musician began to strum a haunting melody on his bouzouki, each note drifting through the twilight haze. I closed my eyes and let the music, the breeze, the ancient stones all blend together. In that instant, Athens wasn’t just a city of ruins; it was a living masterpiece, forever echoing with the laughter, dreams, and tears of everyone who ever called it home.
Athens isn’t about rushing from one selfie spot to the next. It’s about pausing to feel time fold onto itself — sharing sweet moments with locals at dawn, or watching street life unfold as light dances across the Acropolis. It’s a place that invites you to slow down, to breathe in history, and to savor both the grand and the minute details of daily life. When you leave, you carry a piece of that magic with you — a sense of grounded wonder and the comforting knowledge that some moments are eternal.
Safe travels, dear friend. May your heart be as full as mine was, and may Athens whisper its stories to you, too.

The night I slept in Exarcheia was perhaps the turning point. My phone had been stolen, I had been caught at the airport six times, each time returned. I had even once dyed my hair blond and worn coloured lenses to appear more ‘European’ — it seems so ridiculous now.
In Exarcheia I was surrounded by hashashin, every nation, class and colour united in smoking weed, perhaps the best form of integration there is. It was cold, January 2017, and I was lucky, because it was the only night that I slept outside, unlike so many others.
I woke the next morning and came across another guy, also young like me, with green eyes, from Latakia. He had also slept on the street that night, but he looked so clean I could not believe he was sleeping rough. Seeing him, a guy more or less my age in the same situation, made me realise that I was not alone and that there were so many others like me trying to find a way to survive. After so many failures, sleeping on the street, losing so much money on wasted attempts to smuggle myself out of Greece, I began to understand that this was not the path for me.
That morning at 5am I went to Katekhaki (the Greek asylum service) and I also received my first fine for not paying my metro ticket. I took the fine, smiled, said, ‘efharisto poly’ (thank you very much in Greek) and kept on towards Katekhaki, throwing away the paper fine on the way.
This was the first fine of forty similar fines I would receive over the next two years, thanks to the incredible Greek system of fining people who clearly cannot pay their tickets. As a conscientious member of Greek society now, I pay my monthly transport, but those fines amounted to 1,200 euros. Of course, I never ever thought of that at the time.
Why did I go to Katekhaki? Because six months previously I had not attended my asylum interview — I had been far too focused on the idea of getting out of Greece to find my brother in Sweden. Besides, no one helped you in Greece, there was no accommodation, the only option for me was the squats. It did not feel like a place that offered stability, or a future. But now it seemed like I needed to change my plan, and so I went to Katekhaki and took my asylum card and the date for my interview, which was to be three months later. I returned to Exarcheia, managed to stay in a squat for three days and there met a group of Spanish people who were to offer me my first place to stay.
I began to plan. To me, the most important things was finding a job, and so I thought about what seemed to me to be a previous life, but one that had given me experiences that now I could draw upon.
In Damascus I had always been interested in technology — my brother had bribed me to do well in my exams with the promise of a laptop. He tricked me and gave the laptop to someone else, but then relented and bought me a newer one; he could see how much it meant to me I think.
I had studied technology in college for a while and then in Turkey I had managed to get some work at Vodaphone and had started to study coding. Whenever I needed to learn something I went to one place: youtube. Since Damascus, through Turkey and here in Greece, it is always the place I go to for learning new things, for inspiration and motivation.
I began to work, buying old phones and then mending and updating them and selling them on. I even made money online — just imagine 989 euros in my paypal, untouchable because there was no account for it to be transferred to. No one would accept my Greek Asylum white card as valid ID. I felt as if I was some sort of ethereal phantom, magically working online, but for no material benefit, except for the personal satisfaction of seeing the numbers on the screen and dreaming about what I would do with the money if it was physically in my possession.
Many things have happened since then, many of which we will all experience in our lives as refugees — the struggle to find a job, a home, a way to build a life. I realise I am not unique in this sense and this motivated me to try and help others in any way I can.
For a year I was lucky to be involved with a youth centre which gave me accommodation in exchange for volunteering there. I was always trying to think of new ways of making money within the narrow confines of Greek law where you cannot have a bank account unless you have a job. I helped people write CVs, gave courses on computer software, computer literacy, anything that I felt could be helpful for people like me looking for a future here.
I got a job, went to the training and got 99% on my coding exam, although to be honest it was my third retake. Then the company told me to go home, because the Greek system did not issue my AFM (tax number) fast enough. I tried everything, applying from different offices, with my company (which arranges all the necessary visas, AFMs and accommodation for their foreign workers), on my own, with a Greek person, anything! In the Exarcheia office where I originally registered I went with a Greek friend to check on the progress of my AFM which I had submitted a month previously. Eventually one clerk at the office whispered to my friend, ‘the person you need to talk to is in the toilet. Wait until he comes out and try and get him before he goes into the office.’ A couple of minutes later a large man with an even larger belly waddled out of the toilet, sideways. My friend tried to speak with him, but all she received was a dismissive gesture and a grunt. I had felt as if I had done everything, I had never given up, I had given so much of my time to learning and teaching others and had got this job, only to lose it because of a stupid bureaucracy.
It seems so funny now, looking back on it, because a month after that we returned and I managed to get my AFM, from the same toad-man. It had arrived maybe 10 days after I had visited the first time, but they had never bothered to call me.
In my despair my Greek friend put it in perspective. She too had suffered from this system, it was not specifically discrimination because I was a refugee, but rather an inefficient system that makes it impossible even for ordinary Greeks to do apparently simple things. Obtaining an AFM was my right as someone with residency, I had to be reminded that it would come eventually, that this was part of the journey, even if it felt as if Greece wanted me to personally suffer.
That was two months ago. Now, one AFM, a bank account and a 1,200 euro fine later, I am working as a software developer in a company that I dreamed of working for when I was in Syria. I could not have done this in Germany, France, Belgium or Holland, and so, although I spent so much time and money trying to escape this country, it turns out that this is one of the few places I can actually get the experience I need to continue my career.
What kept me going after that night in Exarcheia, before that in Turkey and Lesvos, was always having a plan and working out how to make it happen. In every situation, even if it is new, or potentially stressful and unfamiliar, I see opportunities to explore, make new contacts, learn something new. I truly believe that anyone can do what I have done, they just need focus, flexibility and a willingness to learn.
Be independent, do not follow the bad habits of others, and recognize that sometimes what works for others may not work for you. Make the most of your time and plan your day, week, month, even your year. Wherever you go there are opportunities to learn. Even in Athens, where I thought there was nothing, there are lots of different places that offer amazing training in languages and other skills.
Live in the present, but always think about the next step, and trust yourself. And use youtube!

Socrates’ borough or deme was Alopece, located in the immediate suburbs of Athens to the southeast. In his constitutional reforms of 508 BC, Cleisthenes identified and distributed the hundred and thirty-nine demes among ten administrative “tribes,” replacing four mutually hostile kinship tribes. He designed the new mapping to break up family dynasties and regional interest groups, so as to force people from different regions of Attica to work together (ch. 2*). The new tribes were given important political functions; for instance, each tribe annually elected a general to serve as one of the commanders of the Athenian armed forces for that year.
Each tribe also contributed fifty members to the Council every year, and each deme received proportionate representation within their tribe’s cohort of members. Socrates’ Alopece, belonging to the tribe of Antiochis, sent ten citizens to the Council annually. Socrates himself would serve his deme as a Council representative in the year 407/6 BC (see ch. 19.4*).
After the deme system was configured based on the geographical location of boroughs in Attica, one’s membership in it became hereditary. Consequently, the son always belonged to the deme of his father, even if he moved to another location and resided within the geographical boundaries of a different deme. In reality, however, people tended to remain in the same villages for centuries, as was often the case in Europe before recent times. Socrates’ deme in the suburbs of Athens was convenient for a man who frequented the city streets, so it seems likely that he continued to live in his ancestral home in Alopece.
When he was eighteen, Socrates was presented to the demarch or borough chairman as a candidate for citizenship. Since the city of Athens kept no vital records, family members and close acquaintances had to swear that he had reached his eighteenth birthday. They also had to swear that his father was a citizen. In the year that Socrates came of age, Pericles pushed through a bill that required that not only a man’s father, but also his mother must be Athenian in order to qualify for citizenship. Socrates must have met the more stringent requirement, for his name was duly entered in the deme’s register of youth eligible for citizenship.
After the deme certified Socrates and his age-mates, they sent the records to the Council, which conducted a review (dokimasia) to verify that the information was correct. After this last step, Socrates would have become a citizen and, therefore, eligible to participate in civic processes, except those with an age requirement. For instance, to hold some offices a citizen must have attained the age of thirty. Public records henceforth would certify his age and thus eligibility for office — and for military service.
Hereafter he was officially known by his “demotic” name, Socrates of Alopece, a designation meant to identify citizens with their boroughs more closely than with their families, so as to counteract the powerful influence of family groups (indicated by the patronymic, for instance, Socrates son of Sophroniscus) on the politics of the city.
Socrates now became a cadet or ephebe (ephēbos), subject to military training and assignment. In the fourth century, cadets received rigorous military training, performed in parades and exhibitions and served in garrisons around the city for two years. Spartan cadets had received rigorous military and survival training from an early time. It is not clear, however, how much formal training Socrates received in his time as a cadet in mid-fifth-century Athens. He may have served on garrison and patrol duty in the city and the borders of Attica but with little formal training.
Fortunately for Socrates, around 451 when he’d come of age, Cimon was invited to return early to Athens from his exile and negotiated a five-year truce with the Spartans whom the great statesman favored (see ch. 2.5*). Cimon then led an expedition to raid Persian territory in Egypt and Cyprus while Socrates was still serving at home as a cadet. About the time Socrates finished his two-year training, Cimon died and a treaty was negotiated with the Persian Empire, initiating a period of relative peace for several years.
As Socrates completed his military training, after having finished his brief formal education some years before, he succeeded at the age of twenty to the estate of an independent citizen in 449. He came of age just at the time when a thoroughgoing democracy was being instituted in Athens for the first time. Socrates would continue his education by participating in a government that called on the talents of all its citizens to carry out its business. As we shall see, Socrates never aimed at political leadership, but he could not escape holding offices or, in what was considered an equally political responsibility, participating in the armed services of Athens. He would serve bravely in the army and would, by chance or by fate, hold the very highest office in the government — for one day.
In Socrates’ time, Athens led the Greek world in drawing on the talents of all its citizens to govern the city. As Pericles would say some eighteen years later in his famous funeral oration, speaking of the comprehensive Athenian experience with excusable pride, “In summary, I declare that our whole city is the school of Greece.”

On a recent trip to Athens, I visited the Niarchos Center, a new cultural complex just south of Athens housing the Greek National Library (GNL) and the Greek National Opera (GNO). The 566 million euro project, designed by architect Renzo Piano, was completed in 2016 by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.
This place is unlike anything else in Athens. Or anywhere really. It really feels like — the future.
A beautiful, glass-clad building gleams over the city with a long reflective canal glimmering by its side.
The modernistic building feeds into an organized labyrinth of small beautiful parks and gardens composed of Mediterranean climate shrubbery.
The complex is free and open to the public to “flaner”, explore, and play.
While we didn’t visit the Opera House or the Library which are both supposedly world-class, we strolled along the outside spaces and walked with our jaws figuratively dropped in awe, impressed by the beauty and detail of all the elements that just seemed — to work. The spaces were clean and well-maintained, but not sterile. People of all ages were walking, children were playing, teenagers were gathering in some of the nooks and crannies but in a fun not sketchy way. There were bike stations that were being used — but not abused.
The element that impressed us the most was the playground — or rather, the playgrounds, with an s. There were multiple “play” spaces for different ages. Even for adults!
For the youngest crowd (10month — 2 years) where we spent the most time, the playground was composed of countless jungle gym structures mostly made of wood — both aesthetic and functional. There was a manual lever system spewing water to play with. The kids ran around barefoot laughing and screaming. The parents were sitting on the benches around, relaxed. It was the best playground I’ve ever seen.
And again, it was that perfect balance between clean (but not sterile feeling) and utilised. A resonant sweet spot. I imagine this usage is every parks and recreation enthusiast’s dream. Occasionally we’d see a security or maintenance person walk by. So we knew that this beautiful fragile equilibrium was maintained by a very well-planned and methodical “back office”.
Now apparently, the privately-owned complex is to be donated to the Greek state and publicly-run. And the big question that everyone is asking is — can this fragile sweet spot persist if the complex is run by the state?
The doubt is founded — especially when you visit the numerous public parks across Athens which are abandoned and dilapidated with defunct playgrounds. And though some parks like the Pedion tou Areos are lush and quite beautiful, they are coined as “dangerous” as pockets of “immigrants, drug addicts, and radicals” inhabit the spaces. So families will tend to avoid these parks.
As a new parent, I’ve only recently been attuned to the huge importance of parks and green spaces in cities.
The contrast between the Niarchos Center and the Pedion tou Areos is flagrant — and frustrating. With the Niarchos Center, you see that the harmonious populated park CAN work. But why doesn’t it work — with a beautiful park right in central Athens?
This being said, the Pedion tou Areos has a certain charm. A charm that actually artist communities seem to be drawn to. And these communities want to engage people to the park’s alluring ecosystem.
So how do we find that right mix to create a sustainable harmonious park space for all ages to feel free, safe, and relaxed?
Is it a question of public versus private management? Top-down or bottom-up planning?
We’ll be back in a couple months to see if and how things have evolved with both parks.
And back to the Niarchos Center, we haven’t even explored the intricate ecological design of the complex — with 10,000m2 of solar panels and the labyrinth of parks and gardens that I’ve alluded to that serve as a roof garden for the building.
Athens is such a rich, complicated, juxtaposing city — I imagine an urban planner’s heaven and hell.
But in any case, if you go to Athens, make sure to visit the Niarchos Center. AND the Pedion tou Areos park.

Beyond Mykonos, Santorini, Crete, and even Athens, there is much more to Greece than these touristy destinations. Three small day-trip islands you should visit next time you visit Greece are Aegina, Hydra, and Poros. Each island off the coast of Greece has a unique history because the city-states of modern-day Greece were not unified until the mid-17th century, following the Greek revolution against the Ottoman empire.
Aegina is one of the closest islands to the coast of Athens. From Piraeus port, the island is a short forty-five minuet to hour ferry ride. The water surrounding Aegina is very clean, thus home to sea urchins. Don’t let them deter you, just use caution when swimming in the shallow pebbled water surrounding the coast because the views are well worth the swim. Paralia Marathona beach is a short drive from the port, and the views from the beach of nearby islands look like a scene from Jurassic park. The mountains jut out of the water just a few kilometers away, covered in greenery, and appear untouched. When in Aegina you must visit the Temple of Aphena, which is about a 15-minute drive from the port. The temple is the second best-preserved temple in all of Greece, and directly faces the city of Athens. The island of Aegina is also known for being one of the few places in Greece that grows pistachios. When returning to the port, it is paramount that you try any number of the many pistachio products sold downtown. My favorite was the pistachio butter which tasted exactly like Nutella. Some friends of mine loved the pistachio liquor, which I recommend asking to try but wasn’t my favorite.
My second favorite day-trip island is Hydra, which is about a two-hour ferry ride from Athens. Hydra is a very small, narrow island that does not permit cars, motorcycles, or ATVs of any kind. So you will find donkeys lining the port, awaiting to carry travelers and their luggage up the mountainside. Hydra does have beaches, but they are only accessible by boat on the opposite side of the island from the port. There are cliff-jumping sites that line the rest of the coast. Apart from swimming, there is an island museum and a golden star art structure you can view from the coast side, which is a short walk from the port. Hydra also has cliffside bars and cafes with some of the best views I have seen in Greece. I highly recommend getting breakfast or dinner and taking in the views for a few hours because they are what Instagram is made of.
My third island recommendation is Poros, which like Aegina, is also about an hour ferry ride from the Piraeus port. The views from Athens to Poros are unmatched. You pass many seaside cliffs, and uninhabited islands and may even see some dolphins as I did. The water changes from deep blue to bright seafoam green along the way and is some of the clearest, brightest, saltiest water I have ever swam in. Upon our arrival to Poros, we witnessed a greek wedding take place just off the coast on a tiny island that was just big enough for a church and about fifty standing guests. The port town is quiet and faces another costal town of the mainland less than a kilometer away, creating a natural canal. The townspeople are extremely hospitable and grateful for our small purchases. These islands also heavily rely on tourism for revenue but receive much less foot traffic than the better-known islands. After browsing the shops, we followed the clock tower signs through the mountainside homes to the highest point of Poros. At the top, we were welcomed with an amazing sunset view of the surrounding islands. Because Poros is a much smaller island, their souvenirs were very cheap, so I stalked up on postcards, a new towel, and some sunglasses before we headed back to Athens.
I have found that these smaller islands just off the coast of the mainland are much more affordable, welcoming, and just as stunning as the well-known islands of Mykonos, Santorini, and Crete. Greece is all about taking a step out of the hustle and bustle of life, so I encourage everyone to take a few day trips to the quiet and forgotten islands and truly get a feel for the authentic greek culture.

As a follow up to last week’s blog (on the ‘nod of recognition’) I want to reflect on how to connect with different demographics in our preaching.
Francis Schaeffer talked about Lystra and Athens and Romans chapter 1:18–32 as Paul ‘addressing the world without a Bible’.
In all these places Paul is addressing a common religious consciousness that is found in every society and every person. This religious consciousness is articulated differently from person to person, and sometimes it is not articulated at all.
In Acts Paul tackles people without a Bible is very different ways. In the best known of these sermons he preaches in Athens to intellectuals who were used to expressing and evaluating new ideas (Acts 17), using careful reasoning and making use of well-chosen cultural references to connect with his target audience.
Dan Strange, in his book Plugged In, describes the process of Paul’s preaching in Athens using four E’s:
Enter — Explore — Expose — Evangelise
Strange’s pattern reminds the preacher that before speaking there is a need to observe and listen in each situation. Preachers are taught to carefully exegete Scripture, but they are not always taught to exegete their audiences. Both these tasks are important if we are to communicate effectively.
It is important to note that both here and in Lystra, Paul does not quote any biblical text, but his sermons in both places are underpinned by a scriptural God-centred worldview.
What is interesting is that Paul’s approach in Athens is very different from what we see Lystra. He does not preach in the same way to a farming community as he does to the philosophers in Athens.
In Athens Paul uses careful reasoning and quotes from poets and philosophers; in Lystra, by contrast, he makes use of more common place points of contact such as the cycles of the seasons and patterns of sunshine and rainfall. These were the things that preoccupied the thinking of those who lived in a rural community that was dependant on the land.
The key for the preacher in Paul’s flexible strategy is that from the same basic theological premise that the Lord God is the creator and sustainer of all, he preaches a distinct message to these very different communities. In this way Paul sought to connect with the reality that God has put eternity into our hearts.
Coming back to the four E’s, I would guess that most preachers are well-practiced in the art of exposing and evangelising, but fewer are experienced at entering and exploring.
Entering and exploring involve taking a deep dive into cultural context in which we are preaching. This involves getting a feel for the things that engage a particular congregation.
Time spent asking good questions and listening carefully to the congregation will always be repaid in the ability to connect with people more effectively.
Good preachers understand Scripture and understand people.
Different genres of Scripture require different handling. You cannot preach a Psalm in the same way you preach on a letter.
Different congregations also require different handling. It is worth asking of your congregation, “Is this more like Lystra or Athens, or is it something in between?”

Kea, part of the Cyclades islands in Greece, is a quiet getaway not far from Athens. Unlike its busy neighbors like Mykonos, Kea offers a peaceful retreat with lovely beaches and small, friendly villages.
Once you arrive, the scenic harbor of Korissia welcomes you. A short trip takes you to Ioulida, the island’s capital, where you can stroll through old pathways and see an ancient stone lion from the 6th century BC.
Food lovers will enjoy Kea’s fresh seafood and local dishes, like “paspala”, a tasty pork dish. For the adventurous, there are trails to explore the island’s natural beauty, leading you through olive groves and to hidden beaches like Spathi and Koundouros.
Kea is a place to relax, enjoy good food, and discover nature’s charm, all without straying too far from the bustling city life of Athens.

Today, we think of true and false as natural opposites, but this set of antonyms did not emerge until the philosopher Plato framed them as such [1]. For the Greeks before Plato, ‘true and hidden’ and ‘correct and false’ were the natural pair of opposites in language. Truth and falsehood are, for us today, a matter of representing the world one way or another because, for us, language is a matter of representing the world in one way or another. Thus:
But language before the widespread prevelance of literacy did not function as a means of representing the world. Rather, language functioned by either showcasing or concealing something. Unlike for us today, for the early Athenians:
In early Greek culture (and many other indigenous cultures — think of Vedic chants, native poetry), people spoke in memorable, formulaic, and repetitive patterns so that information could be easily learned and remembered. As rhetorical critic Walter J. One states — this was possible by ‘saying over and over again what has been learned arduously over ages.’ In that context, it would have been risky to say something different, to play with the language, or to innovate because to do so would run the risk of losing knowledge that had been painstakingly collected over centuries. The world before the written language was an oral world (as opposed to a literate world), and the experience of hearing language was totally different for those audiences. In the oral world, hearers empathized with speakers and participated in the scenes their words evoked. There was a tangible sense of commonality that spread through the experience of sound that was shared by speakers and hearers alike. Sound comes from within one person’s body and enters another person’s body. As Ong puts it, in oral cultures where words exist only and exclusively as sounds, ‘with no reference whatsoever to any visually perceptible text, and no awareness of even the possibility of such a text, the phenomenology of sound enters deeply into human beings’ feel for existence, as processed by the spoken word.’ All of this dramatically changed with the introduction of the widespread use and understanding of writing.
Sophists and the written language
Literacy changed people’s relationship to language, and by changing their relationship to language, it changed their relationship to truth. With the spread of literacy, poetry no longer needed to carry the hefty responsibility of preserving the knowledge of an entire culture. Rather than be swept up in the rhythmic tide of a poem as sung by a bard, Greeks in Plato’s time could read it themselves. Whereas prior to literacy, people may have had an intuitive sense that language referred to the world, after the rise of literacy they had an explicit theory to explain how language related to the world. Once that happened, it became possible to think of truth as representational and symbolic in the same way. It was Plato who essentially invented a new understanding of language as representing the world, rather than functioning to bring something to light so it could be perceived. And he did so for explicitly political reasons.
Plato felt that the truth problem in the tricky politics of the war with Sparta was caused by a group of wealthy and influential statesmen — the Sophists. Plato had no shortage of bad things to say about the Sophists, in part because, even though they were not from Athens, they nevertheless wielded terrific influence in the city-state. So much so, that today, we use the term Sophist to refer to one who uses slippery language to twist truth for his or her own political gain. So, how did the Sophists wield language to such a powerful effect before the written word became more widespread? The Sophists came to Athens from all corners of ancient Greece and made a fortune by giving speeches and by teaching others how to speak on topics where they would often not have any knowledge at all. They dazzled the Athenians with their style and ability to persuade practically anybody of anything. Some of Athens’s most prominent citizens — Pericles, Callias and Alcibiades — paid large sums of money for getting trained by the Sophists. This allowed Sophists to gain great political influence, but not for the benefit of Athenians, rather, for the benefit of their own home cities. The undercurrents of the beginning of the end were already starting to brew.
If you were to ask a Sophist who they were and what they did — they would say that they were international intellectuals and teachers in the arts of language and speaking. But if you were to ask the Athenian survivors, who was to most blame for the fall of Athens — they wouldn’t say Sparta or the tyrants. They would point to the Sophists who taught Athenians how to make convincing arguments for things that were simply not true.
To give a sense of what the Sophists were capable of, consider the case of the two brothers — Euthydemus and Dionysodorus — who managed to convince their opponent that it is impossible to tell a lie as follows: they first got him to agree that no one can make something that is not — because things that ‘are not’ do not exist; then they got him to agree that speaking is a kind of making; finally, they got him to agree that telling a lie is speaking what ‘is not’! Similarly, Gorgias convincingly argued that nothing exists as follows:
‘It is easy to conclude that both the existent and non-existent do not exist either. For if the non-existent exists and the existent exists, the non-existent will be the same thing as the existent as far as existence is concerned. And for this reason neither of them exists. Of course, if the existent is the same as the non-existent, it is not possible for both to exist. For if both exist, they are not the same, and if the same, both do not exist. To which the conclusion follows that nothing exists. For if neither the existent exists not the non-existent nor both, and if no additional possibility is conceivable, nothing exists!’
With their training, the Sophists convinced Callias and Alcibiades to speak on the Athenian floor, for a battle with Sparta in Sicily to free the Sicilians from Spartan control. This simple hypnotizing act caused the Athenian navy to self-destruct, lose 50,000 oarsmen, and eliminated an entire generation of fighters. Callias lost his family’s entire fortune and died penniless, while Alcibiades was banished from Athens, and Sparta installed the Thirty Tyrants in Athens, who brought democracy to an end by 404 BC, nearly 2500 years ago.
Plato thus needed to develop a different understanding of truth and language precisely so that the verbal tricks of the Sophists would not easily succeed any longer. For, to the Sophists, truth was roughly equivalent to success at winning an argument. This meant that it was very difficult to determine what made true speech true in and of itself, because truth could only be determined in the specific context by who won and who lost. Truth was limited to a particular contest between verbal combatants.
When truth shape-shifted to help the narrative
In a strange way, as the written word spread, it meant that knowledge was no longer hard-won, precious or fragile, so there was no need to scrupulously conserve it. In the pre-literary Athens, opponents accepted defeat precisely because their speech was inseparable from themselves — it was an extension of their own body and soul. Because they thought of language in this way, people were personally committed to the things they uttered. The victorious words were considered true not because of how accurately they represented reality but because, at the end of the fight, they had remained standing — like in a fight between wrestlers. Though the victor silenced his opponent’s words, he didn't disprove them. This was the problem Plato had with this form of truth. As the war with Sparta demonstrated, it was possible for a wrong position to defeat or silence a right one. Plato wanted to create a form of truth that would allow what he considered to be a wrong position to be disproved once and for all. To do this, language had to be detached from both speakers and the world. It had to become representational.
Plato and Alcibiades were critical of writing, although they were adept at using it, because they felt that it was facile and readily available. Alcibiades had high praise for people who could speak in the moment —
‘For speaking on the spot in a fitting way about whatever presents itself, and employing a swift richness of argument and vocabulary, and following with a sure track the critical moment in affairs and people’s inclinations, and using appropriate language is not a universal natural gift nor does it come from just any sort of training.’
In other words, extemporaneous speakers can respond in a more authentic and truthful way to the audience that is immediately in front of them. Extemporaneous speakers reveal themselves to their audience rather than hide behind a prefabricated speech.
In the minds of many Athenians, including Plato, the Sophists were the first to figure out how to create an alternate reality using only words, and so they were the reason that words had become detached from reality in the first place. Words may be in the world, but they most certainly are not of it, according to Gorgias. He was demonstrating how, although we may be naturally and intuitively inclined to believe that words represent reality, in fact, words refer only to other words. And when we use words to negate or contradict other words, that affects how we view reality itself — even though the only thing we are negating and contradicting is other words. This is how conspiracy theories manage to spread and thrive because we have a hard time separating the medium of the words where the denial is happening from the facts they supposedly deny. In the 5th century BCE, Gorgias understood this far better than we do today: he knew that, in a contest between facts and contradiction, contradiction wins every time. For this reason, supplying more and more facts seldom results in re-establishing the truth, once and for all. Instead of throwing more and better facts at our truth problems, Gorgias would have us become more aware of the medium of words themselves and, in particular, of words that deny or negate reality.
The power of the fabricated language
The term media literally means that something mediates between the hard facts of reality and our knowledge of those facts. Understanding the medium of words, as Gorgias may have been trying to show early Athenians is something that we must strive to do today as we struggle with not only existing disinformation, but now also with the new capacity for generated disinformation at scale through large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (genAI).
This highlights the biggest difference between Plato’s truth problem and our own today: his was silence without disproof, while our post-truth problem is disproof without silence. This is where Plato’s reformulation has come back to bite us. Language has become detached from us as it is from the world it represents. So we can say anything we want, and if we find we have contradicted ourselves or said something inconsistent, it is of very little concern to us. We can always delete a tweet, take down a post and deny that we ever said those words in the first place, or say something else. We can keep talking and talking, long after we’ve been disproven. This goes a long way toward explaining why truth has increasingly become so difficult for us to grasp today. This is also what makes it dangerous. Ancient rhetoricians acknowledged that both forms of truth were powerful tools for creating belief. This ancient oral notion of truth is re-animated when people speak spontaneously in an authentic and in-the-moment way.
Protagoras knew that stories could be more persuasive and powerful than straightforward arguments because, in a very uncertain world where it can be difficult to determine what is true, narratives give us something to hold on to. They have a sticking capacity. For example, the story of Prometheus and Epimetheus was precisely constructed by Protagoras to counter Socrates’s argument that virtue is something one is born with. The story did not need to prove the point, but only to engross his audience enough where the point would seem to be proven in the context of the story itself. This is the rhetorical power of stories and narratives — their words shape how we see and experience the world we live in. Stories effectively create a screen on reality, a screen that highlights some aspects of reality and obscures others. Stories are the houses that words build to give us the momentary experience of surety that everything in flux can pause for a moment for us to understand it. The problem arises when we don’t recognize stories as stories, when we mistake their relatively stable screen on reality for reality itself. When reality is mediated to us and when we attempt to mediate reality for others, it tends to happen in the form of a story. Oftentimes, those stories are far less recognizable as stories than the one Protagoras told. This is getting exceedingly more difficult in the era of generative AI.
Language as we know it today
After WWII, Kenneth Burke, the American literary theorist, tried to device a five-part method he called the pentad (act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose), as a means to understand how people package reality, as a means to weed out ideologies like the one that had just given rise to the war and had blindly cajoled people to commit horrendous acts. Burke believed that understanding tools of rhetoric like the pentad would make people less vulnerable to stories that package dubious political ideologies and propaganda. Long before the internet age and the impact of social media in our current age, Burke foresaw the confusion, cynicism, and manipulation made possible by the incessant flood of information. With all the new ‘information’ being generated by AI, we can only expect the ride ahead to be more turbulent.
Language is constantly shaping how we see the world. By extrapolation, large language models will shape how the world appears to us — not always in a good manner. What Protagoras would have liked us to likely see today, is that if we change the language, we’re changing the way we measure reality. When we use language, it is something that happens through us more than something we consciously choose by deliberately selecting what to say or how to say it. It is the larger structure of language that is in control, not us. That is what the 20th-century Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure meant when he said language eludes the control of our will. Language is in charge; we’re along for a ride. In other words, our use of language is guided by implicit and non-obvious rules of meaning. We inherited these structures and never observed them while they were taking shape. And yet, we are necessarily guided and constrained by those systems.
In her book Reames discusses a simple experiment that she conducted where she asked students in her class to arrange their desk in a circle [1]. They all complied. When she asked why, they said because she was the teacher. When dug a bit deeper, they realized how there was a much larger structure behind their compliance. It’s not only that Reames was their teacher, but that they needed thus good grades, to get a job, to earn money, to sustain a family, to retire in peace. They may have felt like autonomous agents at the point when they stood up to move their desk, but by the end of the class, they didn’t see it that way. This is structuralism. Do we make conscious choices guided by deliberate rationality and practical wisdom? Or are we guided by the system of meanings our psyche has absorbed, without being fully aware of it? Are the things we think as cool, funny, beautiful, sublime, sacred so deemed because of our consciously cultivated preferences? Or is it that a larger network of cultural symbols infuses perception with its norms and values without our conscious attention?
Plato may have been the Sophists’ greatest foe. He wanted to give people the tools to escape from their own ignorance where truth and reality were concerned, which was precisely what had made them susceptible to the Sophists’s way of untruths and lies. Think of the allegory of Plato’s cave. So, are we entering an era of genAI as the new Sophists? Is it a platform that is wielding large amounts of power over the psyche of the masses? Was the Athenian debacle a foreboding of what was to come 2500 years from then? How can LLMs and genAI affect this perception of truth today?
Surely, LLM and genAI have great things to contribute to our future. But given how easy it is to develop our perception of reality from the language we get to know of, it behoves us as engineers and scientists working on AI, and civic society members being exposed to it, to be aware of the pitfalls of being swayed by language and narratives, especially those coming from a species not our own.

If you’re fortunate enough to be heading to the historical city of Athens, Greece and are hoping for some delicious vegan food, you’ll be happy to know you’ll be spoilt for choice. From satisfying street food, to delicious desserts, Athens has a lot to offer in the way of vegan food and I had a fantastic time exploring that.
Actually before I get in to the restaurant recommendations, I have a few tips on how to find vegan food in Athens or anywhere really.
38 Athanasiou Diakou & Kallirois, Athina 117 43
Veganaki was my first stop during my trip. They sell a variety of Mediterranean dishes such as feta cheese, tzatziki, falafel and moussaka.
I had the vegetable oven-baked omelette, served with cashew cheese and salad. Soutzoukakia (traditional meatballs) made of chickpeas and mint, soy tzatziki and wedges. Both delicious and a great start to my week eating my way through the vegan restaurants of Athens. I also tried the apple pie cake which is literally a cake made of pastry and filled with apple pie filling- it was a little strange but really yummy.
Vegan Vandal is one of the best street food spots in Athens, amongst other things they offer burgers, nuggets and even a few cocktails. I tried the Eggplant Pita and Mushroom Skewer. Both hit the spot and I would order them again, although it was here that I learned the importance of a napkin at the bottom of any Greek street food. Cut to me with sauce all over my trousers- totally worth it!
23 Leoforos Athinas, Athina 105 54
Falafel House is a blink and you’ll miss it takeaway spot that sells well falafel. They’re a fully vegetarian restaurant with a few vegan options. I tried 3 of their wraps, the Mexican, the Original and the Babaganouj. I’m honestly not sure which one was my favourite, but I can say this, deep fried falafel is a game changer.
Next up lets talk pizza and more importantly Peynirli, boat shaped pizza. I can’t explain why but it’s just better boat shaped! Smak offers a few different choices for vegans- truffle, hummus, avocado, and pesto. I had the Truffle (Fresh mushrooms, Vegan cheese, Truffle oil, Garlic and baby spinach) & Pesto (Vegan cheese, San Marzano tomato sauce, Vegan pesto, Cherry tomatoes, Capers) Peynirli. Both were fantastic but if I had to pick I’d say the Truffle just edged it for me, but I am a truffle lover so that’s to be expected.
Themistokleous 43–45, Athina 106 83
Cookoomela were the pioneers for vegan souvlaki in Athens. So it may surprise you to know that I didn’t actually try the Souvlaki (I’m told it’s delicious). I wanted to try a variety of vegan options so from Cookoomela I had the Dakos salad, which is a salad made of rusks, tomatoes, avocado, almond cheese, capers and extra virgin olive oil with a deconstructed lentil soutzoukakia kebab plus extra wedges that were great but definitely not needed! I ordered this through the Wolt app, and I was happy to find out that all the packaging is biodegradable. Actually Athens do pretty well when it comes to plastic free and biodegradable packaging.
Maragkou 19, Glyfada 166 75
Speaking of biodegradable/compostable packaging. On my day trip to Glyfada beach, I followed up my glorious swim in the ocean with a quick lunch from AVIT. I had the mushroom gyros wrap & an iced oat latte- now I’m not very keen on Greek coffee, but the wrap was delicious and super cheap.
Agorakritou 32, Athina 104 46
I didn’t actually visit Treis Laloun until my final night in Athens, which was a shame as they have so much choice I would have loved to sample some more of the menu. This fully vegan restaurant offers dishes such as Caesar salad, fries with cheddar and bacon, chicken free a la creme, carbonara, meatless skepasti, schnitzel, plus so much more. I had the Tarragon & fennel shrimp with wild rice and got to try the seitan steak with mushrooms. The shrimp was potentially my favourite meal in Athens, the sauce was delicious and like nothing I’d had before.
21 Eolou Aghias Irinis Square, Athina 105 51
Lukumades do 1 thing and they do it well- Loukoumades (Greek doughnuts). They have a few vegan options to fill (or cover) your Loukoumades with. These include icing sugar, bitter chocolate, peanut butter, agave syrup, apple pie, and chocolate praline. In the week I was in Athens I went to Lukamedes three times and that still wasn’t enough! I tried, peanut butter with chocolate praline, apple pie and the “Vegano” which is made with chocolate sorbet ice cream, vegan chocolate praline, peanut butter, and almonds.
Patousa 4 near Platia Kaniggos, Athina 106 77
Whilst we’re on the subject of desserts, let me finish this post by talking about Cats & Monsters. This 100% vegan ice cream shop has a variety of delicious flavours that you can enjoy in a cone or cup. They’ve got your classics such as strawberry and chocolate chip as well as some more interesting flavours like pear with feta and apple pie. They also specify the type of plant milk used for each ice cream. I tried strawberry brownie, hazelnut bueno, praline rocher and tiramisu, all delicious- but I think my favourite was bueno, this was one of my favourite chocolates in my pregan( pre vegan) days and I can confirm this was spot on.
Those are the vegan options I checked out during my time in Athens, but there was still a lot more I didn’t get round to trying. Check out Happy Cow for the full list of vegan restaurants in Athens and enjoy your time in Athens, I certainly did!

I don’t think I know of anyone who does not have Greece on their bucket list of places to visit. I’ve long wanted to see it in person.
Part of my “excuse” for visiting Greece was that there is a class tie-in as one of the classes I was taking was Style and Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Of course, the study of rhetoric necessarily involves some discussion of ancient Greece. As it turns out, there was also a link to the history class I am currently taking in that one of the required readings involves torture in Greece following a coup in 1967. Not that I needed an excuse to visit Greece, but hey, it made the decision every so slightly easier.
Nighttime view from the hotel. Not bad at all. Like most tourists, I knew that the Acropolis would need to be on the short list of things to see, but I honestly had no idea it would be this easy to enjoy from the hotel. This was not planned, just a lucky choice when the room was selected online.
Among the surprises on this visit was just how much there is to see without ever leaving the proximity of the Acropolis. Of course, you want to venture out and see more of the city and even get out of Athens and see the rest of Greece. But you could have a rich travel experience without ever going more than a few hundred meters from the Acropolis. In addition to the Parthenon atop the Acropolis itself, there are many other historically-relevant sites that sit alongside the base of the hill. For example, while walking to the Acropolis from my hotel, I passed the Odeon of Pericles, the Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the Stoa of Eumenes, the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, the Sanctuary of Asclepius, and I am sure other significant sites I was not even aware of.
Full disclosure, this was a total vacation, and while I used school as an “excuse” to go to Greece, there was very little by way of study, but still, to see the birthplace of so much of Western Civilization was a fantastic growth experience.
– One of the Greatest Runs of My Life –
One of my favorite ways to learn my way around a new place is to start running. I sometimes have to be careful to pick a significant terrain feature, tall building, or another landmark to use in finding my way back home. Fortunately, for this one, there was the Acropolis. I only had to remember which side was facing my hotel.
I didn’t plan this run out very well, and it was only sheer dumb luck that I happened to be on the western side of the Acropolis just as the sun was rising behind it. This is shown in the featured image that opens this blog post. This view alone made this trip worth the time it took to get here. Most of Athens was soundly sleeping at this time, and I felt as if I had these scenes all to myself.
Agoraphobia — The fear of public spaces. The agora (/ˈæɡərə/; Ancient Greek: ἀγορά agorá) was a central public space in ancient Greek city-states. The literal meaning of the word is “gathering place” or “assembly”. The ancient agora in Athens, with its amazing view of the Acropolis, is not only beautiful, but it is also one of the richest historical sites in Western Civilization. Here is, among other sites, the Temple oh Hephaestus (5th century BCE).
– Amazing things can be built with enough time and dedication –
Most of us have some understanding of the ancient nature of Athens. It is sometimes easy to forget; however, just how old it really is. Ancient Greek civilization starting with the Greek Dark Ages, through antiquity, runs roughly from 1200 BCE up to around 600 CE. So, when we think of ancient Greece, we are not only talking about something long ago, but also something that lasted a long time.
The deep time inherent in Greek civilization allowed for some pretty amazing feats of architecture. Consider the Temple of Olympian Zeus, for example. While visiting this, the largest temple in the ancient world, I couldn’t help but marvel at how people so long ago, without the aid of modern technology, could build something so amazing. It was only later that I learned that construction on this temple began under the Athenian tyrants in the 6th century BCE and was not completed until the 2nd century CE — 638 years after construction began!
Things that I already knew about Greece so not surprising but still interesting: We owe democracy, philosophy, theater, the art of rhetoric, the Olympic games, and some of the world’s most amazing food to Greece. What I didn’t expect to see in Greece? Streets lined with orange trees, marble streets, and the word music, which comes from the Muses, or mythological goddesses of the arts.
As a self-described travel junkie and collector of stamps in my passport, I often avoid going to the same place multiple times, though there are exceptions to this rule. Greece is one of these exceptions and I definitely plan to see it again and more extensively.

I responded to a call about a domestic disturbance and found Oberon, King of the Fairies; the shrewd and knavish sprite Robin Goodfellow (also known to me as Puck); and several members of Oberon’s party engaged in a verbal dispute with Titania, Queen of the Fairies, and several members of her party.
Oberon and Titania accused each other of infidelity. Titania also accused Oberon of ecological extortion. Oberon did not deny the allegations and said his actions were to punish Titania for stealing his henchman, a little changeling boy who was not present.
I contacted Child Protective Services who reported Oberon and Titania are not blood relatives of the child in question, and neither has a legal claim of custody. CPS further informed me the child is currently in India with his biological parents.
I relayed these facts to the disputants and advised them to avoid each other until the situation cools down.

I responded to calls from an owl, spotted snakes, thorny hedgehogs, newts and blindworms, spiders, beetles, and a snail who complained that fairies were harassing and threatening…

I am the author of the book Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life. I thought I’d share with you all a bit more about who I am and one of the main questions that I’ve been grappling with for years, along with the spirit with which I hope to approach this question and our relationship as writer and reader.
“What hath Athens to do with Jerusalem?” This question was originally asked by Tertullian, a Roman citizen in Carthage, Africa, who lived from 155–240 AD. He started out as a student of Stoicism, the most popular philosophy of his day, and he is now known by some as the father of Western theology.
His question (“What hath Athens to do with Jerusalem?”) was not referring to geographic places. It was referring to the relationship between philosophy (symbolized by Athens) and spirituality (symbolized by Jerusalem), or the relationship between reason and faith; the relationship between those things that we can know with our minds alone, and those that require different modes of knowing — truths which are not accessible to us through reason alone.

I think it was sometime in the fall of 2014 that I found out about a young minister who felt like God wanted him to start a brand new church in Columbus. Being the same age and in the same profession, I was intrigued by his plan. My wife and I had recently felt a similar leading to join a new church in Illinois. Our plan was to learn how to start a church also during an 18 month period since we weren’t sure where we would end up after our church-planting residency. The only question I had for Aaron Lentz when hearing about his plan was, “Why Columbus?”
In some people’s minds, the last thing we need in Columbus is another church. There’s already so many great congregations in our community that currently meet people’s spiritual needs. Don’t we have somewhere between over 100 churches in Bartholomew County? What was pulling Lentz and a group of his friends to start another church in already “saturated Christian market”?
To zoom out for a minute from Columbus, every church was once a brand new church. Some people forget this important fact. For whatever reason, this just escapes people’s brains. The other thing that I think is important for people to understand before we move on is the difference between a church (building) and a church (group of people). I don’t think it’s the time to go into the original meaning of these words in the biblical languages of Greek and Hebrew, but I’ll sum it up this way so we’re all on the same page.
The last thing any community needs is another church (building). Every community can use more churches (groups of people) though.
At the heart of “Why Columbus?” are three reasons that I’ve heard from Lentz each time we have talked.
(The Call, The Need, and The Potential were copied and pasted from www.athenscolumbus.com)
The Call
After seeking the Lord in prayer and asking for discernment, we are certain that Columbus is it! We are trusting that the Lord will bring people to Himself in Columbus and what a humbling privilege it is to be a part of what God is doing in this city to glorify Himself.
The Need
There is a great need for gospel-preaching churches in Columbus. There are 105 churches for the 76,794 residents of Bartholomew County. With the average church reaching approximately 125 people, that means that there is 1 church for every 731 people.
The Potential
With Columbus being the home of a number of internationally known companies such as Cummins Engine Company, individuals from across the globe venture to Columbus to make it their home; God is bringing the nations to Columbus. This church plant will reach beyond the scope of Bartholomew County — it will reach the world! Columbus is an attractive, award-winning city home of architectural sights, a number of resources, and numerous opportunities for employment. These accolades contribute to Columbus’ reputation of being a city of great influence. As Columbus is impacted by the gospel of Jesus, it’s influence will spread to the surrounding cities and beyond! With Columbus being a city of world-renown wonders, an increasing housing market and numerous employment opportunities, Columbus is a place of influence and potential. Athens Church will be the first location of a church-planting movement. It is our desire to see the Great Commission advanced as disciples of Christ are made and more gospel-preaching churches are planted.
Here are 5 reasons I’m excited about the launching of Athens Church this Sunday.
1. Athens Church loves Columbus
When you talk to Lentz, you can tell how much he loves his hometown. He understands the importance of Cummins and diversity to our community. He appreciates the arts and education that make our city so special. He embodies the small town family morals and values that allow our Hoosier town to continue to shine.
While I don’t think it’s easy for anyone to start a new church, many of the group at Athens are from our community. This will allow them to connect with people, places, and businesses that otherwise might take “outsiders” longer time to build relationships with. I’m honestly excited to see how this will translate to community impact and numerical growth. Although numbers aren’t central to Lentz’s mission at Athens, every number has a name and every name matters to God.
2. Athens Church is all about the Capital “C” Church
Sometimes when a new church begins, they make it sound like they are the cool church, or the best church, or the only church in their marketing. When I talk to Lentz, he reiterates over and over how much God is already doing in Columbus. He wants people to know that Athens Church is just another group of people trying to make a positive difference in our community for God.
The last thing he wants is to make it sound like their church is competing with others. Lentz’s hope is that they can partner with other churches to reach more people in our community for God. Athens wants to be another part of Christ’s team in Columbus. (The Capital C Church refers to Jesus Christ’s Church, not one particularly church)
3. Athens Church will reach people who are not already going to a church
One of the cool things about Athens Church is that they are beginning their public worship services at Yes Cinema in Downtown Columbus. After working for a year at a church that met in a local school, I’ve experienced the reality that people who are curious about Christianity will visit a school before coming to a church building. A new church like Athens is going to draw initial attention from people in the community are searching for a place to explore faith.
I also love their idea of renting a public space for church gatherings because the money will go directly back into the community. Athens is generating additional revenue for a local business that offers a mutually beneficial financial situation. It also allows people to not get distracted by how great a building is and instead focus on why they are at the space.
4. Athens Church gives people an opportunity to serve
If a church is beginning with the right motives, they will focus on developing new people in church leadership instead of stealing the experienced veterans from other congregations. I’m really impressed by a few conversations about leadership development at Athens. By starting a new church, people who otherwise would have waited for years to serve get an opportunity to experience it on the front lines each week.
Athens Church also plans on being a church that serves Columbus. This might sound like a “duh” to readers who are a part of church culture but saying it and doing it are two totally different things. I’m looking forward to seeing how Athens plans to be a church of the community that meets local needs.
5. Athens Church is all about Jesus
Jesus Christ is the central figure of the Bible. Therefore, Athens Church believes that he should be the central figure in our lives as well. As a church this is why you might hear them often use the word “Gospel” in everything they do.
The Gospel simply means the good news about Jesus. The good news is that Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection can change anyone’s life. Athens Church wants to see people, our community, and the world awakened to this reality. Perhaps this is why they are starting their first public church gathering on Easter Sunday, the day Christians celebrate Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead.
These are just a few reasons why I’m excited about Athens Church launching this Easter Sunday. My family and I will be attending this Sunday to support my friend and their church as they continue their church-planting journey.
If you would like to join us, Athens Church meets at Yes Cinema (328 Jackson Street) and their worship service starts at 10:30am. If you would like to learn more about Athens Church and my friend Aaron Lentz, check out their website here.

Introduction
The 2000’s have been to Greece what the 60’s were to Northwestern Europe. An era defined by strong growth & debt-financed consumption. Unsustainable. Doom to fail. We’ve all read that Greece suffered a huge blow from the economic crisis. But did know that Athens is also very much alive? With very little money, art and culture flourished in the capital. So much so that it attracted many artists from around the world, spawning a creative exodus in the country.
This dynamic was noticed by the artistic community and brought forth in the fourteenth edition of one of the world’s most ambitious contemporary art exhibitions: documenta. In 2017, for the first time in its history, the German quinquennial was split between Germany and Greece, between Kasse,l its main location, and Athens.
Over the course of 4 months, from exhibitions and events to encounters and friendships, we have permeated Athens’ artistic ecosystem to see this shift in dynamics and surge of creative energy. How to explain this dynamic? By understanding its causes.
From the social, political, economical, cultural and historical standpoints, this immersion has given us a certain picture of ​​Greece’s soul and identity. This creative effervescence cannot be understood without understanding Greece first.
Athens Artlife is a journey into the Greek soul of 2017 through its artistic scene.
Genesis /// Meeting a superstar
A chance, an evening, an encounter, a woman. Ingeborg Beugel. Dutch journalist, war reporter, a cigarette in one hand, glass of wine in the other, we discuss. A family friend, she tells us about Greece, the new life of Athens, the art scene, the influx of international artists, documenta.
She has some perspective. She’s been living in Greece for 30 years. She was married to the right-hand man of singer, actress and former Greek minister of culture Melina Mercouri. She knows the Athenian art scene. She is fascinating, we love her, she invites us to Athens to see for ourselves.
Fascinated by the thought that “less money means more art” we start our research. The New York Times, the BBC, the Guardian, le Monde, they all write about Athens and its new dynamics in arts and culture at large. Searching for a documentary on the subject, we cannot find one. The idea of ​making our own emerges. After 2 months of research, prep and the launch of the non-profit Odyssée Production, we fly to Athens in April 2017.
http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170509-can-athens-become-europes-new-arts-capital

In advance, our stupid mustachioed smile to thank your valuable help and support ❤
Arthur De Poortere & Alexandre Meeùs
NB. This crowdfunding’s only goal is to ensure that all the depth and beauty of this project can be highlighted and brought into focus in the editing stage so that this film can have the best chances of being recognized at its fair value, promoted widely and shown at festivals.
As all the footages have already been shot, the funds raised will go towards the costs of post-production (camera, editing, calibration), the cost of equipment (cameras, feet, lighting, microphones rented on site), to pay the various Greek aids (cameraman, film editors) and finally, for promotion and its festivals fees (registration costs).
Thanks for your implication, we will be able to get this film out there. You are an integral part of the project. Thanks thanks thanks!

When Athens Held a “Coolest Person” Contest (and the Loser Got Banished),https://medium.com/@funhistory/when-athens-held-a-coolest-person-contest-and-the-loser-got-banished-8552e8846526,"Sign up

Imagine living in a city where every year, the citizens gathered, not to elect their leaders, but to decide who was getting kicked out of town. Sounds like a reality TV show gone wrong? Actually, it was ancient Athenian democracy in action, around the 5th century BC. They called it ostracism, and it was their way of saying, “You know what, maybe you’re too popular for your own good.”
Let’s set the stage. Athens is buzzing. Democracy is the hot new political trend, philosophers are debating in the agora (marketplace), and everyone’s got an opinion — loudly voiced, of course. But with all this freedom and debate, there was a nagging fear: what if someone got too powerful? What if a charismatic leader charmed their way into tyranny, just like in the bad old days before democracy?
Enter ostracism. Think of it as a pressure release valve for Athenian society, a way to prevent any single person from becoming too influential and threatening the democratic balance. Every year, the Athenians would hold a vote. But instead of voting for someone, they voted against someone. Each citizen could write a name on a piece of pottery shard (an ostrakon, hence the name). If a name got enough votes — and “enough” was a hefty number, around 6,000 — that person was ostracized.
Now, here’s the kicker, the part that’s utterly hilarious from our modern perspective: ostracism wasn’t about punishing criminals or banishing enemies. It was about temporarily exiling people who were too successful, too well-liked, or simply too ambitious for the comfort of the democratic crowd. Imagine being so popular you get voted off the island… literally!
Picture the scene: The Athenian Assembly is packed. Citizens are nervously clutching their pottery shards. Whispers fill the air: “Is it Pericles this year? Maybe Cimon? He’s been awfully successful lately…” It’s like the ancient Greek version of the Met Gala red carpet, but instead of fashion critiques, careers are on the line.
And the punishment for being too awesome? Ten years of exile. That’s right, a decade-long timeout for being a bit too good at life. The ostracized individual had to pack their bags and leave Athens, although thankfully, they didn’t lose their property or citizenship. It was more of a “take a break, cool off, and maybe come back less… you.”
From our 21st-century perspective, this is comedy gold. A democratic society banishing people for being too popular? It’s like holding a “Most Likely to Succeed” contest in high school and then expelling the winner. We can almost imagine the ostracized Athenians grumbling as they packed their bags, “Seriously? I get punished for being good at things?”
But behind the humor, there’s a serious point. Ostracism, while seemingly absurd to us, reflects a deep-seated concern in ancient Athens about the dangers of unchecked power and the fragility of democracy. They were so committed to preventing tyranny that they were willing to temporarily sacrifice even their most capable citizens, just to be safe. It’s a drastic measure, born out of a very real fear.
Who was involved? The entire Athenian citizenry, from farmers to philosophers, participated in ostracism. Famous figures like Themistocles and Cimon were ostracized, proving that no one, no matter how accomplished, was immune to the public’s popularity anxieties. How did people react at the time? It was a regular part of Athenian political life, accepted, though probably not always happily, as a necessary safeguard for democracy.
This quirky practice from ancient Athens, while funny from our viewpoint, serves as a potent reminder of the constant balancing act between individual ambition and the collective good. It subtly underscores themes of resilience — the Athenians were constantly innovating to protect their democracy — and critical thinking: what are the potential downsides of even the most well-intentioned systems? And perhaps, it’s a cautionary tale about the fickle nature of popularity and the occasional human tendency to cut down the tallest poppies in the field.
So, next time you feel a pang of jealousy at someone else’s success, remember the ostracized Athenians. It could be worse — at least you’re not getting banished for being too awesome. And maybe, just maybe, it’s a good thing we don’t have popularity-based exile in our modern democracies. Although, thinking about some reality TV stars… just kidding! (mostly).

Travelling from Athens to Ohrid, Macedonia was probably one of the more adventurous backpacking experiences I had. I got on the road unplanned (and without mobile data) except booking a one-way train ticket from Athens to Thessaloniki. Then, I left the rest to the universe! The journey involved two train rides, a taxi ride, a police officer, and a car ride with a complete stranger (!) In this post, I am sharing the travel details of how I got to Ohrid from Athens. You can copy my route, but it might not be your cup of tea.
Pin it to read it later!
Why I wanted to visit Macedonia
The reason may sound funny to you. I heard the name of this small country in the news when I was 11 years old. My country Taiwan donated millions of dollars to Macedonia hoping to build a solid friendship, but all the money went into the pockets of corrupted Macedonian politicians (!) Well, I was 11, so none of the political matters was relevant to me. However, the name of Macedonia did get stuck in the back of my brain because it sounded like macadamia! (Yes, Macadamia, the nuts.)
Besides that, to be honest, I knew nothing about Macedonia except the capital Skopje was the birthplace of Mother Teresa. I wanted to go to Skopje from Athens but realised there wasn’t any direct trains/buses. I couldn’t arrive Macedonia without going through Thessaloniki! My Couchsurfing host in Athens suggested me to go to Ohrid first because it would be a pity to miss it. And I’ve never heard of Ohrid before that afternoon.
From Athens to Thessaloniki
I wanted to hitchhike at first, but my Macedonian host suggested me not to due to the rising crime in kidnapping/human trafficking (if I remember correctly.) I tried getting the train ticket in the morning of, but it was completely sold out, so I ended up travelling a day later. Taking the overnight train saved me a night of accommodation.
It was 2015, the year which thousands of Afghanistan, Syrian, and Iraqi refugees flooded into Europe through Macedonia. Many of them took the same train, and from their outfits and bags, it was quite clear that they weren’t going on a vacation. The train was noisy, packed, and the toilet was smelly, but I ain’t complaining because at least, I still had a seat and there was air conditioning.
I arrived Thessaloniki at dawn and was thinking to stay there for a day or two, but the exhaustion from the overnight ride got me. All I wanted to do was to charge my way to Ohrid. I followed the instruction my host in Athens gave me before I departed and asked the ticket booth for the next train to Florina.
From Thessaloniki to Florina was a smooth ride. The short distance local train was pretty empty in contrast to my last leg. My plan was to find a bus that would bring me to Ohrid, but of course, that idea fell through.
From Florina to Bitola, Macedonia
Florina is a small town at the border of Greece and Macedonia, and the train station was tiny, too. In fact, there wasn’t a “train station.” All I saw was a small blockhouse. I walked in there and asked who I assumed as the ticket agent about how to get to Ohrid, and here came the problem: He could barely understand English, and he has never heard of Ohrid before! At this point, I had already travelled for more than 10 hours.
I walked out and looked around but saw no one besides a taxi driver and a police officer. I walked up and asked about how to get to Ohrid by bus.
“You want to take the bus? It’s in the centre. Very far away,” the police officer said.
Great. I wondered how if there are any other ways I can get to Ohrid. He then exchanged a few words with the taxi driver.
“He can take you to Bitola, 14 euros.” That’s a pretty good deal, I thought to myself. How about Ohrid? I asked. “120 euros.” Hmm, that’s a drastic difference. I guess I’ll go to Bitola first, then figure out the rest.
I tried to make a conversation with the taxi driver, but he didn’t talk much English. When we were crossing the border, he took down his taxi sign and put it in his trunk. I supposed it’s illegal for him to operate as a cab driver in another country. It was miles of nothing on the way to Macedonia. When we finally made it to Bitola, I gave him 20 euros and waited for him to give me my change.
“One more.” He shook the bill I just gave him in his hand.
“Isn’t it fourteen euros?”
“Fourteen! Fourteen! Pen!” Then he took out a piece of paper and wrote: 40.
“Wait, I thought it was four-teen euros! Not for-ty! Can we do thirty instead?” I realised what went wrong here but proposed an alternative. He unwillingly agreed. I couldn’t help to feel bad, but I was on a budget. In the end, he did drive to another country and had to drive back.
From Bitola to Ohrid
There were a few buses parked at where the taxi driver dropped me off. An old man walked up to me and said he could drive me to Ohrid. I knew he wasn’t going to do it for free. I saw another blockhouse-looking building and wanted to see if it’s a ticket booth for the buses, but this one was worse than the one in Florina — It was abandoned with no one inside.
“How much?” I walked back to the old man. “20 euros.” “Okay, let’s go.” I got into his car.
His old stick-shift might be as ancient as him, and it was making squeaky sounds when we were driving. We were going 40km per hour on bumpy, curvy roads with Balkan music blasting through the almost broken radio. Again, I was trying to chat with him to keep myself awake, but that failed also. And there was no way for me to know how long the ride was supposed to take. The ride felt like forever! The man picked up a mid age woman on the road who waved him down when we were closer to Ohrid. It seemed like they knew each other.
Ohrid
After 12+ hours, I finally arrived Ohrid. I didn’t exchange any Macedonian Denars in Greece since I had no idea I would make it to Ohrid the day after. The old man waited for me outside of a currency exchange office and drove off after I gave him the equivalent of 20 euros in MKD. (I only had 100 euros, and he didn’t have any change in euros, of course.)
Where did I stay?
I arrived Ohrid at noon, and it was extremely hot! a few locals approached me and wanted me to stay at their hotels/B&B or whatever it was. I wondered around with my backpack in the city centre and found a hotel lobby that would let me use their free wifi. Then I found The Art Hostel Ohrid via Hostelworld. It was a bit far away from the city centre, but that was okay. I went without a reservation and got myself a bed! They didn’t ask me how many days I wanted to stay, and I received the warmest hospitality!
And that’s the story of how I travelled from Athens to Ohrid.
I travelled 802km and spent a total of 80 euros. It probably wasn’t the cheapest way, but it was an unforgettable experience. And Ohrid is definitely a hidden gem of the Balkans. I had the most pleasurable memories and met some wonderful people there. The town itself deserves its own post, so I’ll save the stunning photos of Ohrid in the next one!
If you like my travel stories, leave a comment and let me know! I would really appreciate that. Also, feel free to subscribe! and follow me on Facebook to stay up to date!

It was only 2 years ago in Athens Greece that the Cubans “barely” walked away with yet another gold medal after a great game with Australia. The seats were full…. and the field was rated the best that players had seen in Europe.
I wonder what happened to the facility? I have been told it is abandoned and scarcely used. Since I have not been back to Greece since the Olympics I have talked to a couple people that have said the stadium is off limits.
Thessaloniki is trying to build a new field. They are looking for donations. Go to www.baseballgreece.com
If Baseball is going to get back in the Olympics again we need to grow the game in Europe. That’s where the IOC members live that booted the game again last week out of the 2012 Olympics.
Time to sound off about Baseball Internationally. Its going to be a great year with the WBC. I will be working the field in San Juan at Hiram Bithorn Stadium for the World Baseball Classic. More to blog about that event.

2023, Athens, GreeceOn the occasion of the celebration of the great slaughter, there was an awakening of our reflexes to a ritual that takes place at regular intervals validating the rules of hierarchy of species where animals are inferior and are species to be exploited.
By striking at butchers we strike at the institutions and laws that wash away crimes but at the same time we highlight how the everyday person, the trader, the customer, etc. also participates in this timeless holocaust.
From this authoritarian mania, people from below do not escape by participating in customs or anti-customs calling themselves anti-authoritarians who contribute to the maintenance of the mass massacre by the domination. Being another proof that the state and power is primarily maintained by those who follow the rules, institutions and laws set by those from above and secondarily by the state and power.
For these reasons we chose as a minimal act of retaliation to strike shops and warehouses of dismembered corpses, conceived as food, because of sadistic anthropocentric culture. We chose to sabotage with simple means such as paint, glue, and leaflets by promoting it to every person who espouses the idea of anti-slavery to act accordingly in the spaces where they move.
Breaking down in practice the structures of control, discipline, and self-monitoring. We propose mass sabotage because anarchy without direct action is incomplete.
Authoritarians of all forms will find us before you.
