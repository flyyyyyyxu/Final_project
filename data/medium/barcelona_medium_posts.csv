This was meant to be the grand finale. Our last trip together in Europe before we all parted ways. What began as a plan for three (ZNMD lite version) eventually became two — just me and a friend who, by now, felt like family. We had traveled together across cities, through subways and sunsets, navigating hostels, meals, and moods.
Barcelona was supposed to be the reward. A final stretch of warmth, beaches, and Gaudí. But as life often does, it threw a few surprises in the mix. From minor illnesses to delayed flights, this trip tested our patience — and also our ability to find joy in imperfect moments.
This wasn’t a flawless trip. But maybe that’s why it became so real.
(December 26 | Evening)
We landed in Barcelona around 6 PM, coming in from Milan. The sun was already dipping low, casting a golden hue across the city. After navigating the metro and dropping our bags at our hostel near Plaça de Catalunya, we stepped out for our first real look at the city.
Dinner that night wasn’t fancy — just burgers and fries at a modest spot in the Gothic Quarter, about a 15-minute walk from where we were staying. It was chilly but not unbearable. The Dr. Pepper we tried? Absolutely awful. We laughed about it for days.
The Gothic Quarter was beautiful — winding cobbled streets, glowing street lamps, and a quiet hum in the air. The charm of Barcelona was already there, even in that quiet, uneventful evening. We called it an early night. We had plans for the next day — the big tourist circuit.
(December 27 | Morning to Night)
We started our day around 8:30 AM with a quick breakfast at the hostel — basic croissants, coffee, and juice. Simple, but comforting. Our first destination: the legendary Sagrada Família (144 Years and still in the making !).
We reached around 9:30 AM, and even from the outside, it was majestic. We skipped the ticketed tour — part budget, part burnout from visiting so many historical monuments — but admired the architectural madness of Gaudí from outside. It’s one of those buildings that looks like it was made from dreams and clay.
After that, we strolled down La Rambla. It was late morning, and the boulevard was buzzing — street artists, souvenir stalls, flower vendors, and tourists taking it all in. We didn’t linger too long, just enough to feel the pulse of the city.
By noon, we were heading toward Montjuïc Hill, one of the most peaceful, scenic places I’ve visited in Europe. A short metro ride, a funicular, and then a walk — nearly 3 km uphill. The climb was tiring, but the views? Absolutely worth it.
We sat at the top for over an hour, saying little, just taking in the full panorama of Barcelona, the coastline, and the city’s never-ending sprawl. I plugged in my headphones. My friend wandered nearby. That silence — it was its own kind of conversation.
And then — a moment I’ll never forget.
Right there, under that open sky, my friend got a message — his name had been shortlisted for a company he had dreamt of, one of those rare ones you really wish for from the heart. I could see it on his face — the mix of disbelief, joy, relief. Strangely, as he stood there beaming, I felt like I had won something too. It’s hard to explain, but sometimes, feeling genuinely happy for someone else fills you up in a way no personal win can. Maybe that’s what made Montjuïc so unforgettable for me.
Lunch followed at Park Güell, around 2:30 PM. We grabbed pizza and soaked in the colorful mosaics, the tourist chatter, the open sky. We didn’t buy entry to the paid area but wandered around the outer gardens and terraces.
By 4:30 PM, we were at Casa Batlló — another Gaudí masterpiece. We admired it from the outside, took photos, joked about how everything in Barcelona looks like it was part of a fairytale. Then, we made our way to Barceloneta Beach.
It was close to sunset by the time we reached. The beach was quieter than expected. We sat on the sand, letting the cold sea breeze hit our faces. It was one of the most peaceful parts of the trip — just us, the sea, and the last golden light of the day.
Dinner was at an Indian restaurant nearby. Chicken biryani, roti, and aloo sabzi. After days of European food, this meal tasted like home.
We got back to the hostel by 9 PM, exhausted but satisfied.
(December 28 | All Day)
That morning, I woke up feeling… off. Slight fever, sore throat — the travel exhaustion catching up. We still had our hostel breakfast around 8:30 AM, took it slow, and adjusted our plans.
Since Montjuïc had felt like our favorite place so far, we decided to return. But first, a few morning hours spent walking around El Born and La Ribera, exploring quaint alleys and artisan shops. No real plan, just letting the city guide us.
We made it back to Montjuïc Hill by noon, took the same uphill walk, but this time more slowly. The sky was clearer than the previous day. I felt tired, but the view from the top had the same calming effect. We sat again for an hour or so, recharging under the open sky.
In the afternoon, we went looking for churros, a Barcelona must-try. But the place we picked? Big mistake. The churros were soggy and full of oil — almost inedible. We laughed, then coughed from the oil. Another memory added.
We spent the rest of the day walking slowly through the city, visiting spots like Poble Espanyol and some public gardens. I wasn’t feeling great, so we skipped anything too ambitious.
By 6 PM, we headed back to our hostel to rest and pack.
The chaos wasn’t over though. At the airport, our flight got delayed by three hours. And then, the worst part: at security, I was asked to empty my water bottle. With no trash bins nearby and an unreasonably long bathroom line, I had to drink 1.5 liters of water in one go.
That moment, standing with a full stomach of water, waiting for boarding, perfectly captured the kind of randomness this trip brought us.
I didn’t expect Barcelona to be like this. I expected a picture-perfect finale. But what I got was something better — realness. From the bad churros to the second visit to Montjuïc, this trip was a reminder that travel doesn’t have to be perfect to be meaningful.
There’s a strange peace that comes from letting go of expectations. Not every moment needs to be “Instagram-worthy.” Sometimes, it’s enough to just be — sit by the sea, walk up a hill twice, laugh over bad soda, and eat overpriced biryani that warms your soul anyway.
This wasn’t the cleanest or most exciting trip I’ve taken. But in its messiness, it felt… honest.
And as we boarded our final flight out of Spain, I realized — you don’t always need magic to make memories. Sometimes, the quiet ones stick the longest.

After a short two-hour flight from Sevilla, I landed in El Prat. The airport itself was modern, giant, and filled with many shops. This was a small introduction to the mix of commerce and culture that defines Barcelona. Barcelona is a city that has been described to me as the “New York of Spain” due to its fast-paced energy, international presence, and never-ending movement. Unlike the more traditional Andalusian cities, Barcelona felt like a place where the past and the future collided, a city of contrasts where Gothic cathedrals stood beside modernist architecture.
From the moment we arrived, it was clear that Barcelona had a different energy from other Spanish cities I had visited. It was sprawling and filled with people who seemed to be going somewhere, whether to work, a café, or just out to wander the streets.
That evening, a lovely Friday, we set out to explore the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), the historic core of Barcelona. Walking through its maze-like streets felt old, like stepping back in time. Once the site of the Roman city Barcino, the area has evolved over the centuries, yet its medieval architecture still remains. Narrow alleyways open into small plazas, and at night, the whole place has a completely different feel.
We stopped for dinner at Machete, a small but lively spot where $1 tacos on Tuesdays draw in a mix of locals and students. The nachos were a standout, and it was a great place to meet up with a group, as my friend introduced me to others studying abroad in Barcelona.
After dinner, we made our way to Monk, a speakeasy that at first glance looks like a convenience store. From the outside, it’s brightly lit with shelves stocked with snacks, but behind the counter, a door opens to reveal a vibrant, stone-walled bar. Deeper inside, a mirrored tunnel leads to another hidden space with a louder, more club-like atmosphere. It was one of those places you’d never find unless someone told you about it, a theme that repeated itself throughout the trip.
The next morning, we started with brunch at Zenith, a popular spot with a rooftop terrace and a solid menu of classic breakfast dishes. It’s a place that fills up quickly, so reservations are a good idea. I stuck to my usual, eggs Benedict and chai, before we headed out to explore more of the city.
Our next stop was Casa Batlló and Casa Milà (La Pedrera), two of Antoni Gaudí’s most famous works.
Casa Batlló is often called the “House of Bones” due to its skeletal-like design. The undulating facade, colorful mosaics, and lack of straight lines make it one of the most distinctive buildings in Barcelona.
Casa Milà (La Pedrera) is another example of Gaudí’s unconventional approach, with its wave-like stone exterior.
Both buildings are stunning, but visiting them comes at a price not just in terms of admission fees, which are high, but also in time, as lines can be long. We opted to admire them from the outside rather than go in.
From there, we walked to Parc de la Ciutadella, one of the city’s largest green spaces. Once a military fortress, it was transformed into a public park in the late 19th century. The Cascada Monumental, a grand fountain partially designed by a young Gaudí, is the highlight. The park was full of people lounging, playing music, or rowing small boats on the lake, a good place to slow down in a city that doesn’t seem to stop moving.
That evening, we had dinner at Robata, a Japanese restaurant known for its sushi. It was one of the best meals I’d had in Europe. Fresh fish and good flavors, but the price reflected the quality. It was worth it for a splurge meal.
To end the night, we went to Razzmatazz, a massive seven-story club with different music on each floor. It was packed, chaotic, and exactly what you’d expect from a city known for its nightlife.
The next morning, we took it slow, starting the day with a quick dip in the Mediterranean. The water was cold, but the sun made it worth it. Even though it wasn’t peak beach season, spending time by the coast was a nice contrast to the city’s nonstop buzz.
After warming up with a walk, we made our way to Sagrada Família, Gaudí’s most famous project. Construction started in 1882, and more than 140 years later, it’s still unfinished. The goal is to complete it by 2030, but even that isn’t guaranteed.
Antoni Gaudí is one of the most important figures in Barcelona’s identity. His architecture is everywhere, colorful, organic, and heavily tied to nature and Catalan culture. Instead of following the straight lines and flat surfaces that were typical at the time, Gaudí pulled inspiration from the natural world, plants, animals, flowing shapes, and from his strong Catholic faith. His work helped shape the look and spirit of Barcelona.
Sagrada Família is different from some of his other, more playful buildings, like Casa Batlló or Park Güell. It feels heavier and more serious. The facades are covered in detailed carvings that tell the story of Jesus’s life, and every part of it is full of symbolism.
We didn’t go inside, but even seeing it from the outside was enough to get a sense of the scale and ambition behind it. It’s one thing to hear about it being unfinished, it’s another to stand underneath it and realize just how massive and detailed it actually is. Even in a city full of unique architecture, Sagrada Família stands in a category of its own.
For our final dinner, we chose Clorofila, a small, local restaurant where we ordered tapas, including “the bomb”, a croquette-like dish, and a fresh tuna tartare. It was a simple but well-executed meal, a nice change from the more tourist-heavy spots.
Later that night, we went to Opium, another club, where we met many friends. One thing about Barcelona’s nightlife is you’ll always meet new people. Before we knew it, it was 7:30 AM.
With no sleep, we packed our bags and headed straight to the airport, running on adrenaline and caffeine. It was a rough morning.
Barcelona is a city that thrives on movement. Whether you’re walking through its historic streets, admiring Gaudí’s architectural wonders, or diving into its nightlife, there’s a constant sense of energy.
It’s not a place for quiet retreats, there’s little in the way of natural escapes, and the pace can be overwhelming, but for a short trip, it’s packed with things to see and do. The food, the history, the nightlife, the beach, it all comes together to make Barcelona.

Astonishing architecture, bustling streets, and a cathedral under construction for over 132 years!
Stepping out of the airport shuttle, onto the busy sidewalk in front of our hotel, my eye is immediately drawn skyward.
I’m surrounded by impressive buildings, their stone facades reaching hundreds of feet high.
The street is teeming with cars, buses, bikes and pedestrians.
Barcelona is the first stop of our twelve day cruise around the Mediterranean Sea. It’s the embarkation point.
Tomorrow evening, our ship will sail at 5 PM.
We have the next twenty-four hours to explore this popular Spanish city.
The older members of our family decide to take an afternoon nap.
The overnight flight was long, and sleep was lacking. They’re tired.
My husband and I decide to use the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus to see the city sights.
This is an easy way to take a quick tour, complete with headphones, and an audio recording about the sights we’ll see.

Barcelona is a bucket list must-visit destination for thousands and thousands of Americans. Many long to marvel at the majesty of La Sagrada Familia, leisurely stroll down La Ramba, spend time at Park Güell, and, of course, dine on tapas in a noisy bar. This fabulous city has been my home for a bit over four years since I quietly snuck in during the height of the pandemic in September 2020. For me, it’s been a paradise. But is Barcelona for everyone? I think a certain American demographic should probably steer clear of this gem of the Mediterranean. To understand why, you’ll first have to have a short history lesson.
Barcelona resisted Franco’s authoritarian rule during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In July 1936, when Franco’s coup began, blue-collar workers banded together with the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (anarchists), Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista (Marxists), and Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (socialists). Despite severe infighting, these three groups, known as the Popular Front, were a powerhouse in the anti-Franco movement. Unfortunately, Barcelona was captured in 1939, and Franco’s reign as a fascist…

Random tips, thoughts and insights to prepare for your trip to the Catalan Coast.
Around this time last year, I decided to leave the US on a semi-permanent basis and travel the world. The logic was simple, almost anywhere else has a lower cost of living than the States right now, so why not jump on a plane and explore the world while trying to survive in, well, *gestures vaguely all over* this. Since my decision to travel overseas for an undetermined time, like many of my life-changing choices, was made on a whim, I sacrificed several things while preparing for the first leg in Barcelona… like doing any research or recognizance on the city AT ALL. I literally just googled beach towns in Spain, cracked open my laptop to search for the best lodging deals and that was IT.
Well, when all was said and done, I loved my time in the city. However, there were definitely some things I hadn’t expected (or even thought to consider) while I was there. Additionally, it took me almost a month to decompress and come out of the dense fog of burnout that decades of chasing the “American Dream” caused, so I did not explore the city as much as I probably would have under different circumstances.
Regardless, if you’re planning a trip to Barcelona, here are a few things to think about before you go!
Day-to-Day Culture: Barcelona is slllooowww… They’ve mastered work/life balance. I mean, the Starbucks near me didn’t even open until 9 AM! While some people work earlier, life really doesn’t get active until after 11 AM, especially in retail areas. And as for an afternoon siesta? They take their midday breaks SERIOUSLY, with many stores, restaurants, and offices closing for a few hours every afternoon.
Dinner is also late for most Americans, typically starting no earlier than 8 PM. Long story short, prepare for late mornings and even later nights. On this same note, meals are a communal experience, with the culture celebrating sharing good food, conversation, and alcohol with friends and family, especially around dinner time.
Museums: Given the long and rich history of the city, there are museums and historical attractions galore, but with my limited time touristing, I focused on the museums that were within walking distance of my rental. A must-see is obviously the Picasso Museum, home to one of the most extensive collections of Pablo’s early works, offering insight into his formative years and deep connection to the beautiful city. Contemporary and street art enthusiasts (like myself) will appreciate MoCo Museum, which showcases cutting-edge modern artists, including Banksy, Basquiat (my absolute FAVE), and Warhol. For a more immersive experience of Banksy himself, the Banksy Museum (another fave of mine, as well as my son’s) highlights the elusive artist’s most iconic works, bringing his provocative messages to life through several styles of exhibits. Whether you’re drawn to classic masterpieces, bold contemporary statements, or just want some cool souvenirs and gifts, Barcelona’s museums have something for everyone.
Trash & Recycle: Recycling is big in Barcelona, and there are public disposal bins on almost every street (green = glass, blue = paper, yellow = plastic), so there’s really no reason not to participate. Public trash cans are on almost every corner as well. Cleaning your table after you eat, however, even at a fast food joint, is apparently not a thing.
Smoking: If you’re not a smoker, don’t be offended by the amount of people that do partake in Barcelona. It’s tolerated, accepted, and in some ways, still romanticized.
Pets & People: Leashes are just a suggestion. On that note, I only saw a few stray animals during my time in Barcelona, something that, having lived in big cities all over the world, quite surprised me. Stray people, however, were much more common.
Take advantage of the produce! It’s cheaper, bigger, fresher, juicier, and lasts much longer than anything sold in the States. Like, the grapes alone were the same size as my air pods case (insert Mind Blown emoji here).
Actually, the food in Barcelona is just better in every way: quality, taste, and overall experience. Because of the EU’s food regulations and just cultural differences in general, several of the chemicals, preservatives, and additives that have become staples in the ultra-processed American Diet are illegal in countries like Spain. Instead, they focus on whole foods and simple preparation and preservation techniques. This single change resulted in me losing over eight pounds during my time there, without even trying, simply because of the food quality and options.
Finally, and super random, but if you know me, you know I loooovveee boba. Well, believe it or not, cream cheese is a common option to top off your boba in Barcelona. If you’re anything like me and DON’T like cream cheese… BEWARE!
Public bathrooms were the biggest issue for me in Barcelona. While I don’t want to make a blanket statement and say all bathrooms in Barcelona are no bueno, of the public restrooms I visited, the majority had long lines, were not clean and often lacked toilet paper (especially at Starbucks). It was also more common than not for toilet paper to be thrown in the garbage can instead of flushed down the toilet. And while I know this is common in many countries, as a spoiled American, it’s just not my favorite practice.
No matter your exercise preference or routine, Barcelona has gyms, clubs, and classes for any need.
Now that I’m finally consistent, one must for any city I travel to is regular access to a gym, and let me tell you, there is no shortage of them in Barcelona. Since I was only in the city for two months, I didn’t want to sign a contract or put my card on file, which limited my options. However, Reboot Bruc, a small, boutique gym with just the right amount of equipment and variety, came through for the win. At just under $100 a month, it was well worth the money and only a 2.2 km walk from my condo.
Nutrition/Supplement stores are also scattered throughout the city, making it easy to find any protein powders, pre-workouts, or supplements you may need. Located right around the corner from Reboot, Active Nutrition Barcelona became my go-to shop, both for the selection and the niceness of the staff and owner. 10/10 Highly Recommend :D
Barcelona is most definitely a city for pedestrians. In fact, during my time there I walked EVERYWHERE, except to and from the airport. The cobblestone streets are narrow and serve as sidewalks first, and roads second, especially in heavily populated and frequented areas like The Gothic Quarter, el Born, and Barceloneta Beach. The city is also a prime example of how great public transportation can be, with taxis, Uber, bikes, scooters, buses, trains, and even boats, readily available and easily accessible from almost anywhere in the city.
No matter where you go in Barcelona you’re going to have a plethora of food choices. From every world cuisine to vegetarian and vegan options to desserts you didn’t even know existed, there truly isn’t a lack of anything in Barcelona. My faves include:
Honest Greens: A haven for healthy, organic, and ethically sourced meals, Honest Greens offers a vibrant atmosphere complemented by hip-hop beats and a strong sense of community. With multiple locations across Barcelona, my favorite is in El Born. The menu boasts a wide variety of dishes made with fresh ingredients, catering to diverse dietary preferences. It’s a popular spot, so be prepared for a lively, bustling environment and a potentially long wait for a table during peak hours.
Lady Dumpling: This cozy eatery specializes in fresh, handmade dumplings (like you can literally watch them make and stuff the little envelopes of pleasure in the front window as you enter), offering a delightful range of flavors and ingredients to satisfy any craving or dietary need. With multiple locations, it’s a convenient stop for a quick bite. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making it a great place to refuel before resuming your exploration of the city. The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they sell their sauces in bulk form, should you (ie: me) want to take a taste of the awesomesauce home with you.
Rangoli: As a self-proclaimed aficionado of Indian cuisine, discovering Rangoli in Barcelona at the end of my trip was a delightful surprise. Located at the outer edge of Barceloneta Beach, this restaurant offers an extensive menu of authentic Indian dishes, each bursting with rich flavors and spices. The ambiance is elegant and the service is attentive, making it a perfect spot for both casual dinners and special occasions.
Vegan Junk Food Bar: This vibrant spot combines a lively atmosphere with an innovative plant-based menu. Known for its colorful and indulgent dishes, including pink burger buns and faux-cheese-loaded spicy fries, it’s a haven for vegans and non-vegans alike. The creative cocktails and energetic vibe make it a must-visit destination for those seeking a fun, unique and Instagram-worthy dining experience.
Should you, like me, enjoy galavanting around the world without the trappings of other people’s decision-making, or lack thereof, then Barcelona is a GREAT option to explore solo dolo. That being said, however, it’s not without its shortcomings. Now, I don’t want to paint a negative picture of the city and culture as a whole, because in general, Barcelona is peaceful, beautiful and pretty much safe. However, in the spirit of full transparency, I ran into two major issues while there:
Welp, that’s a wrap on Barcelona! As I am traveling all over the world, this will be a series highlighting the shit you probably haven’t thought of, but should know in all the locations I’ve spent extended time in. Up Next: Pyeontaek, South Korea. :D

I relocated to this fabulous city from New York in September 2020. I did so during the pandemic and while the borders were closed. It wasn’t easy, but I found some gray areas in the rules that allowed me to enter. I planned to stay in Barcelona for three months. I never left. I’m still here.
I am certainly not an expert in all things Barcelona. I’ve never worked as a tour guide and barely speak Spanish. I only know a few words in Catalán, the official language of Catalonia, the autonomous community in which Barcelona resides. What I do have is first-hand experience living here.
If you’re visiting Barcelona for the first time, I believe I can help you have a much better experience. This article isn’t exactly a travel guide; it’s more of a summary of what to do, see, and expect. ¡Venga, vamos!
Much like any big city anywhere on the planet, Barcelona does have its fair share of crime. However, tourists have very little to worry about when visiting. This city does have a reputation for pickpocketing and petty theft, but so do Paris and Rome. In my opinion, it’s safer here than in most popular tourist destinations around the world.

During one of my UK visits, I had a wonderful time visiting Barcelona on a three-day trip, with my daughter. She had to attend a medical conference in Barcelona, and she decided to take me along so that I could also see the place.
The first day my daughter attended the medical conference and presented her paper. In the evening, we both visited some nearby places where we had our accommodation.
The second day we decided to go on a tour to see the places. Barcelona is packed with historical buildings, parks, museums, beaches and shopping centres. Barcelona is also known for its vibrant street life and lively atmosphere.
Like many others, we too used a ‘hop-on-hop-off’ bus for sightseeing.
Sagrada Familia is one of the top attractions of Barcelona. It is one of Antonio…

In May, my wife and I embarked on a long-awaited trip to the captivating city of Barcelona. Leaving behind the lackluster Stansted Airport, the excellent Barcelona Airport greeted us, setting the tone for an unforgettable cultural trip. This blog post isn’t a list of things to see as many travel articles are but our feelings and responses to the vibrant atmosphere and rich cultural tapestry that is Barcelona.
We had booked a city center hotel. As we arrived late, we caught a taxi to our hotel. We engaged the driver in conversation as we often do in our travels. He responded warmly to our questions, although a little reluctantly at first because he felt his English wasn’t good enough. It was good enough for us, so we persisted. He wasn’t a Barcelonian, he came from southern Spain, but had made his home here. That’s got to mean something.
Once the driver was comfortable with us he peppered our journey with stories and things to see as we progressed into the city, such as the university, the bull ring that they had converted into a shopping mall, La Rambla, the Plaça Catalunya, and Gaudí’s Casa Batlló. Finally, we got to our hotel which was just off the impressive Passeig de Gràcia with its grand shops. (Note: Passeig is a Catalan word, not Spanish, it means Passage or avenue.) His parting words to us was to eat in the nearby street, it is very famous he said in his broken English, although better than my non-existent Spanish or Catalan.
Our driver was right. After a warm welcome at the hotel we walked right round the corner into Rambla de Catalunya, a street lined with restaurants and bars, and down the tree lined center with “alfresco” seating and tables for the restaurants. These areas were buzzing with people, chatting and laughing while they enjoyed their meal, or just drinks.
No exploration of Barcelona would be complete without indulging in its culinary treasures. We ate in the hotel most mornings and a couple of nights. However, mostly we ate in the restaurants of Rambla de Catalunya, sampling the delicious tapas, paella, and sangria that the city is renowned for. During the days we roamed around Barcelona and embarked on a culinary adventure, stepping away from the touristy hotspots. We discovered hidden gems in the lesser-known neighborhoods, going through medieval alleyways where we savored authentic Catalan dishes bursting with local flavors or the authentic Indian restaurant recommended by the hotel staff. The blend of traditional, contemporary and exotic cuisine in Barcelona is a testament to the city’s gastronomic prowess.
Upon stepping foot in Barcelona, we immediately noticed the city’s lively atmosphere, the bustling streets, filled with locals and tourists alike, brimmed with an energy that was infectious. Wandering through the enchanting Gothic Quarter, we found ourselves captivated by the charming narrow alleyways and hidden squares. We found the medieval cathedral, the roman temple of Augustus, the medieval palace, the Basilica de la Mare (for those that saw the TV series), and George Orwell square. Reminding me of Orwell’s contribution to the Spanish Civil War and his memoir’s an homage to Catalonia. With each corner turned, we stumbled upon some new scene, curiosity or event, all adding to the unique rhythm of the city. We wandered into a pharmacy on the second day and talked to the owner for about an hour. He sold many herbal remedies including dope. We bought nothing but had an enchanting time. His family had been in the same shop for over 120 years.
To truly understand the soul of Barcelona, we immersed ourselves in its rich cultural traditions. Barcelona’s passion for art was clear in every corner, with its many galleries and street art scene providing a canvas for artistic expression. I was sad that I could not attend the Flamenco festival, which was held in March, but our hotel had recommended a venue on La Rambla with Flamenco performances, I wrote about this a week or two ago. We had an excellent night.
Barcelona is the heart of Catalonia, a region with a distinct culture and language. Engaging with the locals allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the Catalonian identity. Conversations in small cafes and bars revealed the pride they held for their heritage and their ongoing pursuit of autonomy. Visiting the stunning architectural wonders of Antoni Gaudí, such as the iconic Sagrada Família and Park Güell, further reinforced the unique blend of art, history, and cultural identity that defines Barcelona, but funnily we were not driven to go into any of these. We found that just wandering the streets and exploring were a joy.
Barcelona’s prime location on the Mediterranean coast provides a perfect balance between vibrant city life and relaxing beach escapes. We soaked up the Mediterranean spirit by strolling along the picturesque seaside promenade, taking in the salty sea breeze and basking in the warm sun.
Our trip to Barcelona proved to be an enriching experience beyond our expectations. We did not see all the usual tourist attractions; but the city’s vibrant atmosphere, rich cultural traditions, and the friendliness and unwavering pride of its people captivated us. Barcelona left an indelible mark on our hearts. To describe Barcelona in a single word I would say color. But it has so much more, it’s filled with love and friendships. History is remembered, and the future embraced. The final take away: A week just wasn’t enough, you get a flavor of Barcelona but to do it justice you need much longer to savor Barcelona.

“Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.” — Anita Desai
Before moving to Barcelona, I thought I knew what to expect. I had mentally prepared myself for the late dinners and the siestas, researched culture in Spain and even used Duolingo to try to start learning the language (RIP Duo).
But no amount of research or prep could have fully prepared me for the reality of living here — where waiting for the walk sign is a sacred ritual, iced coffee is nearly nonexistent and people treat Mondays like a Saturday night.
Some of these things threw me off at first. Some still do. But every single one has taught me something about how people live here, and how different that is from life back home.
I grew up near New York City, where the rule of the streets is simple: if there’s no car coming, you walk. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve almost walked straight into traffic here, expecting others to follow, only to realize that I am the only one walking.
In Barcelona, people actually wait. Even when there’s no car in sight, even when the road is clear, they stand there, patiently, as if jaywalking isn’t a core part of urban culture. I respect it. I also physically cannot do it. It’s a habit too ingrained in me, and I’m sure the locals watch me cross on a red light and think, Ah yes, the American.
In the U.S., dinner at 6 or 7 PM is normal. In Barcelona? That’s mid-afternoon. Restaurants don’t even open for dinner until at least 8 PM, and most people don’t sit down to eat until 9 or 10.
But it’s not just the timing, it’s the pace. If you’re used to American-style service, where waiters check in every five minutes and bring the bill before you even ask, Barcelona will test your patience. Here, meals are slow, on purpose. No one is rushing to turn tables or push you out the door. You sit, you talk, you enjoy and when you’re ready, you wave the waiter down for the check.
At first, as a waiter myself, I found myself getting impatient. Why is no one bringing water? Where is the bill? But the more I’ve eaten here, the more I’ve realized — this is the point. Meals aren’t just about eating, they’re about being present. People take their time. They actually enjoy their food. They’re not speed-running dinner just to get to the next thing.
And maybe that’s something I should be learning from, instead of resisting.
I used to be a proud, iced coffee-dependent American. Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts were my second homes. The idea of drinking hot coffee in warm weather made no sense to me. And yet, here I am, ordering espressos like I’ve been doing it my whole life.
Something about sipping a tiny, strong coffee at a café instead of carrying around a massive iced latte just feels… right. I have accepted that iced coffee is a rarity here, and in return, I have gained an appreciation for sitting down, enjoying my coffee and pretending to be effortlessly European.
In the U.S., tipping is mandatory. In Spain? It’s almost nonexistent. You round up the bill maybe, but no one is expecting 20% for handing you a drink. As a waiter myself, this was one of the hardest things to adjust to.
The first few times I paid for a meal, I felt like a criminal. I wanted to leave something, anything, just to ease the guilt. But the more time I’ve spent here, the more I’ve realized that tipping isn’t part of the culture because wages are livable. People aren’t relying on tips to survive, and that is how it should be.
If it’s 60 degrees Fahrenheit in Syracuse, people are in shorts. In Barcelona, people are in scarves, boots and full winter coats.
Every time I step outside in a light sweater, I feel like there is a giant glowing sign above my head flashing “NOT A LOCAL.” I can practically hear the crowd chanting imposter! at me. Meanwhile, I am sweating.
It’s a small thing, but it’s made me realize just how much weather perception is cultural. In Barcelona, this is winter. In upstate New York? This is beach weather. I fear I may never feel cold again.
There are two kinds of people in Barcelona:
Seriously. Every time I walk through the city, I see people just relaxing. Having long lunches, chatting with friends, sipping drinks in the middle of the day. Meanwhile, in the U.S., hustle culture has everyone eating desk lunches and answering emails at 11 PM.
It’s made me think about work-life balance in a way I never have before. Here, people take their time. They enjoy their food, they enjoy their conversations, they enjoy their lives.
Honestly though? I think I might be a little too addicted to being busy to know how to slow down the way people do here.
In Spain, weekends are a suggestion. People go out on Mondays. And Wednesdays. Until 6 AM.
I do not understand this lifestyle. I have 9 AM Spanish class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which means going out until sunrise on a Monday is not an option. And yet, half my class doesn’t show up the next morning.
It’s not just the late nights, it’s the fact that people seem completely unfazed by them. I’ll overhear someone casually mention getting home at 7 AM, only to see them out again the next night like it’s nothing. How do they do it? I need answers.
A latte and a croissant for 4 euros. A full meal for less than $10.
I don’t know how I’m supposed to return to the U.S. and pay $15 for a mediocre sandwich after this. Every time I buy groceries here, I stare at the total like this can’t be right. The clothing stores are just as bad (or good, depending on your self-control). It’s like Spain wants me to spend every dime I own.
I fear I may never financially recover from this city.
The other day, it was raining, and my shopping bag broke in the middle of the street.
If this had happened in New York, people might have just stepped over my stuff, angry that I was in the way. Maybe someone would’ve even taken something.
But in Barcelona? People ran over to help. They held umbrellas over me, picked up my things, made sure I was okay. It caught me off guard. It made me rethink how I view strangers, how I interact with people, how small moments of kindness can completely change someone’s day.
Small plates of food that you can order endlessly, at any time of day? Why has the U.S. not adopted this?
Someone, please, bring tapas to America. I need them.
I came here expecting to adapt to a new culture. What I didn’t expect was how much it would make me rethink my own.
Barcelona has shown me that life doesn’t have to be rushed. That time spent lingering over a meal isn’t wasted. That work shouldn’t come at the cost of actually living. That strangers can be unexpectedly kind. That I can survive without iced coffee — although I will never stop missing it.
But more than anything, Barcelona has shown me what it means for a city to have life. To be filled with people who embrace every moment, whether it’s a long afternoon at a café, a heated fútbol match in a packed bar (thank you George Paynes) or a random band playing music on the streets of the Gothic Quarter or in the metro. There’s a constant energy here, a rhythm that never really stops and somehow, I’ve fallen right into it.
Eventually, I’ll leave this city. I’ll go back to routines that once felt normal. But something about the way I see things has changed, and I don’t think I can unlearn it. I think I’m missing Barcelona before I’ve even left.
Because once you’ve lived in a city that like this, that feels this alive, how am I supposed to go back to anything less?

How I Met Your Mother was one of my favourite shows growing up. Watching endless reruns became such a ritual that I could effortlessly complete the dialogues. In the show, New York becomes more than just a setting — it’s a character itself. Ted Mosby, the passionate architect lead, faces a tough decision to relocate to Chicago for his career. The struggle is real as he’s deeply attached to the city. But when he decides to do so, he goes to the Empire State Building and shares his feelings on how he “hates the thought of leaving Empy”.
When I watched this as a 14 year old, I delve deep into architecture as a concept and discover why Chicago and New York are renowned for their distinctive and influential architecture.
To bid farewell to 2023, I embarked on a trip to Europe, and Barcelona emerged as one of my final destinations. When Barcelona comes to mind, I think of a vivid mix of FC Barcelona, the iconic Camp Nou, Flamenco, the tapas and the beaches. Once I got to Barcelona, it hit me that the standout feature was the incredible architecture. And at the heart of it all was the work of the Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudí.
Antoni Gaudí is known for a variety of architectural creations, ranging from parks to basilicas. The first of his marvels that I explored was La Sagrada Familia, an unfinished basilica that began construction in 1882. It’s a UNESCO world heritage site despite still being a work in progress.
The first thing that struck me about this place was that there was not a single square feet left blank on the walls of the church. At this point in my Europe journey, I had seen a ton of churches that imbibe Gothic features, but this felt incredibly rich in character and detail. I could not immediately point out what it was, but thoroughly enjoyed exploring this spectacular place on a sunny Barcelona day.
The next day, I headed to Park Güell, a cool hilltop park. It’s a UNESCO world heritage site as well, and you don’t need a detective to figure out Gaudí was behind it. Something about his style stood out again — those mosaic walls and uniquely detailed, uneven shapes. Though these are part of his signature, I sensed I was still overlooking a crucial aspect.
Next on my agenda was a visit to two of his famous buildings on the same street — Casa Batlló and Casa Milà. As I saw a sea of people outside these buildings, I realised how Gaudi is deeply engrained into Catalan culture. These 2 buildings gave away the last and the most important trait that I was missing out on. A signature Antoni Gaudi building is not just extremely well detailed with figurines and mosaic tiles, but the beauty is that none of them have straight lines or sharp corners!
The more you inspect, the more unbelievable it is that he pulled it off. Buildings with no sharp corners or straight lines, be it on the corner of a street or one of the world’s largest churches, those classic (scaleable!) Gaudí traits just ooze out. I dug up the internet to know more about why he did what he did, and found out that Gaudi often said:
I do not want to create straight lines and sharp corners because they do not exist in nature. Nature is all curves, organic shapes, and flowing lines. My architecture is a reflection of the natural world, an attempt to capture its beauty and harmony.
While I had a great time visiting Barcelona, the only 2 things that will make me want to go back are: To watch an FC Barcelona game in Camp Nou, and to revisit the Sagrada Familia once it’s complete, which is estimated to be sometime in 2030. Until then, I can only wonder what he must’ve been sketching on his notepad here.
Happy new year, and thank you for reading!

I moved to Barcelona in September 2020, during the height of the pandemic. Although the world frowned upon travel at this time and many countries had locked down their borders, I quietly snuck in through Spain’s backdoor and never left. After flying from New York City to Dublin, Dublin to London, and then taking the Eurostar train to Paris and then two other trains to Barcelona, I entered the capital of Catalonia wild-eyed and travel-weary.
It’s been my home ever since.
I left New York with a suitcase, a carry-on, no job, and very little in my bank account. Somehow, I made things work. It was here that I wrote two books: the first about my travels in a faraway and forgotten region in Southern Siberia and the second about my years of living in New York City. Despite working in the printing industry most of my life, I stumbled into a career as a freelance content writer after my first year as a resident of Barcelona.
Looking back on how I saw things when I first moved here, my thoughts about the city have changed. Not drastically, but I no longer see Barcelona through the naive eyes of a guiri, Spain’s equivalent of “gringo.” Contrary to most who took the plunge, I refuse to refer to myself as an ex-pat. Ex-pats, in my…

By Chris Wildgen, McMaster Alumna, travel writer, photographer and tour leader.
People often ask me whether they should go to Madrid or Barcelona. Both are fantastic cities and well worth visiting. With friends in both cities, it is very hard for me to choose.
While both offer museums, sports, nature, great food and wine, history and culture, each has its own personality, and there is definitely a strong rivalry — just ask soccer/football fans!
Barcelona was my first time in Spain when I did a home exchange that planted me in the heart of the tourist area near the Picasso Museum. Though it was January, it was busy and bustling. With almost everything within a thirty-minute walk, it was a great, central location.
Two main things differentiate Barcelona from Madrid. One is its location on the Mediterranean Sea. As a beach lover, I enjoyed visiting its smaller artist-dedicated museums (such as Picasso, Dali, or Miro) in the morning, followed by a lunch of fresh fish at a chiringuito on the beach. After lunch, the cement lounge chairs on the beach are an inviting place to have a siesta while enjoying the modern architecture along the seafront.
The second thing is the architecture of Antoni Gaudí, “God’s architect”, who is currently being considered for sainthood. A visit to la Sagrada Famiglia may convince anyone that it is well-deserved. A day can be spent just visiting this and his other buildings, with an afternoon spent in Parc Guell (advisable to pre-purchase tickets.) That Barcelona embraced Gaudí and his Catalan modernism reflects the spirit of the city.
Evening entertainment can include free concerts such as a free organ concert at the Cathedral or an event at the beautiful and fanciful Palau de la Música Catalana, where I attended a memorable performance by The Barcelona Guitar Trio and Dance.
From Barcelona, possible day trips in its region of Catalonia (Catalunya) are to Montserrat 11th century Catholic monastery, Dalí Museum in Figueres or Girona, Sitges, Girona and the Costa Brava.
Everything about Madrid reminds me that it is the capital of Spain. With its sophisticated yet confidently relaxed, big-city vibe, Madrid feels like a real city, not a tourist city. Full of wide boulevards and monumental buildings, it is both grand and accessible. From my hotel away from the city centre, I walked down the wide boulevard of Paseo de la Castellana, past monumental buildings such as the Bank of Spain, eventually turning on Gran Via to go towards the center.
Instead of turning on Gran Via, continuing on I arrived at Paseo del Prado and 3 world-famous museums –the Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Prado and the Reina-Sofia. Just a block away is one of my favourite city parks, the very large Parc Retiro. From early morning until late evening, people walk or run along the many intersecting paths, use the outdoor exercise area, visit the latest exhibition at the Crystal Palace, ride small boats in the mini lake in its center, or chat with friends while enjoying coffee at a café.
From there a 30-minute walk to the Royal Palace of Madrid goes through the geographical center of Spain (and the tourist center of Madrid) of Puerto Sol, which is full of restaurants, bars and shops.
For sports lovers (especially Real Madrid fans), the Real Madrid Museum and football (soccer) pitch are memorable, but it is even better to attend a game, especially if it is against Barcelona to experience the very strong rivalry between the capital of Catalonia and the capital of Spain.
Restaurants represent all regions from Spain, with fresh seafood from Galicia and the Mediterranean and wine from the entire country, though Rioja wines seem to be favoured.
There are also easy day trips from Madrid to El Escorial, Segovia with its Roman aqueduct, Avila with its 11th century city walls, the cathedral in Toledo. For more royal experience, a 40-minute train goes to the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. Even a visit to the Mediterranean is possible with a 2-hour high speed train that takes you from Atocha station to Valencia.
So, do you choose Madrid with its capital city vibe, royal palace, history, geographic accessibility, excellent restaurants from tapa bars to fine dining, world famous museums such as the Prado and the Thyssen, small museums such as the Sorollo?
Or do you choose Barcelona with its waterfront and beach, Catalonian language, history, food and pride, and the humility and magnificence of Gaudi?
Confident and sophisticated Madrid or fun and fanciful Barcelona? With just a train ride separating them, choose both!

before things get weird, and you wonder why I never mention this world-class city.
I have lived just outside the magestical metropolis of Barcelona for almost six years. I've dragged my husband to see most of the important works of art and architecture and taken my little art-enthusiast son on adventures to museums and shops, cafes, and kids' activities. It's a wonderful city filled with inspiration and mystery, bohemia and affluence.
As well my little family and I have traveled all around the Barcelona region, from days by the Mediterranean sea to skiing in the Pyrenees. Delightful vegan cafes to classy restos which promise vegan or vegetarian options. I've posted photos and maybe some videos on Instagram but never written a proper blog post.
A vegan meat and potatoes post about all my insights and perspectives, notions, and musings of my adopted home. I don't know why that is. To be honest, I could probably JUST write about the Barcelona region for the rest of my blogging days and do quite well. But for some reason, I don't.
I guess that happens. When you live in a world-class city, you eventually take it for granted.
So, it's 2023, and I'm going to start the year off right with a quick and snappy post about Barcelona…here goes.
Barcelona is a wonderful place to visit any time of year. Although, if you are more of an art, shopping, and dining tourist, I highly recommend the winter months. Nice weather without sweltering heat and smaller lineups to all of the beautiful sites to see.
Architect Antoni Gaudí's life work really is unlike anything you will ever see anywhere else. Park Güell, Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, and La Pedrera-Casa Milà are just some of the many whimsical buildings that this true patriot of Catalonia created. I say true patriot as Gaudí was a fierce supporter and defender of Catalan culture and language no matter how much trouble it caused him.
Barcelona is for everyone. Although Friday and Saturday nights can be a party, it is a great city for most kinds of travelers. Live large in luxury or stay at a backpackers. This city is a buzzing hotspot of activities for all ages. And if you have kids and stay for an extended amount of time, you will delight in all the activities and classes they have for little ones. I can't think of a better place to raise a small child, with all the festivals and parades, gargoyles, and dragons.
Barcelona is so multilingual. Of course, you will hear Catalan and Spanish the most, but on a busy day in the city center, you will hear almost as much French, Italian, German, you name it.
Barcelona has an amazing airport. Easy to get to from the city center- Plaça de Catalunya — Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport is a hub connecting you to pretty much anywhere you want to go…or at least to another airport that will take you anywhere you want to go, like Frankfurt, Paris, etc.
Sometimes, I yearn for the south more than my Andalusian husband ever has. I plead with him that we need to move to Seville and start our lives anew, leave all this chaos behind, and set our sights on one of the world's most important historical cities…but then he reminds me of the airport, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean sea and I calm down for a while.
So, in a nutshell, I truly adore my new home. I feel honored and amazed that I get to live here. I'm so Canadian and monolingual that I sometimes giggle nervously in shock as I hear my small son chattering on in Spanish or translate Catalan into English for my benefit.
I'm forever grateful for that trip I took in 2015 to Barcelona that made me want to come back and stay just long enough to feel what it would be like to live here. And on my second trip in 2016, I met a man from Seville who lived in Barcelona and would one day become mi marido.
So if I never mention Barcelona again, know it's because I'm busy thinking about other things, not because I'm not smitten.

Commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.
Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto “Més que un club” (“More than a club”).[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world’s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the “Cant del Barça”, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

This season began with a mix of emotions for FC Barcelona fans when the club decided to part ways with Xavi Hernández as head coach. For many, it was a shocking and divisive decision. Xavi had delivered a decent campaign last season, including winning La Liga in his first full season. He also introduced promising talents like Lamine Yamal and Cubarsi to the first team, showing his ability to develop young players.
Read to the end HERE
However, others, including myself to some extent, believed the move was a step in the right direction for the club. While Xavi’s impact on rebuilding the team was evident, his ability to guide Barcelona back to being genuine contenders for Europe’s top honours was unclear. The “New Era” Barcelona needed a coach with elite-level experience and tactical mastery to compete with Europe’s finest, and this is where Hansi Flick comes in.
When the club appointed Flick, fans welcomed the decision with great optimism and hope. His track record, particularly his remarkable feat with Bayern Munich, where he famously dismantled Barcelona 8-2 in the Champions League, spoke volumes about his capabilities. He is known as a disciplined, tactical coach who prioritizes structure and confidence, traits that were desperately needed to stabilize Barcelona.

How do I summarize Barcelona in one short piece? Perhaps I can’t, but here I will try my best to provide an introduction. With a population of 1.6 million, it is one of Europe’s largest cities and the continent’s fourth most visited city.
Located on the northeastern coast of Spain, Barcelona has sunny weather year-round and beaches stretching up and down and all along the Mediterranean. Restaurants aplenty, a thriving music scene, nightlife and outstanding Modernisme architecture on every street corner, it’s not surprising that Barcelona has become a top tourist destination for visitors hailing from all over the world.
Let’s start off with an overview of Barcelona’s most popular neighborhoods. Down by the beach, great seafood, surfing, and chiringuitos (beach bars) can be found in La Barceloneta. To the north lies Poble Nou, with tech start-ups scattered around the famous Agbar Tower. Back over to the east of Barceloneta is the Old City or the Ciutat Vella, which encompasses El Born and the Gothic Quarter, divided by Via Laietana. Here you’ll find old Roman excavations, medieval churches, with lots of small cafes and boutiques in between.
El Raval is the city’s more risqué part of town, be careful going here at night. Travel up the hill, eastward and you’ll hit the Eixample, Catalan for “expansion.” This area was built more recently, starting in the mid-1800s and is easy to navigate, with its wide avenues like Passeig de Gràcia and gridded plan. At the top of Passeig de Gràcia, you’ll enter into what was once a small village, La Vila de Gràcia or simply Gràcia.
Each neighborhood has its own personality which is one of the things that makes Barcelona such a vibrant and diverse place to live. If you want to see them all in one day, it is certainly possible, as Barcelona is bien comunicado or easy to get around.
Rent a bike for around 20 euros a day, or grab a T-10 card at one of the metro stations (10 rides for 10 euros) and use it for the metro, bus, tram, and even some regional trains. Taxis really aren’t necessary, unless the metro is closed… even then there are night buses! Side note: Barcelona’s metro operates from 5AM to 12AM from Sunday to Thursday. On Friday it stays open until 2AM, on Saturday it runs all night.
Biking is a smooth ride in this city. There are no steep hills in the center and Barcelona has an ecosystem of well-connected bike lanes. The same goes for the metro. Several lines run through the city with many connecting points and lots of friendly station managers willing to help you reach your destination. Or, just ask a local. Barcelonís are quite friendly and relaxed and used to seeing tourists. They even have a name for them here, guiris.

Being the capital of the autonomous region of Catalunya, Barcelona and the surrounding area have their own traditions, many involving food. Lots of the ingredients, the recipes, the celebrations, and the rituals differ from the rest of Spain. At the same time, it has always been a cosmopolitan place, a terre de pas, and its traditions have been influenced for centuries by foreigners who pass through or settle down. Vice’s Mikel Iturriaga explains:
“Catalans mix meat and seafood in the same recipe — it’s called mar i muntanya, which means “sea and mountain” in Catalan — in a way that seems rather odd in the rest of Spain. And Catalans have a huge tradition of pork sausages — fuets, butifarras — but they don’t use paprika in them, like in chorizo. They also like garlic A LOT, and their most distinctive sauces aioli [“garlic and oil” in Catalan], or romesco, are definitely not suitable for vampires. They have quite unique ways to treat vegetables, burning their skins to get them a smoky flavor, like in escalivada, or to thicken sauces in fish or meat stews. Flour is never really used, but a “picada” (an almond, parsley and garlic mix) gets added at the end of the cooking process. Oh! And they invented one of the best things in the whole world: pa amb tomàquet, toasted bread scrubbed with ripe fresh tomato, garlic, salt, and olive oil.”
Like in other parts of Spain, a Catalan’s daily schedule is a bit unique. Meals happen a lot later than in the rest of the world, and there are different types of meals such as la comida, tapas, and pintxos. Catalans eat breakfast around 10 or 11 AM, and lunch at 2 or 3 PM during siesta. Dinner doesn’t happen until 9 or 10 PM; most restaurants won’t open for dinner until about 8:30 PM (unless they are in a touristic neighborhood).
Part of this could be attributed to people wanting to seek shelter to avoid the intense, midday heat. Other people point out that Spain is not in the correct timezone.
Back in the day, the country’s clocks were set to the same hour as the UK and Portugal, calculated using the mean solar time. But on March 16, 1940, Spain’s brutal dictator, Francisco Franco, changed the time from 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM to display the same time as Nazi Germany and other Nazi-occupied countries further east. As Lauren Frayer of NPR explains, this was done to show support for the fascist government of Germany. To this day, Spain is not in its natural time zone, though there is talk of changing it back.
As I’ve mentioned, lunch is the biggest meal of the day in Spain. While it is falling out of tradition, many people take a break from work and go home to eat lunch. For this reason, most smaller stores will be closed for siesta between 2 and 4 PM (or 5 PM).
The menu del día involves a lot of food and is surprisingly easy on the wallet. What is it? Usually, it is a three-course meal, drink included, that is offered on weekdays at lunchtime. Most restaurants will have a sign outside advertising their offerings, with several first courses, second courses, and desserts to choose from. If you go to a truly authentic place they will sometimes leave a bottle of house wine on the table (don’t get too greedy!). Prices vary from 7 to 15 euros per person, depending on where you go. Tip: this is a great way to try the food at a nicer establishment at a reduced rate.
In Barcelona, tapas are small plates of food meant to be shared and usually accompanied by a glass of wine or beer. There are several theories surrounding the emergence of tapas. The most fun involves a king with an illness and a special diet (consisting of small snacks throughout the day) who demanded that all alcoholic beverages be served with a bite of food. The most practical story is that barmen began covering drinks with a slice of bread or cheese to prevent flies from taking a bath in patrons’ drinks.
I have to agree with Mikel Iturriaga when he recommends avoiding touristic restaurants (if they have a laminated menu outside in 10 thousand languages and an aggressive waiter beckoning you in, run for your life!) Instead, Iturriaga recommends trying “unpretentious restaurants like Envalira or Casa Agustí, or new places like Suculent or Mont Bar, where they give the old Catalan dishes a modern twist.” He also mentions a few of Barcelona’s traditional bodegas or small wine shops where you can sample different wines and tapas: Bodega Montferry, Bodega Salvat, Cal Marino, or Bodega Quimet which are all excellent and easy on the wallet.
Another fun food to try are pintxos or small bites of food with a toothpick on top. They are normally displayed on top of bars, to be eaten with a glass of wine or beer. Though not originally from Barcelona, pintxos bars can be found all across the city. In fact, there is one magical street you must check out: Carrer de Blai. Carrer de Blai is a pedestrian walkway lined with outdoor terraces serving pintxos. Each restaurant does them differently, so you can hop from one to the next, sampling whichever bite-sized delicacy looks best to you. The barman will charge you based on the number of toothpicks left on your plate when you’ve finished your meal. For a list of the best pintxos in Barcelona, check out Barcelona Hacks’ recommendations.
Catalan food leads us to another topic… Catalan culture. Barcelona is the center of an area proudly known as Catalunya, one of 17 autonomous regions in Spain. Catalunya has made worldwide headlines in recent years from the Independence Movement that has been taking place, most notably with the elections in 2017. It has its own language, customs, traditions, food, many of which differ from those in other parts of Spain: a controversial ban on bullfighting, the caga tió at Christmastime, and the castellers, to name a few. Catalunya prides itself on innovation, art, and as you will see, architecture.
Barcelona’s three patron saints are Santa Eulalia, Santa Mercè, and Sant Jordi… and well, maybe we can consider the fourth unofficial saint to be Antoni Gaudí, the city’s celebrated Modernisme architect. Some of his most famous works include:
Gaudí always turned to nature when it came to his designs, for he felt there was nothing man could make that nature had not already created. As author Robert Hughes writes in the Guardian:
“He never ceased to draw on nature. Each paving-block of Passeig de Gracia features a starfish and an octopus, originally designed for the Casa Batlló. Turtles and tortoises support the columns of the Nativity facade of the Sagrada Familia, which also has 30 different species of stone plant copied from the vegetation of Catalunya and the Holy Land.”
Following Greek tradition, Gaudí even used living people as models, casting them in plaster to create his sculptures for La Sagrada Familia. But maybe Gaudí took his obsession with Mother Nature too far. In creating the church’s “Massacre of the Innocents” scene, he asked a hospital on Las Ramblas if he could cast the corpses of stillborn babies in plaster. He must have made a solid case, for they agreed.
The city lost its beloved architect in 1926, several days after Gaudí was hit by a tram while crossing Gran Vía de les Corts Catalanes. At 74 years old he was completely focused on constructing La Sagrada Familia. At this point, he had become depressed and stopped taking care of himself. His hair and beard were long and unruly, his clothing tattered, and when the police arrived at the scene they thought he was a beggar. In these times the poor were not adequately taken care of and he did not receive proper treatment.
When you look up things to do in Barcelona, you’re sure to find the Barcelona Cathedral listed as one of the must-see attractions. However, my favorite church is not technically a cathedral, though it is referred to as one. Catedral del Mar, or “Cathedral by the Sea,” is the scene of a new Netflix series by the same name.
The church dates back to the 1300s and is located in Barcelona’s El Born district, next to a lovely old square that was used for local festivities, celebrations, and events during the Middle Ages. Unlike the Barcelona Cathedral, which was funded by and built for the bourgeoisie class, the Catedral del Mar was funded by, built for, and built by the fisherman and port workers living in the surrounding neighborhood of La Ribera. Known as bastaixos, the men who built the church carried each individual stone on their backs all the way from a quarry in Montjuic. If you’d like to understand how arduous this was, you can follow the bastaixos’ 8-kilometer walk that has been recreated by RouteYou.
If you are an FC Barcelona fan, you’ll also have a good reason to visit the church. If you spend enough time inside staring up at its stained glass windows you’ll find a small FC Barcelona shield embedded in one of the designs. Back in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, a group of anarchists set the church on fire, destroying much of the artwork inside including the windows. In the 1960s, FC Barcelona donated money to help restore the building, and the shield was added as a small thank you.
One thing to keep in mind: always keep an eye on your stuff, especially in the metro and near major tourist attractions. While Barcelona is an extremely safe city in terms of violent crime, pickpocketing is a big problem here. Many people even wear special pickpocket-proof bags, though I think holding your backpack in front of your chest on the train is sufficient.
I’m a big fan of off-season travel: if you go in the fall, winter or even early spring, you’ll escape a lot of the crowds but more importantly the heat waves that sweep the city in summer. You’ll also save a bit on flights and accommodation. If you do decide to visit Barcelona during the summer, my recommendation is to spend some time away from the city itself. Rent a car and explore beaches along the Costa Brava, or out in the Balearic Islands. Barcelona is hot and humid in July and August, and, to be frank, the cleaner beaches (with fewer bachelor parties) can only be found by getting out of town.
Of course, this isn’t actually “all you need to know about Barcelona.” Here I’ve only skimmed the surface of Barcelona’s rich history, architecture, cuisine, and art. There is so much more to be discovered in this Mediterranean paradise that my sister jokingly referred to as “Magic Land” during her visit last summer. It’s a place to disfrutarse, to slow down, to have long lunches and to soak in the strong sun that rarely sees a cloud obstruct its rays.

“I’m Sexy And I Know It,” the top hit from 2011 sung by LMAO blared from the car radio. My kids and I belted the lyrics while we waited for my husband, Eric, to return from the bank with dollars exchanged for Euros.
We were traveling to the airport to catch a flight to Barcelona.
Six months earlier, Eric discovered a website that listed flight prices across the globe. Barcelona had the lowest fares, so we booked our family vacation.
Part of our overseas adventure would include a football game. I knew nothing about the sport, but I did know that two teens would want more than just museum tours on their vacay.
We had no idea what an adventure going to Camp Nou Stadium would be. It was September 2011. FC Barcelona was playing Real Madrid CF.
Of course, we needed the right outfits to cheer on our new favorite team.
We dressed in our athletic best and proceeded to the stadium.
Barcelona was one of the most accessible cities we’d ever been to, but subways in many cities are notorious for being frustrating obstacles for the disabled. Our daughter is paralyzed and has…

Recommended time of stay 1.5 weeks
Overall Vibe of the place: fun, touristy, energetic, friendly
Barcelona! Wow what a perfect place to start off my solo trip, it is full of life, architecture, friendly people. It just has this fun, friendly party vibe to it with so much to see. But it also has a huge amount of tourists so be ready for lots of people walking around with camera’s, there are also a lot of pickpockets especially in the touristy areas so be sure to watch your stuff. My friend came to visit me in Barcelona and got his wallet stolen and was only there for like 4 days. It’s definitely a huge problem but you should be fine as long as you are careful.
There really is so much to see in Barcelona but here are my top places that just really stood out.
If there is one place you need to go to in Barcelona it is the Sagrada Famillia. My heart literally jumps every time I see it, the architecture is just so detailed and fantastical, I was amazed to find a new thing every time I examined the structure. With detailed carving all around, mosaic tiles, and words all around the building it is the most interesting beautiful building I’ve ever seen in my life. It kind of reminds me of a magical and very detailed sand castle.
Now to go over the inside, I would say it is worth is to see it on the outside just onlooking the building but it is even MORE worth it to go inside. I got so emotional inside I literally had to cry a little because it was just so beautiful I couldn’t believe it. With tall grand high ceilings meant to replicate trees, and rainbow colors of light reflecting through the windows it just had this sacred feeling to it. I’m pretty sure I stayed inside for at least an hour just looking around taking it all in. I honestly can’t compare it to any other place I’ve been to. It sort of has this sci-fi feeling to it like your in a futuristic spaceship or something. I love Gaudis work for his uses of curves, and combining classical architectural ideas with natural subjects and designs.
A little about the building, it was built by Antoni Gaudi and it is so detailed it is still not complete yet but is projected to be done in 2026 (I can’t wait to see it completed!) to coincide with Gaudi’s death in 1926. Gaudi’s body is also buried inside of the Sagrada Famillia which makes sense since he dedicated part of his life to working on this structure and never worried about how long it would take. I guess this really teaches you truly great things take a lot of time.
Also I recommend you purchase your tickets AT LEAST 3 days in advanced I bought mine 2 weeks in advance which you don’t need to do but they sell out very fast.
Another building designed by the great Antoni Gaudi (he really is a genius and I wish I could’ve met him). Located in the Illa de la Discòrdia and commissioned by Josep Battló who was a wealthy textile manufacturer. He gave Gaudi full creative access to do whatever he pleased and boy did he. Their are no straight edges throughout the entire building and it has this sort of under water playful aquatic feel to it. When I was climbing up the stairs I felt as if I was in a pool of some sort. Once you get to the top you have an stunning view of the city along with mosaic designs throughout the top area. I’ve never been in any place like this and I don’t think there are many building out there with these types of designs so it is a must see especially for architecture lovers.
I will admit this is a very touristy area but I can definitely see why, I love walking through the small alleys with beautiful windows and architectural designs with every step you take. Also I’m not a big person for tourist shops but these shops seemed less basic and more interesting. I bought a handmade leather bracelet as my tourist item and the women makes all of it there she even sized it in front of me to fit my tiny wrist haha. The restaurants are all fantastic in this location and be sure to buy some hot chocolate they have rich, thick hot chocolate almost everywhere you go, its basically hot pudding and it is heaven.
Right in the Gothic District is the Gothic Quarter and it is free to go in at the right times (From 8 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. to 7:30 p.m) otherwise you just need to pay a donation fee. The building took almost 2 centuries to build, yeah thats right and you can tell walking past it you can’t help but stop and stare and it to take in all the elegance of it.
This is the beach to go to just to sit and relax, its right next to the Gothic Quarter so its the perfect place to take in some sun after walking around all day. The water is really warm I even checked it out at night and it was still warm and swimmable. Theres a lot of young tourists here and it’s next to all the nightlife happening so this is the place to be.
The Picasso Museum is one of the best museums to go to for all you Picasso fans out there. It shows his evolution as an artist and how he did different things at different periods in his life. I have to say I was very pulled into his simple pencil and paper drawings since I like to draw myself it was refreshing to see some his mistakes and messy lines which really reassured me as an artist that everyone makes mistakes. It also showed me that it is completely normal to go through different design periods throughout your life. His work really took me away and brought me into his most memorable times in his life. I didn’t realize this till later but the museum is free Thursday nights from 6:30–9:00pm to try to check it out then.
Another wonderful achievement by Antoni Gaudi, originally a garden city and later commissioned by Eusebi Güell to redesign it. He continues with his playful, colorful, and smooth designs throughout the park. He wanted to keep its natural design and just build on top of that. While adding detailed mosaic tiles and keeping the natural ground stones all over the park. Not to mention the spectacular view you get of the entire city in the park, this is definitely a place you wouldn’t want to miss.
This is the club I went to to see one of my favorite bands and the show was amazing but I was blown away by the club myself. This is a place where people come for music and I can tell I even made some friends on the rooftop of the club. There is a stairwell section with red lights and the design of it just really surprised and delighted me. No one was pushy here and the drinks weren’t too much definitely a place to check out if your into live music.
Since I was in Spain I had to try out the rich thick hot chocolate that they seemed to have everywhere and hands down this place is the best. I can really tell the quality and taste is truly exquisite. I love the interior of this place also it’s really great for just working on your computer and relaxing and the staff was very friendly and polite.
Located in Catalonia, Spain this huge museum is surely a place to check out while you’re in Barcelona. They have all different types of artwork throughout history ranging from gothic artwork to renaissance showing how history has made art evolve throughout time. They also have a featured side exhibit at the museum, when I went it was Dali and Gala and how they both inspired each other with their artwork. This is a huge museum so be sure to plan staying for the full day (I would say 2–4 hours at least).
I really hope this helps you out on your next trip to Barcelona and let me know if you do go to any of these places!

Intro
As someone who wakes up early, I have come to appreciate breakfast out of the house more and more. Either as a solitary occasion to gather my thoughts, take time out, and plan for the day, or as a social event with a like-minded early riser, usually a fellow entrepreneur in my case, such as my good friend and local businessman Gunter, who is in the sex shop business, but that is a curious side note. We all know having variety in your personal and business network is wise!
So, after doing the rounds and trying several breakfast places out, a few good, some mediocre, and many terrible, I want to document my own personal top 4 in Barcelona.
If you are looking for coffee shops or patisseries, this will not be the article for you. There is an abundance of these in the city. Being an amateur athlete (I say that very loosely, as if football and gym sessions count for something) and a growing boy, I need some protein for breakfast, so to qualify for my list, the places needed to have some solid egg-based or protein dishes as menu mainstays. Also, and I must be pedantic on this, I am talking strictly about breakfast, and not what has come to be the trend in recent years — dare I say it — brunch! Please allow me to go on a tangent here before we get to my list, but I am pretty much anti-brunch and anti a lot of what brunch represents. Don’t get me wrong, the dishes are nice, but the concept of mid-morning eating of what is essentially breakfast for late risers and posers is not my cup of tea. I’m here for the good old-fashioned pre-10:00 a.m. breakfast, or 08:00 on the dot if I can get it.
So here is my list, as a local in Barcelona and in no particular order of ranking:
№1: El Corte Inglés
Plaça de Catalunya, 14, 08002 Barcelona
Classic, no-nonsense, and great price point. Open from 09:00, you can choose from either an omelette and toast or freshly made Tortilla de Patatas with toast. Located pretty centrally in Plaza Catalunya.
№2: Café de l’Architecte
Rambla de Catalunya, 76, 08008 Barcelona (attached to Hotel Condes de Barcelona)
A bar and restaurant attached to the hotel Hotel Condes which sits on the corner of Rambla Catalunya with Passatge de la Concepció. It’s a nice spot and an intimate meeting point. Open from 09:00, it would be great if it opened at 08:00, but I guess they don’t see too much demand for that. They offer a nice variation of choices and additional ingredients for your omelette or scrambled eggs. If they were to add some artisanal coffee and tea options, to their menu it would be a plus, but I will cut them some slack on this, as the establishment has an air of the traditional to it.
№3: Billy Brunch
Various locations throughout the city.
One of the best for options, variety, and choice. It’s probably better known as a brunch spot, but it opens at 09:30 for people like myself who value breakfast over brunch. I’ve been to various locations of theirs throughout the city, and I’m yet to be disappointed by the service. There is thought attached to the attention to detail of the service at Billy Brunch, which I love especially because Barcelona restaurants often struggle to offer good service, mainly because they probably don’t feel they need to make an effort with such a high footfall of tourists and transient clientele walking in. Billy Brunch however bucks that trend, and they make a fantastic Chai Latte, one of the better ones in the city actually which is always a plus for me as someone who doesn’t drink coffee.
№4: Citizen Café
Pl. d’Urquinaona, 4, L’Eixample, 08010 Barcelona
One of the few good breakfast places in Barcelona that opens from 08:00. This spot became my place for post-early-morning gym session fuelling. Located in Urquinaona and with a wide variety of menu options, this is breakfast done well and at the proper time for those of us who have busy days ahead and things to get on with. The staff have been very pleasant here in my experience. Like the other options that serve brunch, this place starts to fill up quite quickly. It’s been a few weeks since I’ve been myself, so I’m looking forward to heading back here soon.
There might be some options that are new or that I am not aware of. I typically value a central location if I am meeting people, so maybe there are local spots in Barcelona’s neighbourhoods that I should consider. By the way, if you’re local and in business like myself and fancy joining me next time for a networking breakfast, shoot me a message. Remember, breakfast not brunch! And if you are visiting this wonderful city and looking for some early-opening, good options for breakfast, then I hope you enjoy these recommendations and let me know how you get on with them in the comments.

Have you ever wondered how a storied club like FC Barcelona tackles financial challenges while enhancing fan engagement? In today’s evolving sports landscape, Barcelona has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) as a crucial tool for improvement. By integrating AI into various operations, the club aims to elevate on-field performance, enhance fan experiences, and make smarter financial decisions. This transformation illustrates how innovation can lead to sustainable success in a highly competitive environment.
In recent years, Barcelona has faced significant financial hurdles, accumulating a staggering debt of €1.35 billion. In light of this daunting reality, the club recognized the importance of harnessing technology to strengthen connections with its vast global fan base. The sports world has seen how data-driven approaches can personalize experiences, enabling organizations to better understand and cater to the preferences of their supporters. By leveraging AI, Barcelona is positioning itself to innovate and thrive amidst challenges.
One of Barcelona’s innovative steps into AI is the implementation of AI-powered chatbots designed to engage fans in real time. These chatbots provide personalized content based on individual preferences, making interactions feel tailored and efficient. Fans can quickly find answers to questions about ticket purchases or player stats, simulating a conversation with a knowledgeable friend. This not only enhances the fan experience but also drives merchandise sales. Studies show that 69% of consumers prefer chatbots for fast communication with brands, reflecting the growing expectation for swift responses in today’s digital world.
These chatbots are adept at handling up to 80% of routine customer service inquiries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex issues. In many industries, organizations have turned to AI to enhance customer service, enabling faster responses and improving overall satisfaction. Barcelona’s approach illustrates a blend of technology and personal touch, emphasizing the importance of understanding fan needs and preferences.
Barcelona has also embraced AI algorithms to analyze fan data and deliver personalized content. By tailoring news articles, videos, and social media posts to individual preferences, the club significantly enhances the overall engagement of its supporters. The club’s dedicated Twitter account for personalized content has witnessed a remarkable 30% increase in engagement compared to its main account. This level of engagement mirrors the success of leading brands that utilize consumer data to create relevant experiences, ultimately driving sales.
Furthermore, this personalized content strategy has resulted in a 25% increase in the time fans spend on Barcelona’s digital platforms. Insights from behavioral psychology emphasize that when users feel valued and recognized, they are more likely to engage with a brand. By leveraging AI for tailored content, Barcelona fosters a deeper connection with its supporters, ensuring they feel appreciated and involved in the club’s journey.
Barcelona’s commitment to innovation extends to its training facilities through a partnership with Pixellot, which has developed AI-based video analysis systems. This technology automates the recording of training sessions and matches, providing coaches with in-depth insights into player performance. In the competitive world of sports, analytics have become essential, much like how successful teams leverage data to inform strategies and enhance player development.
The impact of AI-driven video analysis has been significant, with coverage now expanded to 16 pitches across Barcelona’s complexes. This increased visibility has enabled the club to broadcast previously unproduced youth matches, resulting in a staggering 40% increase in viewership. Such advancements illustrate how data analytics can reveal opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed, allowing teams to engage more deeply with fans and cultivate future talent.
In addition to enhancing fan interactions and on-field performance, Barcelona utilizes AI tools to analyze fan preferences and behaviors. This strategic approach allows the club to create more effective marketing strategies and build deeper connections with its audience. For example, AI-driven insights have led to a remarkable 20% increase in merchandise sales, illustrating the power of targeted marketing efforts.
Moreover, Barcelona has achieved a 15% improvement in fan engagement metrics across its digital platforms. This proactive stance reflects the importance of data-driven decision-making in today’s business landscape, where understanding consumer behavior can lead to substantial gains. These insights highlight how critical it is for organizations to stay attuned to the needs and desires of their audience.
The cumulative impact of these AI-driven initiatives has been impressive. Barcelona has reported a 35% increase in digital engagement year-over-year and has expanded its global fan base from 250 million to an estimated 350 million supporters. This growth illustrates that fans are not just passive observers; they are actively involved in the club’s journey and development.
While the advancements in AI present a promising future, the club also faces challenges, particularly in data collection. Despite its massive fan base, as of 2022, Barcelona held detailed data on only about 1% of its supporters, highlighting a critical area for improvement. This situation emphasizes the need for organizations to continually enhance their data strategies to build stronger connections with their audiences.
Barcelona’s successful integration of AI not only enhances performance but also presents a unique business opportunity model for other clubs and organizations. By focusing on fan engagement, personalized marketing, and data analysis, sports teams can cultivate a loyal fan base and drive revenue growth. The lessons learned from Barcelona’s journey serve as a blueprint for others looking to navigate similar challenges and harness the power of technology in sports.
Moreover, this model isn’t limited to sports; businesses in various sectors can leverage similar strategies. The principles of personalization and data-driven decision-making are increasingly becoming standard practices across industries. In a world where consumer preferences are constantly evolving, understanding and adapting to these changes is essential for long-term success.
Ultimately, Barcelona’s journey into AI amidst financial struggles offers valuable life lessons. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances is vital, both in sports and in life. By embracing innovation, individuals and businesses can overcome obstacles and create new opportunities. As author and philosopher Alain de Botton reminds us in The Art of Travel: “We are often at our most interesting when we are in a state of uncertainty.” Barcelona’s story illustrates how a shared passion for the game can unite fans and inspire creative problem-solving.
As we reflect on Barcelona’s commitment to AI and fan engagement, it’s clear that the essence of connection — whether with fans, customers, or communities — remains paramount. Building relationships rooted in understanding and empathy can lead to enduring success. In a world of rapid change, the lessons learned from Barcelona’s experience serve as a reminder that with innovation and resilience, the future can be brighter than ever. (Dadang Irsyamuddin)

Barça’s 2023–24 season is being far from good. They’re currently 6 points away from the leader but with one more match played — so the difference could rise to 9 points today — and the number of goals they’ve received this year in 18 games is already higher than the total goals from last season.
Not good defensively, but the offense doesn’t compensate for it.
In this post, I’ll oversimplify the causes of Barça’s situation focusing on numbers only. Of course, these only explain half the equation: the apathy or lack of motivation we’re seeing on the pitch can’t be translated into numbers… Yet.
But stats are rather the consequence of these psychological factors.
If you’re a FCB fan and have been following their last games, I might not discover anything new here. But I believe this could be a good read for those who don’t and those who want to learn how to use stats to understand the game.
Here’s a summary of Barça’s last 5 matches, ordered chronologically:

In the words of the celebrated author Paulo Coelho, “The danger of adventure is worth a thousand days of ease and comfort.” With this profound quotation in mind, I embarked on a thrilling journey to the captivating city of Barcelona. Armed with an open heart and a sense of wanderlust, I set out to explore the enchanting streets, immerse myself in the vibrant culture, and discover the untold stories that lay hidden beneath its façade. Little did I know that this adventure would lead me to encounter unexpected encounters with diverse souls from across the globe, each contributing to the kaleidoscope of experiences that shaped my time in Barcelona. Join me as I unravel the tale of my adventurous sojourn, where the allure of the unknown merged seamlessly with the promise of self-discovery. This is a chronicle of courage, resilience, and the magic that unfolds when we dare to step outside our comfort zones and embrace the uncharted path. Welcome to My Barcelona Adventure.
Making the trip
Attending an international school with the power of a Schengen passport and having a bunch of GenZ classmates, I felt the pressure to travel, explore the world, and find peace out of my comfort zone. It took me five months to gather the courage to leave Madrid. Initially, I had plans to visit a Liberian in Barcelona whom I didn’t know much about, but she had assured me of taking good care of me and showing me around the city. Our conversation started back in November 2022, and I had considered traveling in December 2022 during our most extended school break when everyone was going to their home country to see their family and loved ones. However, I had to prioritize completing my NIE process — to obtain a resident permit for my studies at IE Business School. Then, I postponed the trip to January 2023, and later to February 2023, feeling unsure and indecisive. Finally, I decided to take the plunge and booked a train within a week, thanks to the stipend from my scholarship.
I informed my Liberian “host” that I was finally coming to Barcelona. I shared my travel details and attempted to have a phone conversation, but she was primarily busy or unresponsive. Nonetheless, I didn’t ask her directly if she would be hosting me, as she had previously promised to show me around.
The scheduled trip was set for 8 pm after the end of our second term, and while everyone else seemed excited, I found myself feeling a bit bored (details that I will highlight in a subsequent blog). But despite the mixed emotions, there was an underlying sense of excitement as I was finally going to spend an amazing weekend in Barcelona. Everything was seemingly set for my adventure.
Dammit!
Just as I was about to board the train to Barcelona, I received a message from my host:
“Did you book an Airbnb?”
Oh no! I realized that I had made a mistake. I should have clarified the accommodation arrangements with her beforehand. I replied, admitting that I hadn’t booked an Airbnb, but I also didn’t explicitly mention my assumption that she would be hosting me. During the two-hour trip from Madrid to Barcelona, I frantically searched for a suitable and affordable Airbnb, but to my dismay, the prices were about 20% higher in Barcelona compared to Madrid. I couldn’t find any suitable option during the train journey, and so I arrived in Barcelona Sants, the train station, without a place to stay.
My Liberian “host” had initially assured me that she would pick me up from Barcelona Sants upon my arrival. However, as I reached out to inform her of my presence, she regretfully informed me that she couldn’t fulfill her promise. Her friend, who was supposed to provide the transportation, had become occupied with other matters. I found myself stranded at Barcelona Sants, the clock ticking closer to midnight, and the weight of the situation settling upon me.
In this unexpected situation, I had no choice but to find an available Airbnb and get myself out of the train station as soon as possible. The stress of the moment was mounting, and I knew I had to act swiftly to secure a place to stay for the night.
Fortunately, I managed to find a suitable place called Hola Hostel, which perfectly fit my criteria of being affordable and charming. The added bonus was its convenient location, just a short 3-minute walk away from Spotify Camp Nou. With a sense of relief, I made my way to the nearest metro station, ready to face the challenges of navigating Barcelona without the aid of Google Maps since my phone had switched off.
Despite the hurdles and occasional moments of uncertainty, I arrived safely at Hola Hostel. The staff was welcoming, and I arranged my accommodation for the next two nights. It felt like a small victory, given the earlier setback, and I was eager to make the most of my time in Barcelona, even without my phone’s constant guidance.
I went to bed by 2:00 AM
The Indian Couple
When I arrived at Hola Hostel, I immediately headed for a refreshing shower in one of the bathrooms. The following day, on February 25, 2023, I returned to the bathroom to brush my teeth but inadvertently left my toothpaste behind. Upon getting my toothpaste and exiting the bathroom, I bumped into a friendly lady named Divya, who was standing at the door. I could tell from her expression that she was a bit surprised to see me, as the bathroom was probably designated for females only. Realizing my mistake, I felt a bit embarrassed, but Divya was understanding and welcoming, which helped ease my discomfort.
In an attempt to make up for my awkward encounter, I struck up a conversation with Divya. Curious to know more about her, I asked where she was from. She shared that she was from India and currently studying in Austria. Learning that she was also a tourist like me, I asked about her plans for the day. I had little faith in my Liberian “host”, given the earlier miscommunication, and was looking for an enjoyable day out in Barcelona. Divya mentioned that she and her boyfriend, Kabir, were going to the stadium, specifically Camp Nou. To my surprise, she kindly invited me to join them.
Although I had initially hoped for a spontaneous adventure with a fellow solo traveler, I was still excited to explore Camp Nou with the couple. Despite my mixed emotions, I found Kabir to be friendly and welcoming as well. Our trip to the stadium turned out to be a wonderful experience, and I was grateful for the unexpected company and the opportunity to share this adventure with new friends.
After Camp Nou, what’s next?
Everyone should visit Camp Nou or a football stadium as beautiful and historic as Camp Nou at least once in their lifetime. Even though I am not a Barcelona fan, my visit to Camp Nou brought me closer to the team, enriched me with its history, and made me appreciate the beauty of football even more. We embarked on a comprehensive 360 tour of the stadium, and in my enthusiasm, I found myself lagging behind a couple of times, giving them some privacy for romantic moments, and bombarding them with numerous questions. Divya and Kabir, while initially patient, seemed to become a bit exasperated with my curiosity.
At the end of the tour, they mentioned that they were planning to find an Indian restaurant to have lunch. However, when I asked to join them, they hesitated and said they would be meeting some friends, leaving me to figure out my next move. It was already 1:00 pm, and I hadn’t received any communication from my Liberian “host” yet. The uncertainty of my situation started to weigh on me as I contemplated what to do next in this unfamiliar city.
After the somewhat awkward situation at Spotify Camp Nou, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I spotted a McDonald’s nearby and saw it as an opportunity to charge my phone and grab some lunch. It was a relieving break, allowing me to regroup and plan my next steps.
Around 2:00 PM, I finally received a response from my Liberian “host”. She once again apologized for not being able to pick me up from the Hostel as promised, explaining that her friend was occupied. While I appreciated her honesty, I couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed by the turn of events. Nevertheless, we had a brief chat, and she recommended some places for me to explore in Barcelona.
Equipped with her suggestions and a charged phone, I set out to make the most of the remainder of the day. I embraced the idea of navigating the city on my own, using the newfound freedom to delve into the sights and sounds of Barcelona, appreciating every moment of this unplanned adventure.
With a sense of excitement and curiosity, I made up my mind to visit the renowned Sagrada Familia, the largest unfinished Roman Catholic church in the world. I navigated my way to the nearest metro station, and to my delight, I encountered a kind-hearted Colombian individual who communicated with me through sign language. Sergio’s warm demeanor and willingness to assist me made me feel at ease.
With Sergoi’s help, I confirmed that I was headed in the right direction to reach Sagrada Familia. He even suggested a sightseeing tour of the exterior of the magnificent building, which seemed like a wonderful idea to me. Instead of paying 50 euros to see the interior, I opted for the chance to marvel at the breathtaking architecture from the outside.
Throughout the journey on the metro, Sergio continued to wear a beautiful smile, making me feel grateful for their company and guidance. He reminded me to be careful and watchful during our ride together, emphasizing the importance of safety.
I arrived at my destination and bid Sergio farewell as he was stopping at the next metro and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude for this serendipitous encounter. I embarked on my sightseeing adventure, eager to explore the awe-inspiring beauty of Sagrada Familia, while cherishing the memory of the unexpected friendship formed through a shared moment of communication.
Oh my gosh!
Sagrada Familia is indeed a breathtaking marvel. This awe-inspiring cathedral, designed by the visionary architect Antoni Gaudí, commenced its construction in 1882. Gaudí’s artistic genius and innovative architectural concepts have left an indelible mark on the world, making Sagrada Familia a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate hearts and minds.
Standing outside Sagrada Familia felt like stepping into a diverse paradise. Conversations in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese intermingled, creating a vibrant tapestry of languages and cultures. The scene was nothing short of beautiful, with a lively and diverse crowd filling the air with excitement and energy. Among the approximately 200 people surrounding me, all on their own purported pilgrimage to this grand cathedral, I stood as a solo traveler, somewhat frustrated with my Liberian “host”, yet elated to be present at Sagrada Familia in that very moment.
At the cathedral’s entrance, a multitude of tourists buzzed with activity, some trying to enter, while others were exiting. The atmosphere was warm and electric, as people chatted, danced, sang, and savored their meals. The ambiance was alive with a festive spirit.
I took my time exploring the surroundings, capturing precious moments through photographs, walking amidst the crowd, and savoring the melodic tunes of Spanish guitarists. However, after about an hour and thirty minutes, I craved a different experience. The time neared 5:00 PM, and still, there had been no word from my Liberian “host”.
Abdelali and how we found each other
Just as I was about to check my phone and prepare to leave the grounds of Sagrada Familia, a gentle touch on my back startled me. Hoping to find a fellow solo traveler, perhaps an English-speaking lady, eager to explore like myself, I turned around, only to meet the gaze of a fair-skinned young man with a shy expression. He stood at an average height, and with a friendly smile, he made a simple request, “Can you take my picture?”
Intrigued, I gladly obliged and inquired about his name. He introduced himself as Abdelali, a Moroccan student studying in France, who had come to Barcelona for a vacation. Abdelali, as it turned out, was quite the seasoned traveler himself. Having lived in Ukraine and explored various destinations within the Schengen area, he had accumulated a wealth of experiences and stories.
Our conversation flowed effortlessly as I expressed my eagerness for the next adventure and sought his recommendations. “Can we go to the beach?” I asked him. Graciously, Abdelali agreed to accompany me on this new escapade, explaining that he also had a booking issue to resolve with an Airbnb on the nearby beach.
With a newfound travel companion by my side, I felt a renewed sense of excitement and anticipation. Barcelona’s beach beckoned, and with Abdelali as my guide, I knew this impromptu journey would be filled with unforgettable moments and the shared joy of exploration. Together, we embarked on our beach adventure, ready to embrace the unknown and cherish the bond formed through the serendipity of travel.
Within about 30 minutes, Abdelali and I managed to find the nearest metro station, and with ease, we hopped on a bus that swiftly transported us to Barceloneta, the most renowned and beloved beach in Barcelona. As my eyes beheld the splendor of the beach, the swaying palm trees, and the vast expanse of the ocean, my soul felt an immediate revival. The stress and worries of the day seemed to dissipate, replaced by a profound sense of relief, and I prepared to immerse myself in the wonders of nature.
It had been a long five months since I last set eyes on a beach, and Barceloneta turned out to be the most stunning one I had ever encountered. The beach exuded a lively and vibrant atmosphere, adorned with the rhythmic sounds of Spanish music and the delightful aroma of typical Spanish cuisine that enveloped the air. The sun radiated warmth, casting its golden rays upon everything in its path, bringing joy to every heart and a smile to every face.
As I strolled along the shoreline, my spirit lifted with every turn and every glance at the people around me. The beach was a lively tapestry of young and old people engaged in joyful activities such as singing, dancing, riding bicycles, or simply relishing delightful conversations with their friends. After assisting Abdelali in resolving his Airbnb issue, I couldn’t resist the allure of the ocean any longer. With a hunger to inhale its salty breeze and bask in its refreshing embrace, I rushed towards the waves, ready to surrender myself to the soothing rhythm of the sea.
At that moment, under the azure sky, surrounded by laughter, music, and shimmering waters, I felt a profound sense of gratitude. Barcelona had unexpectedly gifted me a beautiful beach experience, and with Abdelali by my side, the day unfolded as a serendipitous tale of camaraderie and delight. The wonders of nature had worked their magic, and I couldn’t help but sigh in relief, cherishing the blissful escapade that was Barceloneta.
Abdelali and I continued our exploration of Barcelona, hopping on a bus that traversed the city’s vibrant streets. Our journey led us to two more captivating destinations — the Arena de Barcelona and the Barcelona Magic Fountain. At each location, I couldn’t help but marvel at the exuberant merrymaking, the infectious music, and the palpable joy of adventure that surrounded us.
Throughout our day together, Abdelali and I forged a deep bond, sharing laughter, stories, and a genuine sense of camaraderie. As the clock neared 8 pm, we found ourselves at the mesmerizing Barcelona Magic Fountain. The atmosphere was nothing short of enchanting, with the grand building overlooking the fountain, creating a mountain-like backdrop that added to the fountain’s allure. The music that resonated through the air had a captivating effect on Abdelali, making him hesitant to leave the scene.
However, despite the temptation to stay longer, I needed to see my Liberian “host” who had been elusive throughout the day. We made a compromise; I assured Abdelali that I would find her and catch up afterward. He understood my situation, and with a sense of excitement, we made plans to explore Barcelona’s vibrant nightlife, heading to clubs and reveling in the city’s after-dark magic.
Our shared adventure had been a rollercoaster of emotions, from the initial frustration with my “host” to the serendipitous encounter with Abdelali that led to a day filled with joy and discovery. As we set off on our respective paths for the moment, I knew that this chance encounter had added a touch of magic to my Barcelona adventure. With the promise of an exhilarating night ahead, I felt a renewed sense of anticipation, eager to embrace whatever the night had in store for us.
Dammit!
I must admit, I found myself in quite a predicament. As I bid farewell to Abdelali, my phone battery was barely holding on at a mere 1%. I felt a tinge of embarrassment, knowing that I had my charger with me but no power bank to rely on. The truth was, I had underestimated how terrible my iPhone 8’s battery life had become, simply because I spent most of my time either at school or home, where a stable electricity supply was always at hand.
Despite the low battery, I couldn’t shake the urge to meet my elusive Liberian “host.” There was an inexplicable determination within me, perhaps fueled by the need to confirm her existence or to consider this trip a resounding success. Regardless of the reason, I knew I had to see her. There was no room for giving up now.
With the address she sent me, I asked Abdelali to help me navigate using Google Maps. Together, we discovered the nearest metro station and embarked on the journey. The destination seemed distant, approximately 45 minutes away, spanning 11 metro stations, and requiring two train changes.
As I reached the final metro station, I finally managed to charge my phone and mustered the courage to call my Liberian “host.” A deep breath of relief escaped me as I spoke to her in our familiar Liberian parlance, “I am here oo, come for me na.” There was a mix of emotions swirling within me, ranging from anticipation to trepidation, as I eagerly awaited her arrival. This moment would mark the culmination of a day filled with unexpected twists and turns, making it all the more meaningful
But apparently, I had gone to a different province. The address Abdelali put on the map was the name of the address as my Liberian “ host”, but it was in the wrong province. She lived out of central Barcelona and when I checked Google Maps, it was about 1 hour by metro and 30 minutes by taxi at the cost of 35 euros. Should I visit my Liberian “host” by 11:00 PM? If yes, how?
Stuck on the train with a Chinese lady at midnight
After an intense period of brainstorming and careful consideration, lasting about 30 minutes, I finally reached a decision. I opted to take the metro, convinced that it would offer a relatively seamless journey, granted I exercised a fair amount of patience. Thus, I embarked on the one-hour metro trip to reach my elusive Liberian “host.”
As the journey commenced, I was filled with a mix of anticipation and determination. The initial phase consisted of the first two metro stops, followed by a train transfer to reach Cardanyola del Valles in the Ripollet province of Barcelona. Navigating my way to the train station posed quite the challenge, compounded by my phone’s meager 20% battery life and the time being around 11:45 PM. The streets were dimly lit, and the cold night air only added to the intensity of the situation.
Undeterred, I forged ahead, maneuvering through the darkness with a blend of courage and concern. The gravity of my determination to meet my Liberian “host” kept me going, outweighing the difficulties I faced. At this point, the journey had transformed into a personal mission — a testament to my refusal to surrender and my unwavering commitment to finally meet the person I had been seeking throughout the day.
I boarded the train to Cardanyola del Valles with a sense of immense relief. At long last, I had reached the final leg of my journey, even though I still had to walk approximately 12 minutes from the train station to my Liberian “host’s” residence. I repeatedly checked my phone, ensuring that I was on the correct train and that the timing was right. Everything seemed to be proceeding as planned until an unexpected turn of events occurred when the train abruptly stopped, just two stops away from my intended destination. The other passengers disembarked, and I couldn’t help but wonder if there were more people boarding, or if there was some other reason for the halt. However, my assumption was swiftly proven wrong when the train’s Spanish-speaking driver stepped off and exclaimed, “Estamos deteniéndonos aquí,” which translates to “We are stopping here” in English. Though my Spanish was quite rusty, I grasped the meaning of “aquí,” which meant “here.”
It was at that very moment that a surge of fear coursed through me. The time was around 12:45 AM, and after an entire night of navigating challenges to meet a fellow Liberian, I was now trapped on a stationary train. Looking outside, all I could see were bushes, and the sound of young Spaniards conversing loudly and smoking cigarettes filled the air. Inside the train, I encountered a Chinese lady who appeared shy and possessed a beauty reminiscent of my Chinese classmate, Shuwen. While I couldn’t recall her name, I distinctly remembered the flood of relief that washed over me upon seeing her. Unlike me, her English was limited, and her Spanish, much like mine, left room for serious improvement. Despite the language barrier, we managed to engage in conversation, during which she revealed that she was headed to the second-to-last stop to visit a friend.
At that moment, my sense of altruism took hold. I became more concerned about helping my newfound Chinese friend solve her predicament than I was about finding my Liberian “host.” The night had woven together a fusion of unexpected connections and challenges, revealing the shared threads of humanity that linked us all, regardless of language or origin.
About Alex, the Russian who save my life on the train tracks
After approximately 20 minutes of wandering and conversation, we spotted a train approaching. I halted, and my Chinese friend-in-adventure and I quickly boarded the train. We could not find a Spanish speaker to help us and after the first stop, my friend decided to get off the train. Outside, the night seemed even colder and darker. In the span of 30 seconds, I bombarded her with about five questions, seeking to understand her decision. It became clear that her exit wasn’t due to reaching her intended destination; rather, she appeared quite fearful. Driven by concern for her well-being and a genuine curiosity about her journey, I chose to disembark as well. The time was now around 1:00 AM. Once off the train, she explained that she needed to make this particular stop as it was en route to her destination. However, undertaking this part of her journey alone felt risky, and I pondered whether tagging along might be both a wise and foolish choice for me. I was now faced with the task of charting my own course, yet I had absolutely no clue about my whereabouts.
A few minutes later, we spotted a small group of people across the train tracks. Approaching them, we sought their assistance. As it turned out, they were all headed to the same destination as my friend-in-adventure. A train was due to arrive in just about two minutes. However, when I inquired about my own destination, they appeared to lack information. In those two minutes, I ensured my friend-in-adventure safely boarded the train and bid her farewell. By this point, it was around 1:30 AM, and I found myself alone in an unfamiliar place, my phone powerless and surrounded by the symphony of crickets and frogs. With no inkling of my next steps, I was neither exhilarated by the adventurous thrills nor paralyzed by fear for my safety. I existed in a state of numbness, yet my mind remained incredibly sharp, retaining every encounter and every detail of my intended destination. While placing my faith in God, I desperately needed a tangible guide to direct my earthly path.
After around 10 minutes of aimless contemplation under the dim, cold darkness, I spotted a figure on the other side of the train tracks. He had apparently been standing there for some time, but I hadn’t noticed until now. Swiftly, I made my way towards the man, who possessed distinct Asian features and carried a red Ghana must-go bag. Though I knew nothing about him other than his vague outline, he represented my best chance at finding my way. Upon reaching him, I initiated the conversation in English. While he didn’t respond verbally, his attentive gaze indicated he was listening. When I queried in broken Spanish, “¿Tú hablas español?” (Do you speak Spanish?), he didn’t reply verbally but signaled his inability. This encounter made it evident that he was neither fluent in English nor Spanish. I surmised that he might be from Eastern Europe or Asia, far from home like myself, wandering to his next destination.
Drawing from my limited knowledge of sign language acquired during my brief stint in the Ivory Coast and my early days in Madrid, I managed to communicate with him. Employing these rudimentary gestures, I conveyed my need to use his phone. He gave me his device, and we embarked on a conversation through Google Translate. He introduced himself as Alex, a Russian awaiting the last train that was bound for the same destination as mine. Alex was going to the final stop, and my destination, Cardanyola del Valles, was only one stop away.
Alex was the first Russian I had ever encountered, and his demeanor was as kind as Sergio’s and his willingness to help was reminiscent of Adullai’s. If Alex hadn’t been willing to engage in conversation, provide access to his phone, and offer assistance, I might have spent the night in the middle of nowhere. I might never have met my Liberian “host,” and the course of events could have taken an even more unpredictable turn.
Through a series of coincidences, connections, and the kindness of strangers, I was granted a lifeline just when I needed it most. Alex became an unwitting guardian angel, guiding me out of uncertainty and ensuring I continued my journey, determined to finally meet my Liberian “host” and unlock the mysteries that the night held.
Palm Butter at 3:00 AM
Around 2:00 AM, I arrived at Cardanyola del Valles. The early morning atmosphere was tinged with gloom and solitude. A final challenge lay ahead: a 12-minute walk to reach my Liberian “host.” As I disembarked from the train station, a faint light caught my attention in the distance. I presumed it was a shop, and with a willingness to seize any opportunity, I walked for about five minutes until I reached it. There, I intended to grab a drink and recharge my phone. The women at the shop were hospitable, providing a momentary respite. I used the opportunity to charge my phone and dialed my Liberian “host’s” number. She offered me the most quintessentially Liberian direction: “Walk straight, and as soon as you cross the bridge, turn right.”
Around 2:15 AM, while the ladies at the shop were accommodating, they were also closing for the night. Following my Liberian “host’s” instructions, I proceeded to walk straight and made a right turn after crossing the bridge. However, I couldn’t locate the street address on any of the buildings. After asking numerous strangers and continuing to walk straight while crossing the bridge, I found myself in a perplexing situation. It was then that a couple of helpful strangers informed me that I needed to cross the second bridge, which was around 5 minutes away from the first one I had crossed.
My unease was amplified by the darkness and the unpredictable behavior of some of the strangers I encountered. Observing a nearby McDonald’s, I decided to reach out to my Liberian “host” and inform her that I was unable to proceed any further. The sense of vulnerability I felt in that unfamiliar environment prompted me to prioritize my safety, especially given the hour and the unfamiliar surroundings.
I stayed at the McDonald’s, and within three minutes, I spotted my Liberian “host” walking in, accompanied by another woman. The sight of her erased the earlier feelings of anger, pain, and frustration I had experienced due to her initial inability to provide the support I had expected. In hindsight, I realized that my emotions were more about my own journey than just meeting my Liberian “host.” I felt a surge of happiness, not just because I was seeing her, but because I had refused to give up. I persisted, demonstrated resilience, and come out stronger despite the challenges.
Shortly thereafter, at around 3:00 AM, I found myself on my Liberian friend’s couch, indulging in a familiar dish from Liberia: palm butter and rice. It had been about seven months since I last enjoyed this meal, and its rich flavors and satisfying taste were a welcome treat. Sitting there, I felt a sense of belonging and comfort that I hadn’t experienced in a while. The moment was surreal — encountering a fellow Liberian, savoring a dish from my homeland, and conversing in our native Liberian parlance. No longer did I need to slow down my speech, alter my accent, or speak in standard English, nonstop. I could simply be myself, unapologetically embracing my identity and roots.
My Liberian host was nice after all
My Liberian host greeted me warmly, embracing me with open arms and a genuine sense of hospitality. She willingly shared stories of her own experiences living in Madrid, revealing the mutual connections we had. As we conversed, she emerged as someone who enjoyed a good time but was also driven by a hustling spirit. Having completed her MBA a few years back, she had chosen Spain as her home away from home, embracing it as a place of growth and opportunity.
Finally, the moment arrived when I had the chance to ride in my Liberian host friend’s car, a sleek gray Highlander. Throughout the journey, we played Liberian songs, immersing ourselves in the melodies that connected us to our roots. Eventually, they dropped me off at Hola Hostel, my Airbnb, around 4:00 AM.
The next morning, I awoke and embarked on the train back to Madrid by 1:00 PM.
My trip to Barcelona will forever hold a place as my second most cherished experience in Spain. I am grateful that I allowed myself to fully live through it and finally got the opportunity to share my story with you. I anticipate sharing this story with my grandchildren someday.
Above all, this adventure taught me the importance of proper planning, but even more significantly, it unveiled the beauty of embracing spontaneity.

The House on Tibidabo in The Shadow of the Wind
One day during our trip to Barcelona a few years ago we decided to ride all the way to the top of Mount Tibidabo, the highest hill in the city. We had to ride on three separate means of transportation to get to the top, but we did it!
First of all, we walked to the Metro station at Placa de Catalunya and boarded the brown line (L7) train which took us to the base of Avenguda Tibidabo. Then we walked across the street from the Metro exit to board the Tramvia Blau, an old streetcar line, which brought us halfway up the mountain. Finally, we transferred to the Funicular de Tibidabo to get to the top.
There at the top we found an old amusement park adjacent to a Catholic church called Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor (The Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Heart). You can see this church and some of the park’s rides from just about anywhere in Barcelona. And we soon found out that you can get one of the best views of Barcelona from the roof of this church.
In Carlos Ruiz Zafon’s masterpiece The Shadow of the Wind we follow Daniel Sempere as he traces the journey of Julian Carax (the author of a book also called The Shadow of the Wind) to the Tibidabo mansion where his love Penelope resides. Zafon himself loved to ride the tram and then the funicular to the top and gaze at the view of Barcelona. The tram opened in 1901 and the blue cars reminded me of San Francisco’s fabled cable cars. It was thrilling to consider that we may have ridden on the same car that carried both Zafon and Sempere up Tibidabo.
There are many turn-of-the-century mansions that line the slopes of Tibidabo. The most prominent is El Pinar, the home of the banker Manuel Arnus near the base of the funicular and the end of the line of the blue tram. I photographed this house after exiting the funicular on the way back down Tibidabo. I at first thought that this was Zafon’s mansion but later discovered that Zafon himself told us that the address of Torre Aldaya in The Shadow of the Wind was Avenguda Tibidabo 32, which is a few hundred meters down the hill. The building at this address is not as gothic looking like El Pinar and Zafon probably combined the appearances of several Tibidabo mansions when he imagined Torre Aldaya. The building at # 32 is now the Hotel Mirlo, a five-star boutique hotel.
El Pinar was designed by the famous architect Enric Sagnier in 1902 and the house was completed in 1904. Sagnier also designed the magnificent Sagrat Cor at the top of Tibidabo. The church’s crypt was built between 1902 and 1911 and construction of the upper church began in 1915. Sagnier’s son Josep Maria Sagnier completed the construction in 1961. The original statue of the Sacred Heart on the roof of the church was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The present statue, by Josep Miret, was completed in 1950. In this photo one of Christ’s apostles overlooks Barcelona and the huge communications tower on the next hill.
I understand the Tramvia Blau is presently closed for reconstruction. There is a bus (# 196) that now connects the Metro with the funicular.
Zafon wrote The Shadow of the Wind in 2002. It was translated into English by Lucia Graves in 2009. I came across it in early 2015 and immediately began plans for a trip to Barcelona and we flew to Spain later that year. The second book in the cycle Zafon has named The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is called The Angel’s Game. I read most of that book on the plane and finished it during our stay in Barcelona. It is a prequel to The Shadow of the Wind. I then read the third book in the cycle, The Prisoner of Heaven, shortly after returning from our trip. Lucia Graves, the excellent translator of Zafon’s Spanish works, completed the translation of The Labyrinth of the Spirits in 2019. I didn’t get around to reading it until last year. Then I reread the other three books and enjoyed them considerably. I’ll probably read all of them again someday.
Zafon was born in Barcelona in 1964 and later moved to Los Angeles where he wrote screenplays in English. But he wrote all of his fiction in Spanish. He died of cancer in 2020 at the age of 55.
Most of the actions in The Shadow of the Wind take place in the Bari Gotic and Raval neighborhoods south of Placa de Catalunya. Visitors to Barcelona can sign up for a three-hour literary walking tour that covers these areas. Tibidabo is too far away to be included in this tour, however. We didn’t take the walking tour, but we came across many of Zafon’s landmarks while following a couple of walks that Rick Steves recommends in his Pocket Barcelona.
Tibidabo gets its name from two Latin words: dabo meaning “I will give” and tibi meaning “to you.” For more info on Barcelona’s highest hill see my Crow Canyon Journal blog postings here and here. Better yet, read either an English version of the Bible or St Jerome’s translation into Latin of Matthew 4:09. And then read all four books in The Cemetery of Forgotten Books cycle for the full story of the Semperes, Daniel’s friend Fermin Romero de Torres, and that haunted mansion halfway up Mount Tibidabo.

For me, Barcelona is the city of self-awakening. After my fair share of solo traveling between London, Prague, and Paris, I can passionately say that the connection I had with Barcelona is totally unmatched. It’s the people, it’s the culture, it’s the language (Catalan), it’s the food, it’s the art, it’s every little thing that has made me fall deeply in love with this beautiful Catalan city.
In just one week’s time (or less), you too can experience all that Barcelona has to offer, from its thriving street art scene to all the local cuisines, there is plenty to see in the city that truly never sleeps.
Day 1: My experience at Camp Nou Stadium
To my surprise, I landed in Barcelona at the perfect time! It was the weekend of the La Mercè festival where many people filled the streets for four days in celebration of the Roman Catholic Feast Day of Our Lady. Many celebrations happened all over the main streets of Barcelona where there was live music, various street entertainment, food vendors, and more. Just experiencing this festival was one of the many enriching cultural experiences that I had because I witnessed how one event brought many people together from different walks of life whether they were Catholic or not (the festival is for everyone though).
The day I landed, I made it just in time for the FC Barça vs. Girona FC game which resulted in a tied game (2–2). I can now cross off “seeing Messi score live” of my bucket list :)
Even though I hardly tune into fútbol, I love a good sporting event (after all, I was a sport studies minor in college) and attending a game was just one of the many cultural experiences that I had to undergo. From the collective singing of the FC Barça’s anthem (everyone stands up for this) to hearing the crowd cheer, boo, and shout “Força Barça” it was an unforgettable experience.
Day 2: “Pay What You Can” Walking Tour of Gothic Quarters + Interactive Group Cooking Class
Barcelona is such a huge city with groovy, intimate streets that you might overlook just because you read a post on TripAdvisor about strictly going to X, Y, and Z areas. I am a huge advocate of participating in a group walking tour because it is a great way to get to know the city with the help of a resident! I discovered streets that no one else talked about in other blogs / reviews and the streets that I walked through are perfect for a impromptu photoshoot (shoutout to all the local street artists who make the city even more beautiful). Although the link that I shared above advertises as “free” at the end of all tours the guides ask for a donation because they barely get paid without our help.
And to end my Monday night, I participated in a group cooking class. If you do not mind watching the chef prep and cook the dishes, then I recommend the link above. If you are looking for a more customized cooking class where you have your own hot plate to cook paella and more, then I recommend looking elsewhere. Overall my experience with the cooking class from Viator.com was fun because I got to meet really good people from all over, share stories, and drink sangrias together. All 30 of us at this activity gathered around the large pan to help stir the paella (the interactive part), but in the future I would like to do a smaller cooking class where I can have my own cooking station and follow the instructions of the chef.
Day 3: Sagrada Família + Park Güell
I am still in awe that I got to see Antoni Gaudí ‘s exquisite work! Gaudí was a mastermind architect who designed this beautiful Basílica more than a century ago. Officials say the church is set to be completed in 2026, which is a time I will return to see even more of its beauty. Just witnessing all of the intricate details put me in a place of serenity because no matter what was going on in the world, I felt secure and had peace of mind. I spent approximately 2.5 hours inside while the average person probably only spends an hour or so.
Since I am under 30 years old, I paid 27 euros to go inside the tower, which I highly recommend. The Nativity Tower has the best view because the view faces the beach.
After visiting Sagrada Família, take a short metro ride up to another one of Gaudí works and former residence, Park Güell. Park Güell is one of the best public parks I’ve ever walked through. It has a great combination of shade and sunshine, while also being extremely green because of all the trees, bushes, and cactuses.
The majority of the park is free of charge, but to visit the Gaudí house and the Monumental Core (aka the scene of the colorful benches in Cheetah Girls 2) has a fee. The photo above doesn’t do the park justice! There are so many beautiful designs missing from this photo that you just have to see for yourself when you arrive in Barcelona.
Day 4: Exploring Barceloneta
Along with the rich history and breathtaking scenery, Barcelona is a hot beach city. Sant Sebastià Beach is one of the best parts about Barcelona because there are so many things to do from bike riding to playing a game of volleyball with new friends. At night, the beach becomes even more alive because all of the touristy nightclubs, bars, and restaurants that reside on the end of the beach, making it a perfect night out.
Day 5: City Bus Tour + Picasso Museum
I would have never thought that I would do a “hop on hop off” bus tour ever in my life. There is just so much to see in Barcelona that I gave in to this activity. One of the perks of doing the bus tour is that it comes with a coupon booklet that gives you some good deals for other activities and food places around the city. The only stop that I got off was for the Tibidabo Cathedral del Segrat Cor, which sits at the highest peak in the city, giving viewers amazing 360 views of Barcelona. After the bus tour drops you off, you have to get on the historic Tramvia Blau or 196 red bus (2 minute ride) to the base of Tibidabo, then get on the Tibidabo funicular (7 euros round trip) which is a really cool cable railroad that takes you up the mountain to the Cathedral and mini amusement park. I highly recommend coming here if you have time. The inside of the Cathedral is spectacular as well as the city view.
Since there are many museums in Barcelona, the Picasso Museum is not one to be missed. As of now, it is free entry every Thursday evening. Unfortunately once inside, no photos can be taken of the artwork *sad face* but I can tell you that witnessing the artwork of Pablo Picasso, a phenomenal 20th-century Spanish artist, was a top 5 experience. You can see the passion in all of his work despite the fact that he suffered from imposter syndrome (which is a pretty common experience) and still produced greatness. The exhibit that I witnessed at the end of September was “Picasso and food” along with Impressionist and Symbolist pieces.
If you like Mexican food, I recommend Cantina Mexicana La Hacienda restaurant, which is around the corner from Picasso Museum.
Day 6: Restaurant day around La Rambla + Passeig de Gràcia + Carrer de Blai
La Rambla is a very touristy street in the center of Barcelona that I recommend walking down very attentive of your belongings just because it’s so crowded. One thing to note about La Rambla is to never eat at any of the restaurants on this street because they are usually overpriced and not that great. I came across a fabulous restaurant that was nearby calledLa Fonda (a local resident recommended this place to me), which has a super affordable menu during the lunch hour. I had a 3 course menu for 20 euros! The food was so good that I returned a second time before my departure. The hospitality is unmatched. The host acknowledges you as soon as you walk into the establishment and you are seated right away.
Another restaurant that I recommend is Cerveceria Catalana, which serves delicious tapas! Like most cities in Europe, the best time to eat dinner is after 9pm. Since I arrived solo, I was seated right away at the bar. For groups of two or more, a wait time of one hour should be expected. After checking out all the shops on Passeig de Gràcia, come here for lunch or dinner.
Fortunately enough, my Airbnb was located right on the famous Carrer de Blai, which is a street known for its tapas restaurants. One restaurant that I highly recommend is La Tasqueta de Blai. It’s a laid back eatery that allows you to grab the tapas straight from the bar and at the end you give all your toothpicks to the waiter and pay for your food. Very affordable, each tapas is 1 euro or 1.80 euros.
Notable areas of the city: La Boqueria Market, Montjuïc Fountains at night, Plaça Reial (a nice little square that can be experienced in the afternoon or late at night) I like Kane Roomfor late night cava aka champagne.

My First Love: FC Barcelona
Love has many forms. For some, it’s a person. For others, it’s a moment, a dream, or a place. But for me, love came dressed in red and blue stripes, roaring through the TV screen, dancing on the green fields of the Camp Nou. My first love was not a person—it was FC Barcelona.
I still remember the day it all began. I was barely ten, sitting in my uncle’s living room in Nepal, surrounded by laughter and the buzz of a Champions League night. On the screen, a team moved like poetry. There was elegance, unity, magic. And right at the heart of it all was a little magician—Lionel Messi.
That match changed everything.
It wasn’t just about the goals. It was about the way Barça played. The way Xavi pulled the strings, the way Iniesta glided past defenders like a painter with a brush, the way Messi turned impossible moments into memories. It was like watching art.
From that day on, I was no longer just a boy in Nepal—I was a culé. I read articles, watched every highlight I could find, begged for a jersey with the number 10. I started waking up at 1 or 2 in the morning just to watch La Liga matches live, my eyes sleepy but my heart wide awake.
When we won, I was on top of the world. When we lost, I felt the heartbreak. Every El Clásico became a festival in my house. My room slowly turned into a shrine—posters of Ronaldinho, Messi, and Puyol, stickers of the crest, and scarves with “Més que un club” boldly written across them.
As I grew older, life became more complicated—school, pressure, reality—but Barcelona remained my constant. In the hardest moments, watching Barça play felt like coming home. It reminded me who I was, and who I wanted to be: someone who plays with heart, who stands for something, who never gives up.
I’ve never been to Camp Nou, not yet. But my dream remains. One day, I’ll walk into that stadium, feel the roar of the crowd, and finally see in person what I fell in love with all those years ago on a small TV screen in Nepal.
People ask me why I love a club so far away. I tell them it’s simple: you don’t choose your first love—your heart does. And mine chose FC Barcelona.

FC Barcelona Femení 2024/25 —what have we seen this season?,https://medium.com/@enmlowe/fc-barcelona-femen%C3%AD-2024-25-what-have-we-seen-this-season-2d6480320cf4,"Sign up

Last summer, I published an article taking a comprehensive analytical approach to FC Barcelona Femení’s 2023/24 season by discussing the principles underpinning their attacking play. When the piece was published in July, it was official that then-head coach Jonatan Giráldez would leave the club for a new challenge in the United States. Later in the summer, it was announced that Giráldez would be succeeded by his assistant, Pere Romeu. Given Romeu’s internal promotion, it was reasonable to expect minimal changes, though every coach brings their own ideas that can fully flourish under their leadership.
Over the summer, some squad changes influenced the team’s autumn dynamics: forward/attacking midfielder Mariona Caldentey left for Arsenal, and right-back Lucy Bronze returned to England to join Chelsea. At the same time, prolific striker Ewa Pajor was signed from Wolfsburg, and forward/attacking midfielder Kika Nazareth arrived from Benfica, as forward Salma Paralluelo was sidelined with an injury/playing overload.
Since the start of the season, Barcelona have been remarkably strong in the 2024/25 campaign. In the league, they currently boast 13 consecutive victories with a staggering goal difference of +50, averaging 4.38 goals per match. In the domestic competition, they convincingly defeated their only serious challenger on paper, Real Madrid, who had strengthened their squad significantly over the summer, with a 4–0 away win. However, the Champions League revealed a rare blemish: a 0–2 loss to Manchester City in the group stage opener highlighted defensive vulnerabilities that are harder to detect in league play due to the game dynamics.
Throughout the autumn, I have closely followed Barcelona and watched all their matches. This article builds on my summer analysis of the team’s attacking principles, comparing their style of play this season to last year. All video material referenced is from DAZN or SVT.
As in the summer article, we begin with a statistical review of Barcelona’s autumn to get a comprehensive picture of their season so far. Are there any differences in the data compared to last year? Does anything stand out? Data is sourced from FBref and Opta, last updated on December 16. Visualizations are courtesy of Ben Griffis’ match report site.
Offensive output
When examining offensive output, there is virtually no difference from last season. Notably, the team maintains the same level of goals per match (4.4), while averaging one more shot per match (26.4 to 27.6). Their efficiency remains consistent, with 0.16 goals per shot compared to 0.15 last season and 0.14 npxG per shot compared to 0.13. In some matches, the team’s xG has reached absurd levels; for instance, in the 10–1 win against Granada, their xG was 7.1. For perspective, the highest recorded xG in the Premier League is Liverpool’s 7.3 against Newcastle on January 1, 2024. Unfortunately, I could not find the highest recorded xG figure globally.
Passing statistics
To identify stylistic differences in the data, we can look at passing statistics. Broadly, there is no change in passing accuracy or the total number of successful passes per match (approximately 680 with 86.9% accuracy). However, there is a noticeable increase in the number of short passes per match, rising from 349 to 393, while the number of medium and long passes has decreased. This suggests closer player positioning. Additionally, there has been a decline in passes and crosses into the penalty area, as well as overall switches of play and crosses.
Possession data
Barcelona’s possession has risen to 74.6% this season compared to 71.1% last year, showcasing their dominance in controlling matches. The team’s field tilt — an indicator of territorial dominance — remains at an extraordinary 89%, a full 30 percentage points ahead of second-place Real Madrid.
A related metric, the difference between field tilt and possession, measures how much more possession a team has in the final third compared to the rest of the pitch. Barcelona leads this category with a 15-percentage-point differential, reflecting the unmatched height of their average possession. Their style of play pushes center-backs far up the pitch, underlining the gap in quality between Barcelona and their league opponents, as well as the respect and caution their opponents exhibit when facing them.
Only Lyon in France surpasses Barcelona in combined field tilt-possession metrics across Europe’s top women’s leagues, while Arsenal matches Barcelona’s levels in England. However, neither team matches Barcelona’s extreme possession and field tilt values, as their possession rates hover around 60%.
Barcelona’s Offensive and Defensive Metrics
Barcelona ranks top in every offensive and defensive possession-related category. These include passing, shooting statistics (shots and xG, both from open play and set pieces), and metrics like xT (expected threat), which measures how much a team creates danger through possession. However, there are two categories related to effciency where they do not place themselves top of the league.
Key Statistical Outliers
Efficiency and style
Despite this deliberate approach, Barcelona scores the most goals in the league by far and boasts a +7.3 goal difference above their xG, a testament to their superior finishing and decision-making. This strategy leverages the squad’s collective intelligence and ability to assess scoring opportunities. The outcome? A high-efficiency attacking style that capitalizes on possession dominance, excellent decision-making, and the technical superiority of their players.
Defensive issues exposed against Manchester City
As briefly mentioned in the introduction, Barca has one blemish on their record, when they lost 2–0 to Manchester City away in the first round of the Champions League group stage. The match was played in early October, with Barca riding a streak of five straight wins against league opposition that they had brushed aside with ease. This was thus the first real test of the season. The match exposed what could actually be called a slack or naïve approach from Barcelona to their defensive game. It demonstrated how a team playing with patience and sometimes speed in their build-up play, and daring to play threatening balls between and over the lines, could realistically challenge Barcelona. City managed to exploit a nonchalant Barcelona team that mistimed their pressing and at times didn’t even show intentions to defend against their opponents with the intensity required against a top-tier City side, featuring players like Lauren Hemp, Khadija Shaw, Vivianne Miedema, and Jess Park. Let’s look at some examples.
Here, Manchester City succeeded by exploiting three factors:
Key (creative) players at fault for this included Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guijarro, which led to others like Keira Walsh, Mapi León and Esmeé Brugts having to compensate, affecting the defensive structure and the spaces left behind in their defensive play. These points can partially be boiled down to a question of the players’ attitude toward the defensive work required but also to the team’s approach to risk aversion in their play.
Pressing in league play, and naïve buildup from opponents
In the league, they are used to taking greater risks, as they are so dominant that conceding a goal here or there due to a ball behind a high line or attackers sprinting past an undermanned rest defense doesn’t matter, since they still average 4.38 goals per match. For instance, they often dare to push their center-backs into the final third (which is the main reason they have such an extreme field tilt), and they prefer to keep their attacking forces higher up the pitch after losing the ball to maximize their impact when regaining possession, compared to a more deliberate rest-defense perspective. As a result, they’ve conceded occasional goals in league matches, having kept just six clean sheets in 13 games. However, in the Champions League opener, Barca showed no clear signs of modifying their game plan toward greater risk aversion against stronger opposition.
In the return match against Manchester City at home, they had identified the problem and approached the game out of possession much more aggressively. They chose a man-marking-based approach to their pressing, a method increasingly common in European football at the time, and implemented it right from the start. With the required intensity, they managed to completely smother City, limiting them to just three shots for a total of 0.2 xG, compared to 13 shots and 1.6 xG in the opening round. Let’s look at a clip of how this could play out.
The ever-recurring tactical question regarding the man-marking approach to defending without the ball is how long a team can sustain the required intensity when facing strong opponents with players technically skilled enough to handle such marking pressure. If you try to defend with such intensity while also maintaining a high tempo in possession, energy levels can drop quickly. Therefore, teams must either change their defensive approach later in the game by lowering the tempo and focusing more on covering spaces or slow down their own tempo in possession. In my view, this depends on the specific game plan, as the importance of certain defensive elements will largely depend on the opponent’s skill in possession.
Barca realized after the first match (although they should have seen this in the opponent analysis before the first game) that City were technically skilled enough to hurt them in their possession play. As a result, they opted for an intense approach in defending without the ball and slowed their possession tempo just enough to sustain the defensive intensity for about 80 minutes, which was sufficient. They returned to their “normal” levels of 74% possession and, in this match, 850 passes, where short passing sequences after ball recoveries were key to calming the tempo and gaining the control of the match they never had in Manchester. Leading 3–0 with ten minutes left, they slowed the pace somewhat, where two of City’s three shots came in the last ten minutes. In this match, they were thus skilled in the crucial tactical balance of tempo.
In the league, we often see teams trying to play out from the goalkeeper in their build-up. In this phase of pressing, Barca usually shows great discipline (it’s sometimes in certain transitional moments defensively that certain players may lack this) and are very skilled at shutting down their opponents with a form of hybrid press, which I consider more marking-oriented but still with elements of players in hybrid roles. We see an example in the match against Real Betis.
After watching several Liga F matches where the same patterns can be discerned match after match — where Barcelona’s opponents attempt to build from the goalkeeper but are quickly stopped, leading to a rather destructive effect in transitions — I am increasingly struggling to understand why opponents’ game plans continue to emphasize this approach. Even if it aligns with their principles, I still find it difficult to grasp why opponents persist in this way when it so often actively works against them when facing Barcelona.
The conclusion from my first article about Barcelona was that I viewed them as a team that values principles over structures. In the final section of the article, I reflected on how these principles borrow elements primarily associated with positional play but also principles tied to discussions around relational play. Most principles from last season remain intact, although some have evolved further. An example is evident in the statistics showing an increase in shorter passes, a consequence of closer player proximity. Barcelona often overload the left side in what, in relational play terminology, is frequently referred to as a “tilt.” You’ll often see a “right-back” like Ona Batlle coming centrally into the pitch, with “six” Keira Walsh moving wide to join her teammates, and winger Caroline Graham Hansen typically maintaining width — a feature they value for creating an outlet.
However, just because a team plays with a clear tilt doesn’t mean it adheres to “relational play.” A team fully embracing relational principles works clearly with inside diagonals and concepts like tabelas, escadinhas, and corta luz. When these movement-based principles aren’t utilized — either due to limited understanding among players of each other’s movements and intentions or because a coach doesn’t sufficiently encourage them — such overloads can become static and ineffective. Defending teams can then fairly easily contain attacks in their defensive third without conceding threatening shots.
How can a tilt look?
In the clip below, we see a relatively static tilt on the left side. However, note in particular how the players position themselves relative to the (fairly small) spaces created on that side but at angles that allow them to receive passes and maintain progression. They constantly adapt to spaces created in the opponent’s defensive structure.
We also see an example of an attack in the final third through an inside diagonal.
In these moments of attacking play, Barcelona have successfully combined forward movements out of a tilt with varying effectiveness depending on the match. How well this works largely depends on which players are on the pitch and who participates in the tilt.
In a video analysis of Barcelona’s men’s team by the YouTube channel The Purist, three qualities were identified in players that make their attacking play so threatening:
A Master at Delivering to Space, a Creative Combination Player, and a Game Breaker
When Alexia Putellas was absent from the team during a period from late November to mid-December, her decisive role as a creative combination player became evident. This was especially noticeable in the league match against Valencia. She served as a crucial link in the left-side tilt, making short-passing sequences effective in breaking down defensive structures by doing what defenders seldom expected. Together with Aitana Bonmatí, they form a sharp and unpredictable duo capable of creative combinations. Alexia often initiates the unpredictable action — whether it’s a backheel, a no-look pass, or participating in a tabela — while Aitana interprets it by either attacking the space where the ball lands or extending the play to the next player in a threatening position.
We see this in the clip below, where Claudia Pina receives the ball from Alexia, and Aitana finishes.
This isn’t to say other players cannot combine creatively, but based on watching Barcelona with and without Alexia, I’ve observed that these combinations emerge more naturally with her as the link. In many other cases, it has taken several attempts before players fully understood each other’s intentions.
Here’s an example where left-sided winger Esmeé Brugts looks to play a one-two but Aitana doesn’t grasp her intent.
Later, we see another instance where the situation is right, and Patri understands what Brugts wants to do. Shortly after, Claudia Pina breaks the deadlock in the match.
Something else that characterizes Barcelona is how frequently they use inside diagonals to attack the box, much like The Purist highlighted in their analysis of the men’s team’s approach in the final third. In many matches, Barcelona rarely appears restricted by a structure or framework-based ideas when attacking the box.
A significant advantage Barcelona gains when executing a tilt is the opposition’s need to respond to the overload, the rotations and movements within it. As noted earlier, Keira Walsh, playing as a “six,” is often directly involved in a tilt rather than serving as a traditional central balance player when attacking the penalty area. If Walsh draws a defender, it allows Barcelona’s opposite “ten,” who is usually positioned more centrally but can shift outward if an outlet is needed, to almost always be free for a switch of play. Walsh also enjoys rotating with her midfield colleagues, who in turn attack the space she vacates. This forces the opponents to shift further if they want to keep up. In this way, Barcelona can confuse defending teams, who suddenly don’t know whom to press.
A clear example of this can be seen in a clip where Walsh (#21) makes a run into an open space on the right side. Manchester City’s Yui Hasegawa (#25), initially responsible for Aitana Bonmatí (#14), must now contend with both Walsh and Aitana. Hasegawa eventually tracks Walsh, leaving Aitana free to receive the ball and play it forward. Barcelona then breaks the press with successive third-player combinations, culminating in Patri finding the perfect angle and delivering a sublime cross-field pass to Salma Paralluelo.
Since Barcelona’s tilt often occurs on the left side, switches of play frequently target the right side. And on that side, we find Barcelona’s most prominent “game breaker” — Caroline Graham Hansen. Her ability to challenge defenders one-on-one, both inside and outside, makes her a formidable weapon. Leading the Spanish league in expected assists (xA) and shot assists, she is crucial to Barcelona’s offensive dynamism. Even in matches where Barcelona slows the tempo with the ball, Graham Hansen can suddenly break away from her marker, drive into the box, and deliver a ball into the most dangerous areas.
We’ve discussed how Barcelona often utilizes tilts in the final third, diagonal attacks into the penalty area through penetrating passes, and creative combinations when the “right” players understand each other. These are examples of relational tendencies in their attacking play. However, when it comes to buildup play — or what might more accurately be called possession establishment — things can look different. In league play, “buildup” from the goalkeeper or deep in the defensive line rarely occurs, as opponents seldom choose to press Barcelona. They know that Barcelona’s players are too technically skilled; any minor error in the press will allow them to bypass it in an instant. Instead, opponents often adopt a compact shape as soon as they lose the ball.
Last season, we saw a Barcelona side that frequently resolved such situations in diverse ways depending on the game’s immediate state, but with clear principles like third-player combinations and overloads in tight spaces — even in their own half. Interesting tactics included forwards dropping deep (as Mariona Caldentey often did), rotations that drew defenders and opened spaces for diagonal progression during the establishment phase, and movements that seemed to create artificial transitions in the game.
In another article, I attempted to define a concept for what Barcelona executed in this part of their play, which I called adaptationism. The term was used to describe how teams use principles to continuously adapt to the game’s immediate state, considering space, ball position, and the positions of opponents and teammates. This occurs regardless of whether one adheres to relational, positional, or a hybrid approach — or perhaps none of these at all.
Barcelona’s evolving possession “structures”
This season, Pere Romeu has chosen to implement clearer structures during the establishment phase in certain matches. This could partly be due to Romeu’s autonomy as a coach but also due to the specific player resources available to him. One notable example is Mapi León, who returned from an injury spell last year and has become the team’s top performer in passes into the final third and progressive passes. León often operates from an advanced position as a left center-back, with Irene Paredes covering behind her. With León’s exceptional passing ability, Barcelona have been able to deploy other players in more advanced roles during attacks.
For instance, Claudia Pina has played much more as a forward this season than last, where she primarily served as a central midfielder. Pina is a player who often doesn’t get the credit she deserves, overshadowed by her high-profile teammates. Statistically, she ranked higher than both Aitana Bonmatí and Patri Guijarro last season, even as Alexia Putellas was out injured during certain periods. Pina also had the most minutes on the pitch last year and is equally indispensable this season.
In one clip, we see Barcelona patiently lure the opponent’s midfield into pressing by baiting them. When they bite, space opens up, allowing Pina to attack it and flick the ball forward to striker Ewa Pajor. Simultaneously, Aitana Bonmatí recognizes the situation and makes a decisive run, setting herself up for a clear scoring opportunity that she later converts.
Structural variations in the establishment phase
During the establishment phase, Barcelona frequently employs the 3–2–5 structure commonly associated with positional play. Occasionally, they use what resembles a three-back formation with a “six” operating fluidly just above, while the “rest” of the team positions themselves slightly further upfield. While this might look like a 3–1–6 numerically, it doesn’t entirely reflect the practical dynamics on the pitch.
In one sequence, Barcelona demonstrates patience, waiting to see if Manchester City will press their central double pivot. However, City opts for a compact shape to block central progression. This narrow defensive setup leaves more space and time for Barcelona to exploit the flanks and maintain their attacking momentum. Mapi León’s progressive passing comes to the fore, as does Esmeé Brugts’ deep ball to Ewa Pajor.
In another example, Barcelona plays with a three-back setup and a “six” during possession establishment, positioning players between the opposition’s defensive lines to disrupt a compact 4–4–2 or 5–3–2. Initially, patience in the backline is key. Then comes horizontal stretching of the defense, followed by a switch of play to create larger spaces on the opposite side. Barcelona advances through shorter passes and carries, culminating in another switch of play. Notably, Aitana continues her run into the assist zone, accompanied by multiple players attacking the penalty area.
Blending football philosophies
These examples illustrate how Barcelona employs principles from various football philosophies in different phases of their attacking play:
Barcelona’s rotations are not confined to a predefined structure but rather aim to influence both their own shape and the opponent’s defensive organization. This interplay of ideas from multiple football ideologies makes it difficult to assign a single philosophical label to the team.
FC Barcelona Femení as a Case Study
The blending of concepts from different football philosophies and their interaction within individual matches — as well as forming the foundation of an entire team strategy — is a fascinating subject. In this regard, FC Barcelona Femení serves as an intriguing case study. Their tactical versatility and innovative approach challenge conventional categorizations, making them a standout example of modern football’s evolving complexity.

A few days before my big move to Barcelona, I found myself talking to my now ex-colleague, Jesús. It was late at night, and we were on the Gatwick Express, heading into Victoria on our way back from the Polyglot Conference in Slovenia. Jesús is from Valencia, and so he took a particular interest in my decision to move to Spain. He asked me if I already had any friends in Barcelona.
“Yes,” I said, quickly. “Lots of friends. So many people, from all over the world. I know all of them.” There was a pause, which I interrupted to re-emphasise: “I have lots of friends.”
“OK,” Jesús replied, cautiously. “Just that I know you know lots of people, but just in case you need anything, my sister’s been living in Barcelona for years now, and she lives very close to where you’re going to be, so if you ever need anything just give her a call.”
I was taken aback. Not only was this so incredibly kind and thoughtful of Jesús to suggest, but the reality is that whenever you move to a new country, you never really know as many people as you think. There are fleeting connections that come and go, occasional numbers exchanged at meet-up groups, people you get on with who then mysteriously leave the country without saying a word… Knowing somebody who actually lived there, permanently, and was from there was like finding water in the desert. I graciously accepted.
The next day, a TV crew from the Catalan News Station TV3 had come to find me at work in London and shoot a short interview about why I was moving to Barcelona. When I met them at reception, the journalist greeted me in Catalan. I then turned to greet the cameraman in Catalan too. He turned out to be from Madrid, and although he understood Catalan, he said he didn’t really speak it because, well, he was Spanish.
The journalist, Sergi Mulero, then told me that actually, although he was Catalan, he came from a Spanish speaking family in Catalunya as well. He’d learned Catalan at school and grew up bilingually, but actually, his first language was Spanish. That was that. We spent the rest of the morning speaking just Spanish.
The day I arrived in Barcelona, the main Catalan TV channel had been playing that report on repeat pretty much all day. When I logged into Twitter, I found hundreds of messages from people all across Catalunya welcoming me, thanking me for choosing them, and wishing me all the best.
That evening, I got a WhatsApp. It was Jesús. “My sister and her family have been watching you all day on Catalan TV, and they want to invite you to join them for lunch,” he said.
I got in touch with Jesús’s sister, Maria, and we messaged in Spanish and arranged to meet that Saturday at 2pm — lunchtime in Spain — by the newly refurbished Mercat Sant Antoni.
Needless to say, I got totally lost. After 20 minutes of walking in circles around the outside of the gigantic, €80 million crucifix that was the Mercant Sant Antoni, I received a phone call. It was Maria, asking where I was. I explained I had no idea, but that I was by one of the entrances. Eventually we found each other, and walked to the restaurant to meet her, her husband, their daughter and her godfather. After we finished greeting each other, Maria asked a question that nobody would ever ask in London.
“Pues ¿qué idioma vamos a hablar? So what language are we going to speak?”
I was taken aback. Weren’t we already speaking a language? Wasn’t it already decided? Every centimetre of my body began to fill with fear that they were going to ask me to speak English to them. How many times had that happened to me when living abroad? How many friendships had I started that turned out to just be glorified free English lessons? I groaned.
“Bueno, es que el idioma de nosotros es el catalán,” she explained while my head exploded. “Cuando salimos a comer los sábados, siempre hablamos en catalán. It’s just that our language is Catalan. When we go out to eat on Saturdays, we always speak in Catalan.”
My head was exploding for lots of reasons. The first, was that I knew Maria was from Valencia. When I lived in Valencia, I remembered distinctly that Catalan (or Valencian, as it’s known there) was always the elephant in every room. Everything — all street signs, all addresses, bus timetables, etc. — was always written in valencià, but nobody really spoke it. I remembered so clearly when I went to the town hall to register my existence in Spain, asking the civil servant behind the desk whether she spoke any Valencian.
“Nos obligan a aprenderlo en el colegio, pero… They force us to learn it at school, but…” she leaned closer, to whisper: “Nadie lo habla aquí. Ni palabra. Nobody speaks it here. Not even a word.”
The other reason was that I knew that although Jesús was very proud of Catalan and had done most of his school in it, he tended to speak Spanish. I’d just assumed that, like the presenter from TV3, he came from a Spanish speaking family.
“Si, és molt estrany. Yes, it’s very strange,” Maria said, switching to Catalan when I asked her about this. “En Jesús era sempre el meu germà castellanoparlant. Tots parlàvem català, i ell sempre contestava en castellà. Jesus was always my Spanish-speaking brother. We all spoke Catalan, and he always answered in Spanish.”
I told them that I loved Catalan, that I thought it was the most beautiful of all the Romance languages, the missing piece of the puzzle between Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese. But I apologised, explaining that although I wanted to learn more Catalan, I had just arrived and my spoken Catalan was weak. I asked them to please continue speaking Catalan as though I weren’t there, but that I would feel more comfortable expressing myself in Spanish.
Of course it was no problem, but as the conversation went on, everyone by default shifted into speaking Spanish. I felt terrible. I felt like that one annoying person at a group of internationals in Berlin who all spoke German but who kept saying “Could we just speak English please so everybody understands?” Forcing people to use a major world language instead of their beautiful ‘minority’ language so they could speak to me was certainly nowhere to be found on my list of things to do when I moved to Catalunya. Yet I’d just arrived, and that’s exactly what I was doing.
It was so lovely to meet Maria and her friends and family, and I really couldn’t have imagined a nicer way to start my new life in Barcelona. I had sudden flashback half way through to last time, when I was living in Valencia, and I used to go out to restaurants on a Saturday for lunch that were always packed full with huge tables of Spanish families and friends eating, drinking, talking and enjoying. I’d always observe them from the tiny table they’d put me on in the corner, thinking that I would never feel the same connection to this beautiful place that they did. I would always be an outsider, a permanent tourist, a guiri. Those thoughts are partly what took me back to the UK, convinced that really you had to live in your own country to be happy. Yet three years later, here I was sitting at the table, chatting away in Spanish and dishing out huge plates of arroz negro.
Yet I felt so bad about forcing everyone to speak Spanish, that I made a pact with myself. From now on, I was only going to use Catalan. Everywhere, and with everyone. Why not? After all, all the signs everywhere were almost always just in Catalan. In most cafés and restaurants you had to play this weird game where you’d decide what you want by reading the menu in Catalan, then translate it back into Spanish so that you could order it from the waiter. Why not make life easier for everyone and just speak Catalan to everyone instead?
Well, almost everyone that is.
Armed with my new Catalanophile confidence, my first target was the new Tim Hortons that had opened up near my house. I’d never heard of Tim Hortons, but apparently it was the place to go in Canada, which is why it made total sense for it to open just off Plaça de Catalunya in Barcelona, where, once again, every single word inside it from the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ signs on the doors to the list of coffees was written in Catalan.
I awaited my turn, and eventually was served.
“Hola, ¿qué te pongo? Hey, what can I get you?” I was asked, in Spanish.
“Bona tarda,” I replied proudly, in Catalan. “Em dones un cafè negre sisplau, i un donut de dolç de llet. Could I get a black coffee please and a dulce de leche donut.”
There was a silence. I had been concentrating so hard on remembering how to say dulce de leche in Catalan that I’d made the whole order focusing on the display case, without looking up. Clearly I had made some horrendous grammar mistake. Clearly I had used some kind of Castillian Spanish word. Something had happened. Something had gone wrong.
Eventually I looked up. As my eyes made their way up to meet dark circles of the man behind the till, they passed over a name badge.
First I saw the name ‘Eduardo’. Then I saw the Colombian flag next to it.
“Oh shit,” I thought.
“Molt bé,” he answered in perfect Catalan with the most beautiful Colombian accent. “És per aquí o per emportar? Is that to have here or take away?”

Barcelona conquered my heart 12 years ago. Since then I have known no other city that enchants me so much. She keeps her memories in the Gothic Quarter and Old Town, and exquisitely dresses up in the architecture of the Eixample.
I recall the words of one taxi driver in Valencia who, with a sigh of complaint, noted that his native city turned its back on the sea, while Barcelona faces the sea flirtatiously. Those who have been there can see the driver’s point.
Indeed, Barcelona was born under a lucky star. It started its growth from the seashore and developed as a port city. The sea predetermined not only its urban development, but also the spirit of Ciudad Condal — a free city, the seat of a county unto itself. It is artistic, independent and constantly changing.
Barcelona consistently irritated Francisco Franco, who espoused centralism and linguistic unification. The burden of dictatorship that constrained Catalan cultural self-identification and sidelined their ancestors’ language amounted to a straitjacket on Catalan identity. Once free, Catalonia erupted in national pride, gained autonomy and enacted widespread use of the Catalan language. Today, picking out a book in Spanish (Castellano) in a Barcelona bookstore can become a dizzying challenge for the eyes.
If you’ve been to Barcelona, you can’t fail to notice red-and-yellow Catalan flags hanging from some balconies, or black stickers with a donkey adjusted to a car bumper. These are the signs of Catalan self-identification. A driver from Madrid, on the other hand, would festoon his car with a sticker of an Osborne bull. This is the animal that witnessed a passionate coitus between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in the explicit movie Jamón, Jamón.
The relationship between Madrid and Barcelona reminds me of the relationship between Moscow and St Petersburg. There is an intrinsic rivalry between the two cities, which can be compared in terms of size, grandeur and cultural imprint.
Still, in my mind’s eye there is no place for competition between Madrid and Barcelona because I tend to view them as cities of the opposite sex. Barcelona sounds like a woman’s name and its architectural lines embody femininity; whereas Madrid manifests itself as a king and has a male energy. Would it not be laughable for a man and a woman to compare assets?
However, nobody would deny that it was not Madrid, but Barcelona that in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was a wellspring of artistic, bohemian and eccentric lifestyle in Spain. The Catalan capital was greatly influenced by Paris. In 1989 the Parallel avenue became famous for its own Moulin Rouge, the El Molino music hall. Another Parisian-like venue was a famous café, Els Cuatre Gats at carrer Montsió 3. It was opened by Pere Romeo, who had previously worked as a waiter and an entertainer in the cabaret Le Chat Noir in Paris. He timely sensed that Barcelona was lacking a tavern with affordably priced food and sounds of a piano. This place was bound to become legendary. The upper crust of the artistic world, namely Santiago Rusiñol, Ramón Casas, Pablo Picasso and Antonio Gaudí held their vibrant round tables there.
Els Cuatre Gats is still up and running. If you are willing to travel back to the early 20th century and see a place where creative ideas were born, you should definitely pin this café on your map.
To help you understand what makes me feel enchanted by Barcelona, I would like to share some of my favourite routes and spots. In my recommendations I will deliberately skip some of the most revered tourist locations.
To start with, I must confess that I loathe La Rambla. The reason is simple. It is overcrowded and has a precarious feel. If you are up for a long straight walk, instead of going down La Rambla toward the sea, turn around and head up the Rambla de Cataluña. This long boulevard is wrongly ignored by the touristic herds, who prefer to ransack numerous shops on Paseo de Gracia rather than peacefully explore the streets inhabited by genuine Catalans. You can see the essence of Barcelona life along the Rambla de Cataluña. There are families with strollers passing by, senior gray-haired couples sitting on the benches, loud groups of friends drinking cañas or eating tapas in the street cafes.
Merging with locals doesn’t exclude the opportunity to do some shopping. Don’t miss Muji, Jo Malone or Zara Home. But the foremost highlight of this boulevard is the elegant architecture of the buildings. Be ready to have a sore neck as you will constantly feel the need to look upward. Soon enough, your long walk will be rewarded with an imposing view of Tibidabo mountain. This name comes from the Latin, meaning “I will give to you”. These were the words that the Devil said to Jesus Christ, trying to tempt Him in the desert with all the riches of the world — and what greater riches could there be, one should think, than the seducing skyline of Barcelona?
Our Savior turned down the diabolical offering. But we, trespassers and sinners, should not refrain from enjoying the breathtaking view of the city. And we should also visit the Temple of the Sacred Heart atop Tibidabo, crowned with a monumental figure of Jesus Christ.
Due to its distance from the city center, Tibidabo is not considered as a main attraction. But I would strongly recommend you to take a bus or a taxi and see the beauty of Barcelona from here, almost from Heaven. I will concede, of course, that Sagrada Familia is a masterpiece beyond human conception, where you will witness a triumph of life, but here in the Temple of the Sacred Heart you will get all that plus a unique feeling of hovering over the city.
In order to feel Barcelona’s heart beating, one should go to Diagonal. Despite its proximity to Paseo de Gracia, this long and important artery is almost free from tourists. Instead of casually dressed foreigners you will see business-like, formally dressed Catalans, who hurriedly park their Vespas along the road and rush to their offices.
As a driver, I prefer to avoid this avenue because of the traffic and frequency of traffic lights, but as a pedestrian, I value this street a lot. I love its architectural attire: the splendid façades and ascending perpendicular streets, Muntaner and Aribau, which lead to Vía Augusta. These streets shape one of the city’s most affluent neighborhoods — Sant Gervasi. Its residents are doctors, professors, lawyers and businessmen. You can see them during their morning walks with their dogs in the tiny lovely Parc Turó or in the nearby cafes enjoying a café cortado or café solo and reading El Periódico on the weekends.
If you are hungry and tempted to try traditional tapas, I know a place that you would like. Cervercería Catalana reflects the easygoing nature of Barcelona — it takes good care of its visitors, but not at the expense of the locals, so be ready to rub elbows with the white collars who come here for lunch. If you choose to munch between 13.30 and 15, you will have to wait for approx. 15 minutes to be seated. But if you come alone, don’t miss the chance to get a place at the bar. Apart from the so-much-talked-about tapas you will face an abundance of fresh seafood and seasonal vegetables on the counter. Don’t be shy, point your finger at whatever raw ingredient you find attractive and in 5–10 minutes you will have it, cooked in the Spanish way. Take advantage of the menu of the day. During the weekdays it includes rice of the day (arroz del día). If you come in good company, bear in mind the Spanish tradition of sharing food, when all the plates with different tapas are placed in the middle of the table. This custom (para compartir) is not only generous but also very useful, as you are allowed to indulge in a symphony of various flavours.
Speaking of tapas, here is an interesting fact. Nowadays it is not a common sight, but 10 years ago you could rate the quality of a bar by the quantity of crumpled napkins thrown under the bar counter. Imagine yourself drinking a glass of wine or a pint of beer, savouring morsels of tapas, wiping your fingers with napkins and throwing them down. For a passerby, a floor covered with paper would be the best advertising campaign.
In tapas bars I prefer to skip the deserts and treat myself to un carajillo con Baileys — a small glass of coffee with Bailey’s Irish Cream. Let me end Part I on that sweet note…

Originally published on alexrawlings.co.uk
It was a very simple move. A short, 90 minute hop across the length of France, down over the Pyrenees, and into my new home. Into Barcelona.
I had tried to throw almost everything away. I’d spent the week before the big day hauling huge bags of old clothes, books, unused kitchen equipment and anything that could weigh me down out to the recycling centre. I’d narrowed my life down to just two suitcases and the iMac I’d bought in Budapest. That was everything I packed onto that small plane that morning and brought with me into my new life.
There was nobody to greet me as I walked out of arrivals pushing my trolley. A sea of strangers, waiting for friends and relatives. I walked past them, pushing my life on a single trolley, and headed for the taxi rank.
I made my way to the front of the queue and greeted the taxi driver in Spanish.
“Hola, buenas.” I pointed at my bags. “Te pido disculpas, porque llevo toda mi vida aquí, y tendremos que ponerla toda en tu coche. You’ll have to forgive me, because I have my whole life with me here, and we’re going to have to fit all of it in your taxi.”
“Buenas,” he replied. “Eso es toda tu vida? Qué guay. Qué honor. Pues la ponemos por detrás. This is your whole life? Wow. What an honour. Let’s put it all in the boot.”
We drove off along the motorway towards the city over the turquoise horizon. The taxi driver was keen to talk. He asked me if I had so many things with me because I was moving to Barcelona. I told him I was. He asked me what I was going to do here. I coughed.
This was the question that I’d spent so long trying to avoid answering. The fact was I didn’t really have a clear idea. I had dreams, I had some plans, I had some projects, and I’d come to Barcelona because I thought this would finally be the place where I could get to work on them.
Because how do you tell somebody that one day you just woke up and knew you had to go? That you went into work and sat down with your manager and gave her your notice? You put your room up for rent, closed your bank accounts, and booked a one way ticket. Then a few weeks later, you just went.
No, you didn’t know what you were going to. But you knew that you’d never felt any urge as strong as this ever before in your life, and so for the very first time you stopped listening to everybody else, and started listening to yourself. And because you’d done that, you knew everything would be alright.
“I’m a journalist,” I told him. “I write feature pieces about languages, cultures and intercultural communication.” That’s what I’d told the BA cabin crew at Heathrow that morning when I was trying to persuade them to let me take my iMac into the cabin with me. It had worked.
The driver wasn’t really interested, because what he really wanted to talk about was chestnuts. Chestnuts, he told me, were an important symbol for life. They reconnected us with nature, with fate, and they brought us luck.
He grew chestnuts, he told me, but not just any chestnuts, lucky chestnuts: castañas de la suerte. He told me that whenever I needed some luck or inspiration, I should just take one of his chestnuts into my hand and squeeze it tight, and that fate would smile upon me.
As he started listing all the Spanish celebrities I’d never heard of who’d been in his taxi and held his chestnuts, I thought that was exactly what I needed at this point in my life: a bit of luck.
I looked at his measly chestnuts in their cheap cardboard boxes. I knew it was a scam, but I decided I was going to buy one anyway.
Soon, the motorway gave way to the elegant, multicoloured avenues of Barcelona. The billboards that had been offering to fly me back to London for €19,99 had turned into wrought iron balconies, draped with Catalan independence flags and yellow ribbons.
The afternoon sun began to dance through the autumnal leaves of the trees that lined the street. I suddenly realised that the driver had stopped talking about chestnuts.
“I’m very Catalan,” he said. “I love my country, I love my language, and I love my people.” As we drew up to a red light, he turned around to face me. “Pero yo no me muero por ninguna bandera. But I’m not going to die for any flag.” He let that hang for a moment in the air.
The lights turned green and we drove on, past another sea of Catalan flags. Each one seemed bigger, longer, and stripier than the last.
I told him, in Catalan, that I wanted to learn better Catalan. This delighted him, and he immediately stopped speaking Spanish.
“Everyone who lives in Barcelona should learn Catalan”, he told me. “Everyone complains that Catalans are very reclusive and hard to get to know, but how on earth do people coming here expect to integrate if they won’t even learn our language?”
“Lots of foreigners come here to learn Spanish and then complain that everything is written in our language. There are so many cities in the world that speak Spanish, and just one that speaks Catalan. Why do they come here? If they don’t like it here, why don’t they go to Toledo or Valladolid or somewhere else?”
Because they don’t really come here to learn Spanish or Catalan, I thought. They come here primarily for the beach. There’s no beach in Toledo.
Eventually we arrived. My new front door was a gigantic glass and iron structure that gushed with natural light from the busy street into the ornate entranceway of my building.
I told the driver I wanted to buy a chestnut. His face looked like Catalunya had just been given independence and granted a permanent seat on the UN Security Council all in the same afternoon.
He helped me lift my possessions out onto the street, and plonked my largest suitcase directly into the path of a passing hipster with perfect designer stubble. He stumbled over it. “Welcome, tourist,” he muttered in English.
I started looking for the right doorbell to ring when suddenly the door was opened by a tall, thin guy with curly black hair and an Argentinian accent. I realised this was the person who was in the process of moving out of the room I was moving into. He had some bad news.
“El ascensor no va. Tendrás que subir las escaleras. The lift is out. You’re going to have to take the stairs.”
It was almost a very simple move. But even the slog of lifting 65 kilos worth of possessions up five flights of stairs was made beautiful by the ornate tiles that lined every step of the way.
As I collapsed into the sofa of my new living room and enjoyed the final rays of sunlight of the afternoon streaming through the double balcony doors, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I had done it. I live in Barcelona now. And I couldn’t be happier.

This note is part of my travel series, Giant Leaps: a collection of my experiences from across the globe. You can view all of my trips on here.
Find me on Twitter. Thanks for reading!
Visiting the iconic city of Barcelona has always been a long-standing item on my bucket-list. I am not exactly sure which aspect of the city I was most excited about…perhaps it was the culture. I have always been excited by what looked like incredible food, vibrant nightlife, and extremely passionate people. And, of course, there was the soccer.
I made a special effort to visit Barcelona, en route to Asia, and was lucky enough to spend eight days in the heart of the city (big thanks to my friends who let me crash on their couch).
My first impression of the city came from above. Literally.
Flying in (via London), I immediately recognized Barcelona’s impressively mapped out urban design. Spacious, walkable roads are snaked across a grid, encouraging walking and biking throughout the city.
Cerda’s l’Eixample (Expansion) plan made walking enjoyable almost everywhere — 50 percent of all street space is dedicated to walking space, with the other 50 percent for all other forms of ‘traffic.’ — CityLab
Architecture, as I quickly learned, was an important aspect of Barcelona culture. Their buildings blended art and science. Brilliant curves and mathematical lines came together. Funky shapes and simple circles lined buildings in magical ways. That was Barcelona.
Five years ago, when I moved to Sant Antoni, a neighborhood in the Eixample district (pronounced ‘eshampla’), I was overwhelmed by the endless blocks and blocks of buildings. And on each block, everything looked the same — fruit stands, bakeries, supermarkets, banks, then more fruit stands, more bakeries, more supermarkets and more banks… — Guide
But why? And how? How was the city architected in such a way to provide consistency and accessibility to its urban population?
The godfather of Eixample’s city grid is urban planner Ildefons Cerdà. He believed in healthy everyday living through basic needs — among those are sunlight, ventilation, greenery, and ease of movement.
The uniformity and continuity of squares was designed to eliminate segregation of all neighborhoods. Cerdà believed in sanitary conditions for all social classes.
(This did not completely work, as much of the city suffers from income inequality and rising home prices).
Another interesting thing I had never seen prior to coming to Barcelona was the “chamfered street-corners.”
These were designed in such a way to make traffic move more fluidly while still giving walkers a place to move. There are other interesting phenomenon, further outlined in this article, about Barcelona’s unique design characteristics, like how “all blocks are oriented northwest-southwest for maximum solar access,” or how the buildings were “supposed to be as tall as 16 meters in height as to not block the sunlight for other buildings.”
As I experienced, much of Barcelona’s beauty is non-obvious: subtle splashes of math interwoven in the art.
In roughly a week, I was able to see a great deal of the city and truly immerse myself in what I now come to see as “Barcelona culture” — a mix of going out until 6 in the morning, eating tapas, and admiring the brilliant architecture.
La Sagrada Familia is perhaps Barcelona’s most well-known tourist attraction. The unfinished Roman Catholic church, famously designed by Gaudi, is truly an extraordinary sight. “It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026 — the centenary of Gaudí’s death.”
Like many districts of the city, the area surrounding La Sagrada has tons of small restaurants and bars to sit at and admire the site.
I saw the Arc both during the day and at night. It was built, by architect Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas, as the main access gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. It is definitely worth a quick visit.
The Montjuic Castle sits atop one of Barcelona’s many hills. It is an old military fortress, with an interestingly troubled past, as it was overrun by the Nazis. The view from the top is great, and I recommend taking the tram up.
Growing up both playing and watching, I have always had a keen interest for soccer. Regardless of your passion for the sport, Camp Nou is a sight to be seen. It is the largest stadium in Europe (second largest in the world) and home to centuries of sports’ history. Unfortunately, my visit did not overlap with an opportunity to see a game in action…but I imagined it…
Barceloneta, a seaside neighborhood, is perhaps my favorite part of the city. The beach is lined with dozens of traditional restaurants and bars. All of the best clubs (which are in my mind some of the best in the world) are lined right along the boardwalk. We spent many late nights (and early mornings) in in this area at Opium, Shoko, Pacha, to name a few…
I wish I had more specific recommendations/names, but, in general much of the food across Barcelona is the same: Tapas. Tapas are small appetizer-like items that vary in style/cuisine. My favorites were Patatas Bravas and spicy peppers. We also had great western foods. Bar-wise, we had a lot of fun at George Payne and the Stock Exchange Bar.
In general, Barcelona completely lived up to (and surpassed) many of my expectations. The nightlife scene is really amazing and the people you meet throughout the city are friendly and willing to help you get around.
The city-system is fairly easy to navigate, as there is an intuitive metro system that can take you pretty much anywhere for fairly cheap.
One interesting anecdote, in recollecting on the experience, is just how laid back the culture is there. Perhaps my gut takeaway is that Spanish people, much like Italians and Greek, live for the day — not the year, decade etc. Future planning, in my limited conversations with locals, did not seem to be the big priority (as it feels like it is in the US). This is obviously a generalization, one rooted in a biased sample size, but, nonetheless, I found immersing myself in the “relaxing” environment of Spain to be a fresh injection of culture and presence — to live life, and nothing more (or less).

From a small town of Jharkhand to an international tourist spot, home of “FC Barcelona”. A Solo travel to foreign land to end up meeting lovely people and finding soul brothers. It was an amazing time that I spent in Spain. Hence to give my respect and acknowledgment to everyone who was part of my travel is my responsibility, hence I am writing this article.
This was an important event in my life as I had always wanted that my first international travel would have some meaning to it and not just a recreational event. Hence, I was thrilled when I first new about the travel. My wife can tell you about the excitement I had the day I told her.
I am breaking this article in following parts.
Requesting the travel
Like every regular Tuesday, I was with my Boss for the weekly update. While I was giving the updates, we focused on the team we ramped up in BCN. It was about 8 months and we were seeing great results; however, I expressed the concern of not being able to connect with them at the level I do with my team here in India. Even though we used all modern method to meet and try to connect, there was always hit and miss and that kept me thirsty.
Suddenly I heard — “You should go meet them” I did not understand it at first and then he said it will be good if you visit the BCN office and meet the guys. Well! my soul was jumping and dancing but outside I kept the composure and said, Sure.
Passport and the Visa
Now you will know the reason, why I kept a separate section dedicated to Passport and visa. My passport had expired in 2016. I never got the urge to renew it just to use it as an ID for taking loan or filling any form. However, I had made a resolution at the beginning of 2019 that I will get my passport renewed. Hence, I applied for renewal, booked a slot, went to passport office. After step 2 I was sent to meet the passport office manager, she abruptly asked me for my educational certificate. I asked why, she said go write an application that you don’t need a passport showing you are educated, I was shocked — what? I asked. She responded your old passport is of type — “ECR category” and while renewing it if you don’t submit your 10th certificate we will issue the same. I did not know a thing about it. However, I read and found I would never get work visa for any country. Hence, I took another slot and went again, and all was okay.
I received my passport but my police verification was not yet done, so the dude turns up to my house and asks for all kinds of documents and as soon as he sees my old passport was from Jharkhand, He immediately asked for even more documentation — I showed him the new passport too, that I have received it. Unfortunately, my police verification failed.
After I raised and escalation, I received a call from passport office to whom I explained everything, but the person was supposedly trained to give time slot and he did that perfectly- only thing he forgot to tell that I was not supposed to go to same visa office but to the regional head office. Anyways the security guard at the passport office told me that I was in wrong place and hence I reached the regional passport office and after being in the queue got to meet the passport officer. After I explained her everything, she showed that she was upset with the “dude” but then smiled and said the “dude” wants to verify your nationality. Thanks to my call center background I almost uttered “WTF”. I was expecting that she would reject the “dude’s” rejection and approve my passport however she sent my application for police verification again. I smiled at her and said, that same “dude” will come to verify, and she said it’s the process.
That’s the time when I googled how to bribe someone.
Finally, I had passport successfully approved by police. Yay! And my boss just told me to go international…
For couple of days I was just thinking and then I spoke with a colleague cum friend cum mentor about it, the next min I got the details of whom to contact for tickets and an introductory email to Visa agency.
Went through the visa agency as it was my first experience and did not want to get bounced around, we picked up a date and booked the tickets. Collected all the documents and prepared my application. Took an appointment for visa document submission and went.
I was before time and the office was empty — only the security guard and the application collector but he is a guy of ethics and made me wait till my slot time came. Then I was called and asked for my documents. Looking at those properly listed documents, he rejected it and gave me a new list of documents. Supposedly they needed 1 year of bank statement and 6 months of salary slip and many more for a 7 days visa. I was taken aback, he gave me another slot and I could not make it in that time. I went the next day and he was furious as to how can I simply walk in. lol the office was very busy with me, the guard and him. Still he called me the next day — I had to.
To my surprise before the 7th day EOB, I got my passport with an approved visa on it.
The Flight
My Flight was in morning to Dubai and then to Barcelona. I reached airport early and checked in, bought a book, eat breakfast and finally acted reading!
The gates opened and I boarded the flight, Woah! Emirates is awesome that’s the voice I heard within me. Reached my seat and settled. Watched movies and when the hostess came, I denied the food only to realize that it was free (already paid for). Well there’s the second flight to compensate! Ting…
I reached Dubai, Connections this way please, connections this way please… If ever I will have memory flashes like Jason Bourne, I am sure this would be part of it… The red connection boards, everyone walking fast and different faces. Kept pace and suddenly a gate opened I was hurried in a bus. I reached next gate and funny thing happened with me. I had two extra hours in between but the time difference confused me and the display boards.
The display boards in Dubai airport has an extra column, it’s the last column that tells you how many min it will take for you to reach the gate from the place where the board is. With so much of hustle and time difference playing at the back of my mind, I thought that column was for the time the flight goes and it showed 6 mins for my flight. Again, I said “WTF” and ran, don’t judge right now… I had to.
I reached the gate, it was closed. Damn! Not a single “May I help you” but many shops. Okay I said to myself and went to the restroom as it was more urgent than missing the flight. After I was done and was relaxed, I guess the brain started functioning and I realized that I have almost two hours before the flight goes. Then I was like why it would say 6 min on the board and then I looked at the closest display board and it said 2 min. Now I knew the reason why they have added the extra column.
Now mind at peace I sat near the gate and as the boarding started, I joined the queue and Holy mother of god what is this, a flight or a hotel! Emirates is super awesome…
I enjoyed the flight and compensated for the miss too 😉
Brothers and the day out
After Immigration check I went out and waited near the conveyor belt to collect my bag, spoke with family and ting! I got a message. It said “Ravi, Waiting opposite your exit in a restaurant white tree in front of, Welcome to Europe”
As I walked out, I saw a huge man standing with my name, I waved, and he saw. With all smiles we met I tried to shake hands and he hugged. Then pointed towards another huge guy with a baseball cap. We waved too.
The two huge guys were Robert Woschee and Andre Ruckner. It did not feel as if we were meeting for first time, it was an instant connection. We sat for 5 mins and then walked out. Rob had everything planned. We took taxi and reached hotel. We decided to meet at the restaurant for dinner after freshening up and we did. We spoke about work and Andre gave some special gifts. We bonded over dinner and I got to know more about Germany. We also planned about Monday day-out and realized we all were too tired to stay up any longer and we moved towards the room, In the lift we decided to make a WhatsApp groups to plan things.
Morning, we met at the restaurant had a nice Spanish breakfast and then waited for the taxi, as it was a holiday, we could not find a taxi hence the reception called for it. We three then reached the place called the plaza to start our city tour. Rob the planner had things sorted out and the two little brothers tagged along. We clicked photos and looked around, the tour was voice guided and to my surprise there was a Hindi channel too. While listening to the guide and watching the beautiful city of Barcelona I noticed couple of things that stood out for me.
The graffiti, the Catatonias flags and the medieval architecture. The city has a major impact of graffiti culture, most of the wall, shop shutters and different object were having graffiti some cool ones and some not worthy to look at.
The architecture is a mix of modern and medieval times, the “la sagrada familia” is so fascinating that I had to get down and walk around to see it up close. Its mesmerizing to see the beauty in the complex design. This is where we bought our ESPANA plates and the cool hats. I met some Urdu speaking vendor and I mistook him of being an Indian, he was a Pakistani. My first ever encounter with a Pakistan resident — they look, feel and speak the same.
My reaction intrigued Andre and he was interested to know the history of India and Pakistan, we parked this discussion for later and continued our city tour clicking photos. We felt a little twitch in our belly and there Rob was already taking the Sausages out from his magical bag! The German Sausages, it gave us enough energy to continue our trip and was tasty too. While we chewed on the sausages, we saw the beautiful beaches, the buildings and lovely people.
We had lot of fun and made great rapport between three of us. Here you see, Andre’s reaction to the sausages just to tease Rob! While we reached the plaza, we were looking for a place to hog.
WhatsApp was full of messages from Danny, Maik and Ahcene as we were planning to meet the whole team in the evening, and we decided to look for the best place that served Paella.
We were back in our rooms by late afternoon and rested so we could reach the place Dan found. I was excited and had my fears too, dressed up and checked my cards. Prayed a bit to god to make my Amex work 😉 — The experience with shops and Amex in HYD is sad hence needed god'ss help.
The boys, the office and the Quarter end
Cheriff was the fancy place that serves Paella, we reached about 7ish and by now I could experience the German side of punctuality. Generally, I am always before time but oh! Boy the dudes from Germany are too good.
Maik, Dan and Ahcene are seriously fit, I realized as they welcomed us into the restaurant. We hugged and made noise. The football rivals could see each other eye to eye. I could only image 100 ways how Andre could squish Dan. Seeing the boys live was a totally a different experience when compared to a video call. While I was enjoying the moment, Ahcene was busy folding his bicycle as the waiter pointed it was not safe to park the bike outside, next min the bike was folded into a wheel and kept in one corner!
I got a message, Bhai it’s a baby girl. It was Nand from Hyderabad. I shared this beautiful message with all, and we made a congratulations video and sent it to Nand. He told me he was so happy to receive the message from all of us when I was back in HYD. After a stomach full of seafood and beer, we walked out. Making jokes and getting to know each other a little more. Ahcene is not always busy, he smiles and laughs too. Finally, we called it a day and came back to rest enough. So, we could get to office on time.
Next morning met Rob and Andre in the busy hotel lobby, grabbed the breakfast and walked to the office. As we entered, we were welcomed by the German presales team. The handsome Dennis and cool looking Axel were too warm and as we settled the rest of the team appeared.
The office was so well placed. Adam was in his den as we met him and discussed about some of the IT requirements, which was simple enough for him to take care off. As Kai walked in, we greeted and hugged, and he went in his corner to do the magic he does with the product.
I met all the ladies (Names not mentioned) and the dudes, it was little scary for me as Spain is all about kisses and hugs. somehow, I managed and thanks to all the ladies for being kind to me. Everyone @ BCN office is a sweetheart. If ever I get an opportunity I would run to work from that office or would recreate the magic at home.
The rest of the day, I spent talking to the boys and saw Andre’s magic in action. Ahcene was stuck to his chair did calls after calls. Dan discussed many things and arranged things for us. Maik had Rob and Andre next to him. We had a team meeting and discussed things about work and what is expected from each other. I took notes of things that could make their life easier.
Now was the time I met Nathalie. A charismatic personality and such a loving person, unfortunately there was a client at risk and that was the point of our discussion. Later I got a ping from her about how easy it was to knock out the challenge for us being under one roof. I wish, I responded.
Later after office we went with few of the BCN folks to a local joint, it was Nat’s kind gesture to welcome us and meet the rest of the team. The place was small, specially when you look at Rob, Andre and me but the place was all love and food. Superb evening came to end as I met Mr. Challenge. He is bundle of energy and too much emotions. All he wants is the best for all. I understood he had some unanswered questions so deflected his comments for our formal meeting and a friend helped 😊.
Next days were filled with one on ones with Sales/Presales spearheads. We discussed various things, and everyone was able to acknowledge the improvement in support from past two years since we started. I noted the areas to work on and explained few work flows, also discussed about how different a support conversation is than of a sales conversation with clients. The reason why there are needs for logs more than once or twice. Thanks to my discussion with Rob and Andre, which helped in establishing that East Germany is difficult to handle for locals too.
Meeting Nat and Lorena was very informative as we exchanged our processes. I believe our teams can complement each other more going forward.
Fortunately, former office was next door and it was sweet meeting an old friend — Osarabo. We had lunch together at Tito’s and remembered the old days and he brought great memories of Joshi (Joe) and Me, as what a symphony it used to be working with us. Thanks to Osarabo and Rob for cherishing those days.
Friday was the last day at BCN office and it was the last day of quarter too. The office is mostly full of sales and presales folks and it was amazing to see everyone in action. I can say I have witnessed awesomeness and the Pizza party too.
Again, hugs and kisses but by now I was used to it. Next time around I will be the master of the art. Before I end this chapter, here is one person who brought the BCN office to life. Tony a beard man and happy soul. You would find him as you enter the office and his energy is infectious, he will energize you while you enter to have an outstanding day — amazing member of the team.
Time to say bye.
As we traveled back to airport. I dropped Andre and Rob at their entry gate, we hugged. Suddenly I felt heavy, something was stuck in my chest and eyes were all watery. Crazy I am a tough guy as I mumbled, not sure why the freak water droplets rolled down my cheeks.
Last five days were so lovely and engaging, it felt like I was with my brothers and parting away was causing pain. That’s life I said and swallowed the lump while walking inside the airport. Next min I got a message, Ravi are you alright? the freaky water droplets came back. Yes, I replied.
This pic cheered me up and I was happy travelling back home.

July. That was the last time I was in Barcelona. I was on vacation with A & M. First time for them; definitely not the first for me. I can barely remember how many times I have been in town: so many times that I can formally nominate Barcelona my third home-town, after Milan and London. I speak the language, I am familiar with the places, I simply feel at home.
Next week I am supposed to be in Barcelona, one more time. I will chair a conference and I have some personal business. I truly hope that everything will be resolved peacefully, that the vote will take place smoothly and that Spain will give local population the right to choose their destiny.

In this series of articles, I will take you behind the scenes of my global adventures conducting executive programs and delivering keynote presentations. Join me as I share my most entertaining and often humorous stories from my decades on the road. You can subscribe to ensure you never miss an article.
Between 1987 and 1988, I spent about one week every month in Barcelona, Spain, consulting for a company that was implementing my multi-track program for corporate transformation. On average, I stayed in that city about five days every month, conducting my programs for about 250 managers and executives in that company.
Typically, on a Monday evening every month, after teaching my afternoon doctoral seminar at the University of Pittsburgh, I would fly from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, where my British Airways plane would then pick up some additional passengers before continuing on its direct flight to London. Once I arrived in London and went through customs, I would then take a flight to Barcelona on Iberia Airlines. Several days later, usually on Saturday of that same week, I would then reverse my trusty route that brought me there in order to travel back to Pittsburgh, so I could again teach my doctoral seminar on Monday afternoon as well as attend to my other university responsibilities during the rest of the week.
As noted, I followed this same routine, once a month, for almost two years. In addition, since I was taking that long, cross-Atlantic trip to Europe, I often extended my stay and traveled to other nearby countries in order to deliver additional keynote presentations or conduct some other top-management programs — before returning to Pittsburgh. It seemed I was constantly “on the road again,” as melodically captured in Willie Nelson’s famous song of that same title.
During my two-year consulting project in Barcelona, the senior executives of that company would occasionally ask me to deliver a presentation or workshop to a group of executives from other companies in Spain in order to inspire those other Spanish companies to also proceed with corporate transformation. The goal was to encourage all those Spanish companies (and Spain as a whole) to become more competitive with their counterparts in other European nations. In fact, in 1986, Spain joined the “European Communities” (12 countries in total at that time), which would later become the European Union in 1993, after the fall of communism and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was clear to me that many Spanish companies knew they had to transform their way of doing business in order to succeed in a much larger — unified — European marketplace.
On one particular occasion, the CEO of that Barcelona company asked me to present my approach to transforming organizations to about 50 distinguished senior executives from other Spanish companies who were already successful inside Spain, but were concerned just how well their organizations would fare when they had to complete with other European companies. Not surprisingly, such an important program had to be planned many months in advance in order to coordinate the travel schedules of those very busy senior executives. To do justice to the anticipated importance of my presenting a completely integrated program for achieving long-term organizational success, the chosen venue for this program was a fancy resort hotel on the top of a mountain, just outside the city of Barcelona. I was absolutely delighted to have been given this opportunity to further extend the reach of my work to several more organizations in Spain — in such a beautiful setting.
I scheduled my usual flights from Pittsburgh to Barcelona. A private car would then meet me at the Barcelona airport and transport me to that mountain-top resort. I was especially looking forward to this exciting adventure, not realizing that simply getting there would be much more demanding than I could ever have imagined beforehand.
When it was time for me to take this special trip to Spain, there was a snowstorm already taking place on the East Coast of the U.S. Since my flights were neither canceled nor delayed, I proceeded on my journey. However, when my Pittsburgh flight was descending on its assigned runway at the Philadelphia International Airport, my plane grazed a service van that had lost its way, due to the blistering snow that had been falling for several hours. Even though we landed safely (after experiencing a huge jolt just before we touched down on the runway), the plane was damaged in the incident and therefore could not continue on its scheduled flight to London. Moreover, there were currently no available planes to take the place of the damaged one. The remainder of my flights to London and Barcelona, therefore, were officially cancelled.
Once all us passengers departed the damaged plane, I checked the flight schedules in the airport lounge: There were no more flights to London that evening. The next flight from Philadelphia to London wouldn’t depart until the next evening. But I had to be in Barcelona tomorrow, since my presentation to those 50 Spanish executives was scheduled to take place the following morning in that mountain-top resort. If I waited for the next flight to London from Philadelphia (tomorrow evening), I wouldn’t arrive in Barcelona in time to attend my own presentation.
In my mind, there was no way I could miss that executive meeting on the mountain top just outside of Barcelona, which had been arranged six months earlier. I had to be there. Period. If that special event did not take place as scheduled, it would be especially disappointing (perhaps even embarrassing) for the Barcelona company that was sponsoring my presentation for those executives from several other companies.
As such, I was in desperate need of a Plan B.
After waiting on a long line to speak to an airport concierge, I learned that there was only one possible way through my current predicament: As it turned out, British Airways did have a flight the next morning at 9 am, which would get me to London the same day, so I could take a later flight from there to Barcelona and still arrive in the evening. But there was a catch: That morning flight to London did not depart from the Philadelphia International Airport (as I already knew from the evening before) but was scheduled to depart from the JFK International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City … which was more than 100 miles from my current location.
Basically, proceeding with Plan B, I would first have to rent a car and drive — through a snowstorm — to arrive at JFK Airport in Jamaica, Queens, by early morning. Ordinarily, the driving time would be about 2 hours between the two airports. But with the bad weather, it was hard to say how much additional time would be needed for my drive to New York City. However, it was now 9:00 pm in the evening, so there would not be any traffic jams on the road going north, other than what slowdowns might occur from the storm. Since I had to arrive in Barcelona tomorrow (so I could deliver my presentation the very next morning), it seemed I had no other choice.
More specifically, that flight to London was scheduled to depart from JFK at 9:00 am in the morning, New York Time, which was 2:00 pm in the afternoon, London Time. That flight was scheduled to arrive at 6:00 pm in the evening, London Time. Doing the math, given those departure and arrival times (taking into account the 1-hour difference in time zone) suggested a four-hour flight. But I knew very well that it usually takes about 8 hours to fly from New York to London, with an average jet speed of about 600 miles per hour. Yet British Airlines was offering that same flight in half the time? Naturally, I asked the concierge: “How is this flight time even possible?”
The concierge then informed me that the Concorde (a supersonic jet that can travel more than 1200 miles per hour) would be making the flight, which would only take half of the usual flight time. Naturally, I (or rather my client) had to pay for the difference in airline fees (since the Concorde flight was much more expensive). But for the time being, money was no object in this adventure: I had to be in Barcelona in time for my presentation! Once I made the reservation for the Concorde (and paid the extra fee), I phoned my contact person in Spain who was coordinated all my educational programs there. I let him know that I would keep him abreast of any changes in my travel schedule. But if everything worked as planned, he would pick me up at the Barcelona airport and drive me straightaway to that mountain-top resort.
After I picked up my one suitcase in the baggage claim area, a service van took me to the airport rental car place. It was now about 10:45 pm in the evening. Because of the storm, they only had two cars left to rent. I was in luck!
By midnight, I was already driving on the road to New York City, thoroughly exhausted from the unexpected events on my trip so far — but I had to keep going. I also had to drive as safely as possible, given the bad weather. In fact, my average speed was only about 40 miles an hour on the New Jersey highway (the posted speed limit was 65 miles an hour), since I had trouble seeing the road through the swirling snowfall.
I finally arrived at the JFK International Airport by 4:00 am in the morning. I had a few hours before I had to check in for my 9:00 am flight on the Concorde. But before I returned my rental car at the airport, I parked on a nearby street, set the alarm on my digital watch, and did my best to rest my eyes and maybe even sleep for a few hours.
At 7:30 am, I was already at the gate, where I then boarded my Concorde flight. Finally, the process was going smoothly. I must say: It was really nice experiencing that super-fast mode of transportation and flying so high in the sky (60,000 feet above sea level) that you could see the curvature of the Earth. As tired as I was, I kept looking out the little window by my seat as I marveled at this amazing technology that would hopefully allow me to fulfill my professional commitment to that inspired group of Spanish executives. Good news: The Concorde arrived in London pretty much on schedule at about 6:15 pm in the evening, local time.
Then I faced the next nightmare on my precarious journey to Barcelona.
When I entered the large room in the Heathrow Airport for going through customs, I was shocked to see a few hundred people who were waiting on a very, very long line to present their passport to a row of customs agents (and answer any questions about their trip and its purpose). My first response: “Oh my God. It’ll take me a few hours to get thought that line!” Since I had missed my previous connection from London to Barcelona (because my plane from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was damaged when it hit a van on the runway), I had to purchase a new plane ticket to Barcelona. I had already discovered that there was only one available flight this evening to that airport, leaving London at 7:45 pm and arriving in Barcelona at 11:00 pm, local time. If I missed that last flight to Barcelona, I wouldn’t get to deliver my presentation as scheduled. I would, once again, be in the exact same predicament as I had been in Philadelphia, just the evening before.
Basically, for me to make it to Barcelona so I could deliver my presentation to those executives on the very next morning, I first had to get through customs, next I had to make my way to the ticket counter in the airport lobby so I could purchase my ticket to Barcelona (and check in my suitcase), and then I had to sprint to the departing gate in time to make the flight, which was only 90 minutes from now. Keep in mind: There was no Internet in those days, so I couldn’t process anything online (such as scheduling my flight to Barcelona, let alone purchasing my airline ticket). I had to get to the right ticket counter, in person, which could only work if I got through customs in a hurry and then make it to the ticket counter in a very short period of time.
With my one suitcase in tow, I walked up to a uniformed customs agent who was positioned in the back of the room and asked him if there was some way that I could get to the front of the customs line, since I had to catch the last flight that evening to Barcelona. I told him that I had to make a keynote presentation the following morning, which was arranged for 50 executives more than six months ago. I exaggerated a little when I added that my professional reputation was at stake, so he would be sure to know that I really needed his help.
The customs agent listened intently and then said: “Everyone in this room has to be somewhere else by yesterday. I’m sorry for your situation, but you’ll have to wait on the same customs line, just like everyone else.” I also listened intently, but I wasn’t pleased with his response, so I asked again: “Isn’t there some way I can get through this line more quickly?” Again, the customs agent responded, “I’m sorry, Sir. But there is nothing I or anyone else can do. Everyone has to wait on the same line before going through customs. Several planes must have landed about the same time, which results in these long custom lines.”
It now seemed that this latest obstacle to my getting to Barcelona on time had thoroughly defeated me. Nevertheless, I thanked him for his consideration and began walking away to get on that very long line as soon as possible — even though the effort would be fruitless in the end. But a few seconds later, I instinctively turned around and walked back to that same customer agent and tried one more time to compel him to join me on my sacred mission: “I appreciate what you are saying, sir, but are you telling me that there is no way under the sun, no workaround, no loophole, no alternative … that would allow me to get to the front of the line?”
This time, the customs agent seemed to express a little more compassion on his face, as if another approach had miraculously, yet instantly, emerged from the deep recesses in his mind. He responded with a brand-new perspective on the current situation: “It seems you are going to keep pestering me for the rest of the evening unless I help you. How about this: If you promise to leave me alone and never bother me again, I’ll take you to the front of the customs line. Just follow me and all will be well.”
He proceeded to walk to the front of the customs line, with me right behind him. In a few moments, I was in the front of the line, showed my passport to the person who sat behind the counter and then answered his standard questions about why I was visiting London.
As soon as I had cleared customs, I thanked my dear friend who had stood right beside me for the entire time, and then I dashed to the designated counter in the airport lobby to purchase an airline ticket (and check in my suitcase) for that last evening flight to Barcelona.
When I was settled in my seat on the plane, I finally could take some deep breaths and reflect on the last 24 hours of my facing — and then surmounting — one roadblock after another on my very long journey to that distant mountain top. Yes, in the end, I made it to my intended destination on time and delivered my presentation to that inspired group of senior executives. Years later, I still marvel at all I had to go through, behind the scenes, to share my theories and methods with people and organizations around the globe.

So, you like to visit or would like to see Barcelona, but wish it were not so crowded and full of tourists like yourself? Travel writer Susan Kraus has a perfect alternative destination for you.
It was a beautiful autumn afternoon in Tarragona, Spain. Locals packed into the pedestrian-only cobbled streets of the medieval town center, and we were there with them, having found a perch on the side of a rock wall of the 12th- century Cathedral of Tarragona. All eyes were focused on the street, where a parade unlike anything I’d ever seen before was approaching. Costumed figures led the procession and were marching throughout the ranks. There were magical beasts spouting fire (seriously, fireworks and sparklers erupting from mouths and tails), dragons, sea serpents, massive bulls, a mermaid-dragon, and even a giant golden chicken. Diables ( five-foot high handcrafted heads of biblical, historical, and contemporary figures) bobbed past. Surrounding towns were represented by dancers and marchers, all in traditional regalia reflecting their local heritage. Musicians played bagpipes made from goat bellies and skins, drums of all sizes, flutes, and horns. Young girls in white lace dresses and red sashes performed the folk dances of their Catalan traditions. Participating towns were represented by monster mascots and their own strolling bands. It was a riotous mix of colors and sound.
This was the procession celebrating Santa Tecla, a beloved patron saint. Her festival, spanning 10 days each autumn, celebrates the return of a relic, her arm. The year 2022 marked 700 years since its return, but even without that milestone number, it’s clear from the celebrations that this is one very special arm — and that the traditions honoring it are alive and well.
As I stood among the crowd, I couldn’t help but contrast it to a parade in the United States. We would have barricades up and police ensuring no one ran into the street or got close to the fireworks spouting from the costumed creatures. But here there were no barricades, no warning signs. Sitting next to me was a mother, three kids in tow. I asked her if there were rules or guidelines I didn’t know about. She looked confused. “It is Santa Tecla, always the parade like this. So, don’t wear flammable clothing,” she replied, gesturing at two of her children who had run into the street and were hopping up and down around what looked like a dancing, metal-plated armadillo. “See, my kids have on old cotton. They just brush off the sparks.”
After the parade, we walked back to our hotel. In the square, a Catalan band was playing to hundreds of people who were swaying and dancing to the music. There were concerts every night all over the city. People don’t sleep much during Santa Tecla.
But it was the human towers, the next afternoon, the “castels” (castles), that blew me away. Dozens of cities and towns have teams, for the competition; people climb up each other’s backs, stand on each other’s shoulders, many stories high. They do not start to descend, sliding down backs, until a small child completes the tower by climbing to the top and raising a hand. This authentic, exhilarating celebration was our introduction to a city I had never known much about but is now one of my favorite European destinations.
Never Heard of Tarragona? (You’re Not Alone)Like Barcelona, its more famous cousin 52 miles to the north, Tarragona is an eastern Spanish port city on the Balearic Sea, leading to the Mediterranean. It is a modern city of just under 140,000, but with a medieval core of twisty pedestrian streets leading to the magnificent cathedral. Roman ruins seem ubiquitous, from the time when Tarragona was “Tarraco,” one of the earliest Roman settlements on the Iberian Peninsula, more important to the empire than Barcelona, and older than Madrid.
But Tarragona is not detailed in most popular guidebooks, from Fodor’s to Rick Steves. Those omissions are strange because Tarragona feels like how people described Barcelona some 50 years ago — when it was just as wonderful and full of historic and cultural attractions, but not drowning in tourists. Tarragona still has that feel of a rich cultural center, but with less hassle. No lines and no waits for tickets. No jostling in front of tourist photo spots.
Tarragona feels different. Relaxed. One example: Many Spanish cities have a rambla, a tree-lined promenade in the middle of the city where people stroll, congregate, and visit. In Barcelona, Las Ramblas is now congested, tourist-driven, dotted by souvenir kiosks every 20 feet, and full of jacked-up prices and pickpockets. But, in Tarragona, the Rambla Nova is for locals: parents pushing strollers, older couples arm-in-arm or sitting on park benches under the trees, and gaggles of teens checking each other out. There are street musicians, but they are not encircled by throngs of tourists. No kiosks. No pickpockets. This rambla is for the people who live here.
Unlike in Barcelona, in Tarragona it is easy to find wonderful and affordable accommodation. Our hotel, the B&B Centro Urbis, was on a corner overlooking the Placa de Corsini, which was lined with umbrella tables of bakeries and restaurants. Across the Placa was the Mercat Central, built in 1915 to house stalls of butchers, fisherman, and vendors of produce, fruit, baked goods, and flowers. Now, the Mercat Central is an upscale market for all of these goods, along with fabulous take-out food. Within the historic building, there are now escalators descending to a modern, spacious underground grocery store.
A More Relaxed DestinationThe sights and daily bustle of Tarragona became our entertainment. We would watch everyday life from the open window of our room. Each morning, parents walked their kids to school across the open square. Each afternoon, kids kicked soccer balls and rode bikes as parents bought groceries for supper at the Mercat. Street musicians provided a backdrop. After just a few days, we were immersed in a different lifestyle — people walked everywhere, were unhurried, relaxed.
Touring Tarragona was serendipitous. We tossed out the checklist and itinerary; we took hours for a meal. It felt good simply to sip wine and watch the parade of ordinary life, so different from our lives at home, passing by. Of course, there are things to see and do in Tarragona … but being there is pleasurable enough.
To See and Do
Roman Amphitheater — Dating from the 2nd century, when more than 13,000 people would flood this amphitheater to watch gladiators battle — and public executions.
National Archeological Museum of Tarragona — Covers 8 centuries, providing context to understand the city’s cultural evolution.
Circ Roma — Chariot races were held here as far back as the 1st century. Small museum of artifacts. Kids love the tunnels. Great views from the rooftop.
Cathedral of Tarragona — Built on the site of a Roman temple and Moorish mosque, with the Catholic cathedral dating from 1154. I loved the interior cloister. Small museum included.
El Serallo — The Waterfront district has a fishing village feel with pastel houses, waterfront promenade, and cafes with special fish dishes.
Museum of Modern Art — This is a jewel of a museum with changing exhibits. Its modern design is such a contrast to the cobbled streets of the old city that surround it.
Mercat Central Built in 1915 to centralize the stalls of butchers, fisherman, and other vendors, this is now an upscale shopping area.
Casa de la Festa — This small museum celebrates the festivals’ costumes, parade figures and history. Google “Casa de la Festa in Tarragona” to see delightful pictures of parade beasts and diables.
Port of Tarragona Museum — Maritime history, old ships, and artifacts galore are housed in this high-ceilinged, spacious waterfront warehouse.
Beaches — Playa de Milagro is walkable from the city center, along a bay with gentle waves. There are 15 kilometers of coastline, from rocky ledges to sandy coves. Many more beaches with amenities are with an hour’s drive.
Trails — There are 75 kilometers of paths to hike, mountain bike or ride horseback in and around Tarragona. Tourism offices have maps and suggestions.
Aqualon — A water park with slides, rafting, waterfalls and play equipment for youth and with deck chairs under palm trees for parents.
Jungle Trek is an adventure park with ziplines, rope bridges, and forest hikes.
For more Tarragona attractions, see tarragonaturisme.cat
Lodging TipsB&B Hotels (some do not do breakfast, but all have 24-hour coffee) originated in France but is a rapidly expanding European chain. Hotels are smaller, featuring minimalist décor and an IKEA feel. Prices shift with demand, but our shoulder-season rates were under $60 a night. If you’re planning to travel around Europe, consider a low-fee annual membership, with perks like 10% off every stay and more. Staying in Tarragona can be much less expensive than Barcelona, and trains and buses run regularly. Many Barcelona tours are available from Tarragona, with transportation provided.

In case you missed it, Barcelona have signed a lot of players.
Xavi Hernández has a whole new toy box — and while that’s exciting, finding the balance in his starting XI might be akin to solving a Rubik’s cube. Move any one piece, and you realise several others have to move with it.
This is particularly an issue in the back line. Traditionally, the most stable and unalterable part of the team. “You don’t mess with your centre back partnership”, I hear echoed through the eons of football clichés. And if Xavi is to go along with it, finding the right partnership early is of critical importance.
Today I’d like to play God (or rather, football manager) and work through the options Xavi has at his disposal.
We’ll discuss what is required from a CB in Xavi’s system, take a look at each profile, and knit together a winning combination.
This is a long read, so I’ve split it into chapters. Feel free to pick it up and come back to it.
Alright, let’s get started.
On the ball, Xavi’s centre backs have a varied level of responsibility depending on the game phase.
In general build up, when Barca have established possession, the centre backs are integral to ball progression. That’s because they have more time on the ball than anyone else.
Take the example below, against Real Madrid’s mid-block. The centre backs remain narrow, often supported by a full back (Alba), with the defensive midfielder ahead of them.
Madrid are doing what most organised teams will do: 1) man-mark the defensive midfielder and 2) block the passing lanes to the attacking midfielders.
This is a problem that needs solving. The centre backs need to be smart and technical enough to do so. They usually have three options:
The more of these options the CB can execute consistently, the more valuable they are on the ball. If they have a supreme passing range, and can also drive forward with the ball, they tick all the boxes.
Later we’ll look at the data to help us choose our ideal candidate.
Under pressure
The second scenario that Barca centre backs face is heavy opposition pressure. However, Xavi’s team has a tendency to be pragmatic in these situations, looking for a way out as early as possible.
This means the centre backs don’t have as much responsibility as you might expect.
Usually, they will either go backwards to goalkeeper Ter Stegen — who then is tasked with a progressive pass — or sideways to the full backs. The centre backs don’t tend to take risks.
At most, the centre back will be asked to play a diagonal pass, often to the full back. Which is why, if we’re ranking offensive attributes, passing range is the most important.
Calmness is also necessary, of course. Plus the ability to identify and execute these passes quickly.
Now, on to actual defending.
To be blunt, Xavi’s system is extremely demanding on its centre backs. Not only are we looking for an excellent technical profile, but defenders who can manoeuvre in high-risk situations. Xavi’s Barca commit players forward very aggressively, often leaving the centre backs with a lot of space to cover. Especially if the opponent goes direct.
In this example, eight players are caught ahead of the ball, and Ronald Araújo is burdened with a huge responsibility.
It’s not infrequent to see Barca centre backs isolated like this. Here, the decision whether to press aggressively, or slow the opponent down, is of utmost importance. Making the right call, and executing it decisively, is a huge part of the job.
So the next thing we’re looking for is a proficiency in 1 vs 1 duels. An imposing, athletic profile, capable of either winning the ball outright or (just as useful), slowing the opponent down until the midfielders get back.
Statistically, we can look at aerial duels won %, tackle %, fouls committed, and how often a player gets dribbled past to help find our man.
But wait, there’s more.
On top of this, we’re also looking for the best possible ‘traditional’ centre backs. Those that make important defensive actions inside the box, and nulify the opposition at critical moments.
These players are harder to find using raw data, because their decisions require context to understand. However, we will look at some clips to give us an idea at which defenders excel at this.
Ok, let’s summarise what we’re looking for in our ideal centre back. In a rough order of preference:
With all this in mind, it’s about time to look at our centre back choices, and try to find the right balance and partnership.
Age: 23
At 6'1"" and built like a heavyweight boxer, the Uruguyan behemoth is a unique and important profile in Barca’s squad.
He is clearly Barca’s most aggressive, physical and fastest defender. He wins the most aerial duels (73.5%), has the highest tackle success rate (76.7%) and gets dribbled past only 0.28 times per 90, less than anyone except Gerard Piqué.
In other words, he’s outstanding 1 vs 1, and a rugged ball winner who’s not afraid to engage far from his own box. He’s also a major threat from set pieces.
Sounds pretty good, right?
He has, however, shown some lapses of judgement when defending his own area. Often as a result of over-exuberance. Whether it’s abandoning his position, or getting too tight and committing a foul, he can — at times — lack the calmness that typifies the world’s best centre backs.
But Araújo’s bigger weakness is his on-the-ball prowess. While his pass completion number are good, he is often slow to identify the right option. He can be guilty of dwelling on the ball until the passing lane is blocked.
On top of that, he makes more mistakes on the ball and is dispossessed more often than any of the current Barca centre backs (Koundé has more errors, but we’ll talk about him later). This is highlighted most when Araújo is put under pressure.
He is, however, quite effective at carrying the ball forward. His speed and strength make him difficult to dispossess, and he’s brave enough to take responsibility.
All-in-all, we’re looking at a brute of a defender who, while not dreadful in possession, still needs to work on that aspect of his game.
Strengths: Barca’s premier ball winner, excellent 1v1, athletic and quick, not afraid to carry the ball forward
Weaknesses: Vision and passing range, uncomfortable under pressure
Age: 21
I thought it would be fun to put Eric next, because he’s at the other end of the defensive spectrum.
Without a doubt, Eric García is Barca’s best ball-playing centre back. He averages around 95% pass completion, and is by far the most accurate passer over long distances. He’s also the most proactive passer, identifying options and executing immediately. And to complete his passing profile, he’s deadly accurate with both feet.
He’s also very good at carrying the ball through the lines.
But, as I’m sure you know, this all comes at a cost. If Araújo is Barca’s best ball winner, Eric is by far the worst. He wins the least aerial duels (56.1%), is the least effective tackler (a pitiful 37% success rate), and gets beaten more than anyone else (0.75 times per 90).
It’s clear that Eric uses aggression to make up for his lack of physical stature— and it’s not totally in vain. Only Christensen makes more interceptions than Eric (2.29 per 90). But his aggression is a double edged sword; he commits more fouls than anyone else (1.59 per 90).
To give Eric his due, when he doesn’t have to win 1 vs 1 duels, he’s a reasonably stable defender. His anticipation inside the box is usually good, and he’s 100% committed, always. But at the highest level he can and has been bullied.
He’s young, so he has time to develop physically. And his skillset is so specialised that he’s worth keeping around. But you’d be hard-pressed to trust him when it’s do or die.
Strengths: Supreme passer with both feet, identifies passes quickly, carries the ball effectively, a solid box defender
Weaknesses: Loses duels often, commits a lot of fouls, a very inefficient ball winner
Age: 26
Christensen is a new addition to the squad who has already shown a lot of promise. He sits between Araújo and Eric on the real defender — ball-player spectrum, and I’d go so far as to call him the most balanced centre back in the squad.
Defensively his numbers are stellar. He made the most tackles + interceptions last season (3.13 per 90), while not getting beaten very often (0.30 times per 90), and also making very few fouls (0.78 per 90).
We can infer, then, that he’s a very efficient ball winner. Even his tackle success rate (66.7%) is only eclipsed by Araújo.
He’s less aggressive than the Uruguayan, but an equally effective defender in most scenarios. He wins less aerial duels (only 61.9%), but he’s better suited to defending his own box due to his calmness and positional awareness.
Christensen’s other advantage is a rounded profile in possession. He too is capable of carrying the ball forward. But more importantly, he has excellent vision and passing range. After Eric, he’s the most consistent passer over long distances.
A balanced profile that is certainly in contention for a starting position.
Strengths: A composed ball winner, commits few fouls, good vision and passing range, a great box defender
Weaknesses: Aerial duels, not as fast or athletic than some of his competition
Age: 23
Koundé is a very interesting case, and not just because of the fanfare around his signing.
Of all the centre backs in the squad, Koundé is by far the most forward thinking. He is a willing ball carrier, who is often seen marauding into the opponent’s final third.
This offensive movement has been facilitated by Sevilla’s system. The holding midfielder (usually Fernando) drops between the centre backs in possession, creating a pseudo back three. With Koundé on the right, he has license to break forward and become an offensive threat. And he’s not shy about it.
Positionally, this role is quite comparable to how Barca’s inverted full backs operate. It suits Koundé because it makes the most of his ability to break lines, while also remaining an important defensive presence — particularly in transition.
So lets move onto his defensive ability. He is, undoubtedly, an accomplished defender despite his young age. His combination of anticipation, balance, speed and composure is frightening. Not only is he extremely difficult to beat, he reads the game immaculately, making him a superb defender around his own box.
His anticipation borders on prescience; it’s like he’s moving before the ball is played.
In terms of underlying data, he’s most comparable to Christensen. He is dribbled past only 0.33 times per 90 and commits fewer fouls than anyone else (0.72 per 90). His tackle success rate (63%) is middle of the road, as are his aerial duels (64.5% won), but he has an advantage when it comes to speed and athleticism.
You can see why there’s so much excitement around this signing.
Strengths: Excellent 1 vs 1, fast and athletic, great anticipation and composure inside his own box, attacking mentality and high-impact ball carrier
Weaknesses: Lowest pass completion over long distances (73.8%)
Age: 35
Ah, Piqué. A club legend who, even up until last season, was Barcelona’s most important defender. At least, that’s what the data suggests.
When Piqué was on the pitch, Barcelona’s xG difference increased by +0.77 per game, compared to when he wasn’t playing. That’s the biggest impact of any defender last season.
Of course, stats like these need context. Piqué profited from being fit during Barca’s most successful spell of the season. Truth be told, his level has dropped, injuries have blighted him, and physically he sometimes struggles to keep up.
That’s why last season he went to ground more often, and committed more fouls than ever before (1.47 per 90).
However, his defensive numbers are still very adequate. Last season he was second only to Araújo in aerial duels (67.4% won). He was dribbled past less often than anyone (0.22 per 90). He also made the most recoveries (11.8 per 90).
However (spoiler alert) he’s not in my first choice back line.
On the evidence of pre-season, his physical condition is deteriorating considerably. If he can’t be counted on for the vast majority of the campaign, it makes little sense to give him minutes over the other options.
His experience will be useful, as will his leadership. But there’s enough quality in the squad now to warrant phasing him out of the team. And at 35, there’s no shame in that.
Ok, we’ve finally made it. I think this calls for a drum role…
If I were Xavi, my first choice back four would be:
I know, this might come as a surprise. In fact, I’m going against 80% of fans who voted on my Twitter poll. But let me explain.
Christensen — Araújo — Koundé is unbreakable
This is, admittedly, a defence-first selection. By sacrificing a ‘real’ right back I’m taking away an important offensive weapon, right?
Well, not exactly.
As I explained earlier, Barca commit a lot of players forward. At the very least, it’s the front three, plus both attacking midfielders. Sometimes Jordi Alba joins in too. Purely for the sake of balance, I want the remaining players to be defensively imperious. These three — Koundé, Araújo and Christensen — are exactly that.
This decision is made easier by the fact that Xavi’s right back is often inverted. Working in the right half-space, it’s important for the right back to be comfortable on the ball, carry a threat from a deep position, and manage transitions effectively.
Here’s why I think Koundé fits the bill perfectly:
Why Koundé at right back?
Knowing that I want these three in the starting lineup, the question is who’s being ‘sacrificed’ at right back. I’ve gone with Jules Koundé.
The obvious answer is Araújo, but on the evidence I’ve seen, he’s simply not comfortable enough receiving on the touchline or under pressure. Meanwhile, as we’ve seen, Koundé’s role at Sevilla is surprisingly similar to an inverted right back.
For example, he can comfortably receive and progress from the right touchline:
He can drive forward and break lines in the right half-space, which is an incredibly valuable weapon against well-organsied mid blocks:
He can find runners from the right half-space:
He can comfortably snuff out counter-attacks:
And he can defend 1 vs 1 against the world’s best wingers:
It’s unfortunate that, at right back, you might lose his fantastic positional awareness in the box. But for my money it’s a risk worth taking to get both Araújo and Christensen in the starting XI.
Why Christensen at left centre back?
I think Christensen is a fantastic defender. He was a staple in Chelsea’s Champions League winning team, and he’s shown already he can adapt to Barca’s system.
He’s at left centre back specifically for two reasons. 1) I want Araújo on his more comfortable side, because he’s less composed under pressure. 2) Christensen is better equipped to deliver the left-to-right diagonal ball into the right winger.
Barca create a lot of overloads on the left, with the intention of switching the ball over to the right, where Dembélé (or Raphinha) is 1 vs 1. Christensen will execute this more consistently than Araújo.
What about Eric?
I wouldn’t be surprised if Eric García gets decent game time this season. Against teams that provide little attacking threat, perhaps. Equally, I can see him wasting away on the bench.
His performances in pre-season have been excellent. His profile is unique and Barca are certainly more devastating offensively when he’s playing. But at the highest level, the reward isn’t worth the risk.
He has time, though. He’s only 21.
And finally…Piqué?
You might have noticed that Piqué is the only centre back over the age of 26. That’s not ideal. His level might have dropped, but from a squad-dynamics perspective, he’s a useful asset.
I think Piqué will get some game time this year, perhaps to protect a player on a yellow card, or in a rotational situation. But in terms of development, it’s far more important to prioritise every other player on this list.
So there we have it. No doubt plenty of you will have something to say about my selections and reasoning, so I’m continuing the discussion over on Twitter. I hope to see you there.
FINALLY — this is one of the more extensive pieces I’ve put together. If you enjoyed, please do ‘clap’, it helps immensely. And, as always, follow the page for more in-depth Barcelona content.
Until next time!

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

Alright, Barça fans — with love, truly — but who told you to walk into San Siro like you were on a guided tour of the Colosseum? Yes, the Camp Nou is majestic, yes, the Barça DNA, positional play, and all that jazz. But the Champions League isn’t a stroll down Las Ramblas — it’s the Iliad: every match is an epic, and the gods — fickle as ever — love flipping the script right before the final note. And in this opera, the twist came from a character nobody saw coming.
Because watching Barça up 3–2 in the 89th minute, at San Siro, no less, felt like watching Achilles casually sipping tea. “It’s done,” you thought. Victory in hand, job well done. The Inter players looked half-dead, folded back like they knew how this was going to end. But there’s always a Hector ready to charge in — except this Hector was 37 years old, had beaten cancer twice, wrestled with alcohol and depression, and answered to the name Francesco Acerbi.
And this is where it gets good — and beautiful. Tancredi Palmieri told the story on The Iñaki Angulo Show with that mix of awe and disbelief: Inter, on the ropes, legs gone, out of breath — and suddenly… Acerbi! What the hell was he doing up there? Nobody knows. Inzaghi didn’t send him. There was no arrow on the tactics board saying “90th minute, Acerbi turns into last Roman standing.” Even his own teammates had no clue. Darmian summed it up in the mixed zone like a man still dazed: “Nobody told him to go up.”
And there he was. In the 90th minute, body probably screaming, Acerbi showed up in the box like a centurion who missed the retreat call, crashing through the chaos like an old wolf smelling blood in the fog. A loose ball, a single opening — and bang. With his foot, not his head. No flourish, no elegance — just pure grit. He struck it like a man who’d had enough. Goal. Barça stunned. San Siro exploding. Wojciech Szczęsny frozen like a marble statue watching history unfold.
Because Acerbi’s move wasn’t tactical. It was faith. Rebellion. A refusal to accept the script. That goal wasn’t a play — it was a soul cry. A man who’s stared death in the eye — the real kind, and the kind that creeps in silently — knew that some moments don’t wait for permission.
De Rossi nailed it: “Acerbi thought, this can’t happen to me.” And that right there? That’s not football anymore. That’s pure Nietzsche — the will to power. That raw, vital force that doesn’t just want to win, it wants to affirm life, to scream yes in the face of pain and limits and fading odds.
At 37, scarred more than stat-padded, Acerbi ignored the clock, the fatigue, the script — and rewrote the ending. A guy who’d never scored in the Champions League picked that moment to make his mark. As if to say, “I choose when this ends.”
In that improbable leap, in that lone-wolf instinct, the brutal beauty of sports came alive: the best don’t always win, but sometimes the most human do the impossible. And right there, in the chaos and the glory, a story was born. One Barça probably still doesn’t fully understand. But the rest of the football world does.

On April 28, I was in Barcelona, invited as an entrepreneurship scholar to give a talk at the University of Barcelona’s Business School (Thank you!). I thought it could be fun to have a seminar exploring the remake of business ideas — when it makes sense to repeat or revisit a business or creative concept, and when it’s better to radically innovate. I wanted to talk about how the world of movie remakes could reveal something deeper about entrepreneurship, creative industries, and innovation: that true novelty often doesn’t come from starting over, but from reinterpreting, adapting to new constraints, remixing old material with new needs. I had no idea how quickly the remake metaphor would become real.
Around mid-morning, just as I was about to start my seminar, the lights went out. At first, together with the scholars who had invited me, we thought it was a local glitch. Then the phones lost signal. The Wi-Fi stopped. People started saying this blackout was huge — we were in a state of emergency, the most significant infrastructure collapse in recent European memory. It hit all of Spain, Portugal, and parts of France. The thought that two entire countries had gone offline in broad daylight was deeply unsettling. People around me speculated — was it a cyberattack? Terrorism? Something tied to the war in Ukraine? But no one knew, and the uncertainty lasted until the very end of the outage.
Similar to the Northeast Blackout of 2003 in the Northeast U.S. and the Pakistan blackout of 2023, which impacted about 230 million people, this massive power outage hit a modern, hyper-digital society. Suddenly, there was no electricity. No mobile service. No buses, no metro, no trains. While people couldn’t easily move, I later discovered — sadly — that many had remained stuck in dark elevators. I saw that shop owners didn’t know how to close their stores, since most shutters today are electric. People walking through the streets stopped to help carry the weight of the shutters down, it was heartening to see that spirit.
I had to return to my temporary apartment to check whether the electric card system on the door still worked, I was not sure. It was about six kilometers away. With all transport paralyzed and taxis overwhelmed, I walked. Since traffic lights stopped working, the traffic was a bit erratic. I understood in my bones what system theorists mean when they say infrastructures are “invisible until they break”. Yet, drivers and pedestrians remained gentle with one another, intuitively creating a sense of flow.
At the apartment, the stairwell was completely dark, so I used my phone’s flashlight to see the steps. I was lucky, my apartment door still worked thanks to a battery system. That was a relief, even if I didn’t know how long the battery would last, or why a simple key option wasn’t implemented. Shouldn’t we always have a plan B when we design innovation?
Then, I immediately went to the only supermarket in the area that was still accepting cards. Yes, ATMs stopped working, and I hadn’t planned to use cash, just like thousands of others. Sadly, it felt like the bad old COVID days, with people buying water and toilet paper. Digging through the shelves, I was wondering when the light would come back (spoiler: it fully came back around 2 a.m., waking me up with all sorts of alarms — especially the fridge, which I didn’t even know had one!). I remembered I could buy candles, not just for their scent. But all I found were scented ones, I wondered why it’s so hard to keep products simple. I couldn’t find a lighter either, they were sold out. A young man from Albania handed me one as a gift, a beautiful moment of solidarity emerged. As I read later on Instagram, even Ursula von der Leyen noted that people responded with remarkable cooperation by taking care of one another. I want to echo this and highlight the incredible solidarity shown by the people of Spain during this difficult time.
Back at my apartment, I lit the candles, and I waited for good news. My balcony neighbors asked if I had an electric radio. Unfortunately, I didn’t. So, without TV or any means of communication, they got into their pajamas and went to sleep around 8:30 p.m., not exactly usual for Spain, I thought. The radio felt like a symbol of resilience, something simple, connecting people, low-tech but powerful. The night passed slowly, with no light at all — not even streetlights — until, at midnight, a few apartments lit up again and people started clapping, as if the near-apocalyptic event had passed. Since COVID, we don’t look the same, nor should we. Alertness runs higher now, and we’re deeply grateful when things return to normal.
Those twelve hours without electricity and any real way of knowing what was happening — a bit longer for me, since power returned at 2 a.m. in my apartment — made me realize something important in my field of study: we need to strategically design resilient innovation. We need more leaders and companies that help systems bend without breaking. This time, it happened in Spain and Portugal, but such crises can unfold anywhere in the world. Those hours left me with a few reflections I hope current and future managers or entrepreneurs will consider:
1. When traffic lights stop working, we realize how much we rely on invisible coordination. We often build business systems assuming continuous flow and passive compliance — electricity, broadband, logistics. But when those systems falter, we quickly learn which parts can adapt and self-correct. Organizations should not just scale; they must build resilience by developing structures that anticipate disruption, distribute decision-making, and maintain coherence under stress.
2. Elevators don’t lie: Many systems are not built to fail safely. Some people were trapped in elevators for hours, and that’s more than an inconvenience. Products and services shouldn’t be judged only by their performance under ideal conditions. They must be designed to fail well: to respond with agility and degrade gracefully, rather than collapse entirely.
3. Build trust like infrastructure, it’s one of your most resilient assets. I had to buy candles, but couldn’t light them until someone gave me a flame. At that moment, unexpected help reminded me that human connection is a fundamental offline resource. We talk about trust, community, and networks, but rarely as infrastructure. And yet, in moments of collapse, social capital performs better than hardware. Founders and company managers must build not only code, but networks of reciprocity, empathy, and trust.
4. Jolts reveal the innovation we need next. After the blackout, I noticed a few gaps: no offline modes in apps, elevators without battery backup, and solar panels that couldn’t power basic needs. But I also saw opportunity — local microgrids, edge networks, emergency communications, predictive tools, and emotionally aware crisis design. There’s a real need to stay informed when the internet goes down, and to open doors when the power fails. That means many products must include basic functions that work offline and in emergencies. These needs aren’t niche, they’re urgent.
5. Resilience is not the opposite of innovation, it is the future of innovation. I had planned my seminar around the concept of idea remakes — when and how we should reintroduce an old idea or product to the market. What I saw in Barcelona felt like a remake itself: you don’t always need to start from zero — you can adapt what you already have. Resilient systems are not frozen backups. They are active reimaginings. In a world of jolts, the remake isn’t lazy, it’s smart. Reinventing something today doesn’t just mean improving it. It means making sure it can quickly adapt when the world stops playing by the usual rules.
Hours without electricity and a mobile connection are unsettling, even in a beautiful city like Barcelona, which I hope to visit again soon. If you’ve never tried it, spend just six or seven hours without your phone, Wi-Fi, or smartwatch. Feel the isolation — notice what goes dark, and what unexpectedly lights up. Now that the power is back, I can more clearly see space for entrepreneurs and managers to rethink our approach to innovation.

My study abroad experience has undoubtedly been the most memorable quarter of my time at UW and one of the most transformative experiences in my life so far.
Through my classes, I’ve had the chance to observe the distinct teaching approaches in Spanish education. The country’s remarkable transportation system has allowed me to travel weekly, visiting destinations beyond Barcelona such as Madrid, Tarragona, and Granada. I even had the eye-opening opportunity to spend five days in Morocco with a school group, where I was immersed in a culture vastly different from my own.
The highlight of this journey has been my homestay with a local Spanish family, where I’ve been fully immersed in both the language and culture. Their incredible warmth has made me feel at home, and I feel my Spanish has improved significantly.
This experience has solidified my long-standing interest in a global career, strengthening my desire to pursue a path filled with international opportunities that will continue to fuel my curiosity and passion for cultural exploration.

This is a super‑brief review of my notes and some information from the talks I managed to attend.
Probably, nobody will be surprised by knowing that AI was part of many talks and conversations. I think we are all looking for the tasks and processes we can improve with AI, the ones that do not work well, and we are all curious about the future. But, as you’ll see, there was much more than AI.
Sarah‑Jane Madden reminded us that it’s not the first time we've been told that everything is changing. Through the years, we have had similar situations, and she stressed how important it is for security not to be late and to ensure that all the work we have done to be part of development from the very beginning is not wasted. We should be involved early because if we are not, we’ll go back to the same stage we were in the past, when it was too late to think about security.
Elliot Ward showed how LLMs are still not a good choice to look for vulnerabilities in code, but using an LLM to analyse results from SAST tools was a good option for triaging vulnerabilities. Elliot’s approach used an agent that took results from SARIF and output whether the finding was a false positive or not, and how confident it was about the result. The takeaway was that this helps, but we still get some false positives. Also, as mentioned in the talk, we’re seeing these agents already integrated by vendors in SAST tools.
As a break from LLMs, Aram Hovsepyan explained the Goal‑Question‑Metric framework and how good metrics answer meaningful questions. He analysed a few cases to see what makes a good metric and how it has to be precise, reliable, and valid, and how we are mixing metrics such as vulnerability types, CVSS, and EPSS when we shouldn’t. Last but not least, he showed clear examples of how a metric could lead us to think one way, but then seeing the data represented tells another story.
Rory McCune demonstrated how an attacker with privileged access to K8s will be really difficult to catch and clean. For example, by abusing APIs that are less well‑known and do not have audit logs. An example was how an attacker could use the CSR API to get a valid client certificate that can be used to authenticate against the cluster, and how difficult it was to revoke it. This doubled down on how important it is to keep clusters off the internet, and again, the importance of keeping permissions tight and audit logs enabled.
Javan Rasokat and Rico Komenda showed an LLM application threat model with potential threats such as prompt injection, poisoned data, and more. Then they mapped the defender side, noting that LLM risks are similar to the ones we already know for the web. There is also the shared‑responsibility model (that we know from the cloud), where part of the security is on the company behind the model, but another part is on the developer using it. They stressed the importance of validation both on input and output, and mentioned a cool open‑source firewall
I finished Day 1 with Paul Schwarzenberger’s demo of the OWASP Domain Protect Project. He showed common mistakes that can leave a domain vulnerable to account takeover and how the project can alert on vulnerable domains and even take preventative actions, such as creating resources (s3 bucket, for example) so attackers or bug‑bounty hunters don’t grab them first.
Kate Labunets highlighted the difficulties of collaboration between academia and the corporate world, showing how the ways of working and objectives are different. The takeaway for me was that this collaboration is going to help everyone, but both sides should make changes or adapt for it to work better.
Spyros Gasteratos explained why the way most teams orchestrate tools via dirty scripts doesn’t scale and how important interoperability is (open standards such as SARIF but most importantly OCSF). Short feedback loops are also crucial, otherwise, you’ll detect a tool not working when it’s too late. To help, he presented smithy, a Go tool that helps automate security team frameworks.
The great Tanya Janca delivered an excellent presentation, sharing what can go wrong in security‑champion programmes and offering practical solutions. Her talk showed the many complexities in these programmes and how they need a lot of work to be successful. While the OWASP talk wasn’t recorded, you can watch her NDC {Security} version and view the OWASP slides with the extra research. If you are building or planning to build a Security Champion program, you must read or watch this.
Two great talks overlapped: Rami McCarthy’s “Scale Security Programs with Scorecarding” and Karim El‑Melhaoui & Håkon Sørum’s “Abusing Misconfigurations in CI/CD to Hijack Apps and Clouds.” I’m a HUGE fan of Rami, but CI/CD security was a higher priority for me, so I chose Karim and Håkon. ( I also knew the guys from O3C wouldn’t disappoint, and they didn’t)
They showed that CI/CD pipelines have become a critical yet often overlooked attack surface. Also, how often they have privileged access to a cloud account, and how simple configuration errors can lead to disaster. To illustrate attacker reach from a compromised CI/CD, they presented an open‑source tool that, BloodHound‑style, uses a Neo4j graph to map everything an attacker could access starting from a compromised GitHub repository.
Tal Folkman made me even more paranoid about supply‑chain attacks, demonstrating how a dev testing a malicious model (from Hugging Face) could be compromised or how a trained code‑completion model could add malicious code without the developer noticing (the example showed the payload being added after a lot of spaces and not visible in the IDE).
If I started the conference with Elliot Ward and how AI was helping with SAST triage, I ended with Murat Zhumagali and AI‑driven threat modelling. Using AWS Bedrock models (for privacy reasons), he built a workflow that pulls Jira info and returns a well‑formatted list of threats. It’s super interesting to see how the new models are delivering much better results, even though the accuracy isn’t 100 %, it’s already reaching really good levels.
The conference was super great, but having so many great talks happening at the same time, and not being recorded, was frustrating.

Restaurants I ate at recently and where I’m heading next

Eating our way through Disfrutar, Bar Canete, Mont Bar, and more
I made our reservation at Disfrutar a year in advance. Literally 365 days. Right before San Pellegrino ranked it the 2024 best restaurant in the world. We planned a whole trip to Europe around this lunch. However, making that reservation was actually the easy part. The hard part was deciding where to eat our other meals. The options were overwhelming, but I ultimately made some hard choices, and I’m mostly happy with my picks.
I’ll cut to the chase — this restaurant was worth the trip!
PROS: The food was exactly as I’d hoped it would be. It was creative, delicious, and fun. It was surprising, but not too weird or serious. One of my favorite things about high-end Spanish dining is how joyful and playful chefs are with their food. We laughed and tried on chocolate rings and exploded walnut shells all over the table and cleaned our hands with water drops shaken out of a red rose. We ate caviar on top of a butter cloud and inside of a doughy bun, spherical-I olives, and golden eggs. We left stuffed, but not painfully so. It’s not the best meal I’ve ever had, but it’s fully deserving of being in the same category as San Pellegrino’s other best restaurants in the world. It’s a much more casual experience vs. something like Noma (which feels like a special event every step of the way), and it’s closer to the El Bulli style with innovative food in an unexpected setting. While I leave most fancy meals thinking one time was enough, this is a meal that I’d actually want to eat again soon. I’m including more photos at the bottom of this post.
CONS: Just two gripes…
(1) When we first arrived, I was horrified that they sat us at one of the two worst tables in the restaurant located in the entry hallway instead of in the dining room. Those two tables should not be used for regular bookings. I feel bad for the staff who have to disappoint two groups at every seating by showing them to these tables. I was worried the lack of atmosphere was going to ruin the whole meal, but luckily, it ended up allowing us to focus more on the food.
(2) The sommelier did not know their wine list and was unable to give a recommendation for a Spanish wine Chablis drinkers might enjoy. Later in the meal, he suggested a second bottle that did not pair well with the richer, hearty final courses. I’d expect more at a restaurant of this caliber. However, the rest of the team provided excellent service.
While the trip was planned around Disfrutar, we certainly didn’t go hungry for our other meals…
Mont Bar — World-class fine dining in a bar
I’m so sad that this restaurant isn’t in San Francisco, because I would eat here regularly if I could. Since reservations for Disfrutar are so impossible, this is the restaurant that I will recommend to everyone I know. They manage to strike a unique balance between a fancy special occasion restaurant and an informal tapas spot (they self describe as “fine dining in a bar”). The restaurant is tiny with space for about 20 people. Most diners are eating the tasting menu or creating their own tasting menu like we did. When I read the menu online, I was worried that the combinations of ingredients were going to be too unusual, but everything came together beautifully. We all agreed the chicken skin squid canape was our favorite bite of the night, but we also loved the sea bass ceviche, mochi with sobrasada, and tuna belly. The nori seaweed and caviar ice cream sandwich was a wonderfully weird way to end the night.
Berbena — Hip newcomer, still finding its footing
The vibe of this restaurant was perfect. It was upscale but casual, with an open kitchen and a small dining area that was full, but not too cramped. The waiters had a warm style, and it felt like they were all friends and you got to be their friend for the night too. They did a great job offering us a range of wine options based on our preferences. The food menu was interesting and diverse, but only had a few standout dishes. You must order the bread with sides (sliced ham and butter), the tapioca & cheddar dadinho (delightful texture and cheesy taste) and all the desserts. Somehow I did not take pictures of any of the best dishes! The vegetables and main courses were all underwhelming, but I would go back again in a different season since the menu changes regularly.
Bar Canete — Old school tapas, worth the hype
I was worried this famous spot would be full of tourists, and it was — but I still loved it (supposedly the locals arrive around 10pm). You’ll have to force your way to the front of a crowd to check in with the host, but as long as you have a reservation they operate efficiently. We were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation. The waiter was high energy and funny and helped steer us towards all the best dishes. We ordered way too much, but I’m glad we didn’t miss the tuna tartar, steak with foie gras, or crema catalana.

Barcelona — Zaragoza — San Sebastian — Cudillero — A Coruña — Madrid — Valencia.
This November I turned 30 years old and decided to celebrate it with my friend Eugene, traveling across Spain. Though I grew up in the far east of Russia, it was a long awaited return to a place where, five years ago, I lived and studied. Spain is also a place that I once called my “foreign homeland.”
After landing in Barcelona, we rented a car, named it “Pepe,” and embarked on our Spanish journey. Throughout the trip we visited seven cities in seven different Spanish regions, going from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coast and back to the southeast of Spain.
Here are some personal impressions of the places we visited.
We arrived in Spain during the pinnacle of a political conflict: “Catalonia v. Spain“ — a perennial debate that has engulfed the region, culminating in Catalonia’s recent independence vote. The day we landed there was a demonstration in favor of a unified Spain in la Plaza de Ayuntamiento de Barcelona. Semi-sober protesters, draped in Spanish flags, were yelling, singing, drinking and dancing in favor of not dividing the country into two.
The following day we went to listen to Estrella Morente’s heart-touching voice. The widely renowned star of Spain’s traditional flamenco music headlined a concert at the iconic Palau de la Musica in Barcelona with her band. While purchasing the tickets I asked the woman at the box office if she liked Señorita Morente. The attendant charmingly looked at me and said, “Of course. She’s the most important singer…from a country that is next to us.”
In Zaragoza, in the Aragon region in between Barcelona on the south coast and San Sebastián, near the French border on the north coast, I met up with my friend Nick, a photographer who recently moved with his family from New York City to a small village near Lleida in Catalonia.
Nick said that after living in New York he feels way more relaxed in Spain. He’s discovered a new lifestyle. Life on the outskirts has its own advantages, including fresh food and a chill vibe, but also its flaws, namely a lack of art that is vital for the nourishment of any artist. Nick loves the region and terribly misses his work, photographing people and making portraits. Gladly, he brought his camera to our luncheon and we did a few shots in the streets of Zaragoza. Ever since meeting Nick in New York a year ago, I’ve considered him my photo inspiration. Every time I face his camera we get lost in the collaborative process and find creative images together.
Barcelona is my favorite city and the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. Or so I thought until I re-discovered San Sebastian, a resort town that is located near the French border on the north coast. Six years ago I visited but I don’t know how I failed to fully appreciate all of its beauty. Walking the streets of the old city and experiencing the sunset from atop a mountain was perhaps was one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve had — ever.
While wandering around San Sebastián, I happened upon a local bakery in town where I randomly met an 18 year old young kid from Guatemala. We sat for coffee and talked. Our surface conversation led us a to a deeper level, sharing personal stories. He told me that his parents found out that he is gay and did not take it so well. He turned sad when talking about his family and said that he didn’t want to have contact with them anymore. He left his home and rented a small room in this city. Now he goes to college in the morning and works at the bakery in the evening. He dreams of being a model and a flight attendant. I was amazed by his strength and focus at such a young age. I was touched by his coming out story. He reminded me of myself and my own.
In Cudillero, a small village in the northwest of Spain, we rode horses for a stroll through the rugged forest to observe the sea from the top of the mountains. It was one of the most therapeutic experiences I’ve had. The beauty and harmony of green Asturian nature mixed with the rhythm and sound of the horse’s hoofs created a sense of pure bliss.
Right before we began the afternoon journey, a small dog approached me. Her fur was matted and messy from the rain, and, she had sad gaze. I caressed the dog and said, “hello.” She was friendly and even with a coat that could use a brushing, quite cute. Five minutes later, as we mounted our horses and made our way to the main road to start the trail into the woods, our guide, Jesus, noticed that the dog was laying on the grass along the narrow road. The dog was dead.
Although we didn’t see what happened, probably a passing car hit the dog. She belonged to Jesus’s co-worker and Jesus started to weep deeply. Tears of sorrow also struck my own heart. It made me think of life and instant death. Five minutes ago I was caressing a dog and looking into her eyes and then …bah… and the soul is gone.
A few days later we went to see Goya’s “Black Paintings” in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Among all of them there was one that grabbed my full attention. Perhaps I would not have been so struck by it if it had not been for the recent accident. The painting, called “Drowning Dog,” represented fatality and mortality. I still keep thinking about it — the painting, the dog and the message.
In A Couña, a port city in the Galician region, I had the most delicious Pulpo a la Gallega. In general, food all over Spain is fantastic. I could eat cheese with bread and drink wine endlessly, as long as its Spanish. The cuisine embraces the pure art of a simple food. No need to go to a fancy restaurant approved by magazines, or entitled with the stars. Just stop by a local bar and ask for un pincho de tortilla con un cortado. Simple and easy … and damn good!
My new acquaintance Davide commented that if you are born in Galicia you have to say that you are Gallego, not Spaniard. In some areas of Galicia if you, as a Gallego, proclaim yourself a Spaniard first, “you might be beaten up,” he said. Two other friends from Galicia were in total disagreement with Davide’s statement when I shared it with them.
Traveling through Spain we faced, on several occasions, statements from people proclaiming their regional pride. Throughout Cataluña we heard how proud people are to be Catalan first, and later in Cudillero, locals expressed pride at being born in Asturias region, then in A Coruña, in Spain’s far corner above Portugal, girlfriends of mine did not let us buy them lunch proclaiming, Vamos a pagar nosotros porque somos chicas Gallegas (We will pay for ourselves, because we are Galician girls)!
Later in Valencia, south of Madrid and back on the Mediterranean coast, people speak Valenciano and feel deeply rooted in their language and its preservation. It was interesting to observe how one single country is so diversely separated by it own dialect, food, language, culture and economics. People throughout the nation persistently point out these differences. It felt foreign as coming from Russia, it never occurred to me, nor any of my friends, to proudly declare that we are from a specific region.
I turned 30 between day and and night somewhere on the road between Madrid and Valencia. I was driving a car, accompanied by an exceptionally beautiful sunset that scattered around the sky and minute by minute as if it were a perfectly composed playlist, changing colors as if they were tracks of music, from mild light blue to loud poisoning red to eventually calm and quiet dim orange. It felt deeply symbolic, driving forward towards new experience without looking back.
Heraclitus once said, ”No man ever steps into the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.“ The more I age the more I get it.
In 2010 I came to Valencia from my home country of Russia to get my Masters degree. I studied Communication at the University of Valencia and graduated in 2012. When I got a job offer in New York City, I left Spain. Needless to say, I felt quite emotional coming back after five years of separation.
The morning after we arrived, I was showing my friend Eugene my favorite places where I spent the best times of my youth. I took him through the river from the City of Arts and Science to the Old City and the City Center. On bikes, we rode to my language school where I studied Spanish, and I wandered through the halls of my university and somehow found myself in the cafeteria. I recall that I was always hungry during that time and looked at the faculty terrace and saw students smoking in groups and chatting about university life sitting on the stairs. I did exactly the same a half decade ago.
It felt surreal.
We greeted the sunset atop Torres de Serrano, where the old town starts. If you climb the stairs of the tower you can observe a spectacular view of the city. At the top there was one young guy playing guitar and one girl clapping in the rhythm of flamenco. The sound of the music, the towers, and the sunset all together were so harmonic that I could not help but dance.
My trip ended in Valencia. Eugene left for the U.S. and I stayed in the city for a few more days meeting new people, discovering and rediscovering old friends and simply walking around Valencia, absorbing the Spanish air, voices, smells and sights. It made me realize that I fell in love with Spain — again. Or perhaps my Spanish romance never stopped, it just took a five year break.
I hope our long distance relationship will continue to develop in some way no matter how far we are from each other.
Traveling by car across the country is the best way to discover Spain. Our car “Pepe” took us from the south all the way through the north and back to the south, more than 2,100 km. Spanish highways are high-end!
Barcelona — Sail the Mediterranean with Enric and see the city from the sea boathttps://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Barcelona-Fun-Sailing/members/204961128/
Zaragoza — It’s impossible to avoid passing it but Basilica del Pilar is an astonishing architectural legacy.
San-Sebastian — Among of the best Pinxos I tried were here at Atari Gastroteka. Calle Mayor 18
Cudillero — Climb to the mirador and take a look at the village from above. It worth it to travel all the way there just to see the view with your own eyes.
A Coruña — Have lunch at Pulperia de Melide ask for Pulpo a la gallega — OMG — this Octopus with potatoes was EVERYTHING. You can not imagine.
Madrid — Dine at Sobrino de Botin — one of the oldest restaurants in the city founded in 1725. Calle Cuchilleros 17
Valencia — Cozy atmosphere, tasty coffee and way too tasty pastries are at coffee shop Dulce de Leche. You can sit there forever and it’s not going to be enough. A place I always want to come back. Carrer de Pintor Gispert 2

Before we went to Barcelona, we thought that Boulder, Colorado, north of Denver, might be the world’s dog-loving capital. In Boulder, you can take your dog practically everywhere, and people do. They’re in restaurants and grocery stores, running alongside their bike-riding owners, playing in dog parks, and going on walks. According to one website, there are 15,000 dogs in Boulder, and one out of three households has a dog.
Then, after our 10 days there, I had to believe that Barcelona residents had to love dogs more. There were dogs everywhere we went.
Imagine my surprise when I looked on Google to discover that neither Boulder nor Barcelona is the biggest dog-loving city. There are lots of cities with more dogs per capita, including Houston, Seattle, Bern, Budapest, and others, including Paris and Denver. But I have to wonder if this website is truly up-to-date.
Barcelona may not be the biggest dog-loving city listed on Google, still perhaps it’s the city that cleans up after its dogs the best.
Only once in 10 days did we encounter squished dog poop on the sidewalk, unlike in Paris, where you have to watch where you step, even in the nicer neighborhoods…

What does it look like when the idea of care as a practice that sustains life, communities, and cities is considered in an urban context? How can this idea be used to inform projects and planning interventions? Those were some of the questions we brought with us to Barcelona (Spain) where we have been conducting fieldwork this week. Today, we completed our visit as part our ongoing research into care-informed urban planning. The project titled “Care-Informed Urban Planning: Learnings and Exchange Across Countries and Sectors” aims is to generate insights into how care ethics are operationalised in the context of planning and urban governance in selected cases. The insights, exchanges, and warm welcomes we encountered in Barcelona have left us both intellectually energised.
Barcelona is truly intriguing. It is a city that is not shying away from pioneering projects, programs, and interventions informed by ideas around inclusion, Ethics of Care, and feminism. We learned that the Barcelona City Council has set up the Area for Feminisms and Equality, a department with a commitment to gender equality, has established the Councillor’s Office for Feminism and LGBTI Affairs and set up a Gender Impact Assessment (GIAs) tool used in policymaking processes, particularly in urban planning and budgeting. These initiatives are part of Barcelona’s broader Gender Justice Plan, aiming to work on inequality through proximity and diversity and reflect a broader commitment to feminist municipalism, integrating equality into urban governance and public policy.
During our fieldwork, we aimed to understand and gain a clearer perspective on how considerations about care are integrated into urban governance. We are incredibly grateful for the warm welcome and generous engagement we received from everyone who we spoke with.
Barcelona has a rich and dynamic approach to urban governance, where multiple actors are involved in shaping living environments. Care concerns seem to be informing many activities of urban governance. We had the chance to learn more about a range of innovative interventions that make care visible and actionable within the urban fabric.
These include the time use initiative, climate refuges, the justice-based approach to culture, Vila Veïna, and the city’s superblocks (in Esp. superilles). Most of these initiatives are run at the neighbourhood level, and a common thread across these efforts is the idea that care is not just a private matter confined to the home. Instead, care is increasingly recognised as a collective, social, and spatial issue. It is an issue that belongs in the public domain. And as such, it deserves institutional recognition, public investment, professional expertise, and spaces for diverse voices to be heard, especially those historically underrepresented in traditional planning processes.
We’re leaving Barcelona inspired and full of ideas and reflections. Thank you to all those who shared their time, knowledge, and reflections with us.
With gratitude,Romina & Miriam

“Gun store, liquor store, gun store… Where the fuck you taking me!?!” -Dave Chappelle (Killing Em’ Softly)
April 12, 2006
My 3 cabinmates were far lamer than the ones from my other long train trip, so I drank in the bar car by myself and bit my nails until I was drunk enough to pass out. My dad bit his nails too, and I’ve always been extremely embarrassed of the habit as a result. It’s just so hard to quit a drug you grow yourself.
When I woke up, we were in the French countryside, which had no graffiti, but was still quite beautiful, with its’ rolling hills, herds of sheep, and never-ending rows of grapes to be transformed to wine.
That reminds me of a Mitch Hedberg joke…
“I saw this wino, he was eating grapes. I was like dude you have to wait.”
I could feel the temperature, and the moods of the passengers change as soon as we crossed the border into Spain and saw the sea. Only the sea, or maybe a bucket of Xanax, can calm an anxious crowd of travelers so quickly. Anticipation turned to relaxation, as we watched the waves crash into the shore. Redemption was in the air, and I was more than ready for mine.
Stepping off the train, I felt like Uma Thurman in Pulp fiction when she takes the shot of adrenaline to her heart. I was born anew, my past mistakes forgiven. The Berghain, the prostitute, the near arrests… Those mishaps were soon to be a thing of the past. Barcelona, I told myself, would be my travel baptism.
My hostel was only a short walk from the train, and when I got there, I was impressed. It was very much righton the beach. The sand reached the entrance. There were a few guys drinking outside with their shirts off. One of them had a brindle hound he let me pet. Everything was falling right into place.
I was greeted warmly by the manager, who, to my surprise, bought me a beer while I waited for the room to be cleaned — a fine protocol, if you ask me. As soon as my room was ready, I threw on my shorts, along with the flip flops I’d been using to shower, and headed for the beach with my book in tow. On the way, I stopped in a little shop, which looked very much like a New York bodega, and bought a few 20oz Heineken cans. I had my book, my cigs, and my drinks. I was set until dinner.
There were only about 100 people peppered along the beach, most of them drinking in small cliques. I found an isolated area and made myself comfortable. I was almost done with my book and had every intention of finishing it that day.
As soon as I fixed my eyes on the page though, I heard a voice, an American sounding one, holler in my direction.
Guy: What book are you reading?
I looked up and saw three men walking towards me. The one leading the way was pale and gruff looking, maybe 35 years old, with a mullet. He was wearing jeans and a jean jacket.
Me: Hunter Thompson. Ever heard of him?
Guy: No. It sure is big though.
Me: Yep, lots of words.
Guy: Are you making fun of me?
Me: No, not at all. I’m Sam. Here, have a beer. I have one more if you fellas don’t mind sharing.
Guy: Sure, we can share. My name is John. That’s Carlos, and that’s Aaron.
I pulled the remaining two beers out of my bag and tossed them their way.
This was my thinking… Here we had three odd strangers who had been nothing but nice thus far, though I was sensing some odd undercurrents. So, I made a generous offer of friendship, one that would allow me to gather additional information from a position of kindness and generosity, as opposed to weary skepticism. That approach has gotten me far in life. The other benefit was that I was now out of my remaining beers and had an excuse to leave our soiree as soon as my can ran dry. Not bad, right?
Aaron was about 30 years old and didn’t talk so I couldn’t determine where he was from. His skin was weathered from the sun, his blue tank top tattered from years of wear. He wreaked of beer like he’d been drinking for two straight days. And he seemed a bit touched, but that could have been the result of a sun-soaked bender. It was hard to tell.
Carlos looked to be about 20 years old. He was quiet, with dark skin and a 90’s bowl cut. I could tell he was much more innocent than the other two. I assumed he was a local but couldn’t be sure. [SR1]
Both guys gestured towards me but none of us shook hands. We were a crew now, whether I liked it or not. At least until my beer ran out.
John: We need more beer.
He flipped his can over to show me he’d finished it.
I thought, “FUUUUCK, that was remarkably fast,” realizing the trap I’d fallen into. It was now becoming clear that they were homeless people, and John was the leader of the crew. He had me in his sights. I was the mark, and he was going to work me for as much as he could. I scrambled for an out but came up with nothing, so I went along. What were they going to do, kill me after I’d given them beer?
Me: Ok, I’ll go grab a few more.
John: Wait, I’ll come with you.
Me: It’s just right there. I can —
John: I’m coming. Let’s go.
We walked 2 blocks to the store I’d previously been in and grabbed four of the same 20oz. Heineken cans. As I approached the counter, I saw John talking to the clerk, who was handing him a pint of Jack Daniels from the shelf behind the register.
John: Let’s get this too. And some Cheetos. I haven’t had Puffs in like 15 years.
I thought, “What the fuck does he mean by that? Was he away somewhere? WHY WOULD HE NOT HAVE HAD CHEETOS IN SO LONG?”.
Me: Yeah, fine, just total it up. But that’s it. I need have dinner soon and I can’t get that drunk.
I lied. That was exactly my plan.
John: Sure. Of course. You’ll get to your dinner.
John held the bag as we walked back to the beach. We’d only just exchanged names, and I was already 30 Euros in the hole. What little leverage I had was gone.
John: Sam got us food and drinks!
Everyone rejoiced, except me. John pulled the bottle of Jack out and took a big swig, handing it to me after.
John: Here, have some.
Me: Oh, no. I’m good. I don’t even like Jack that much.
John: You’re not going to drink with me…?
Me: I mean, I bought it. That must count for something, no?
John: Still, rude.
I took the bottle and wiped the mouthpiece.
Me: (sarcastically) Is that rude too?
I took a swig and looked back at John. For the first time I noticed the burn marks around his mouth. He saw me staring.
John: Don’t worry, they’re burns, not herpes.
Me: That’s good… Or bad… I’m not sure what you want me to say.
John: My parents burned me.
I ignored him, hoping the subject would change, or a plane would fall out of the sky and crush us all into mush.
John: That’s why I killed them.
I looked up hoping to see the plane. Nothing. Carlos and Aaron were still sitting silently, sharing their beer. They didn’t even look particularly bothered or uncomfortable. All just terrible, terrible signs.
John: I’m not joking, I killed them both.
Me: I believe you. No disagreements here.
John: You can Google it when you get back to your hostel.
He pointed to my hostel, which he’d apparently seen me come from. Another awful sign.
Me: No need. I believe you.
John: Seriously. Give me your book.
He reached out and snatched the book from me, removing the pen I used as a bookmark. He opened it to the last page. That’s when I noticed his nails. They were caked in weeks’ worth of sand and dirt, and there were sores everywhere. He handed me the book back and I looked down at it. It read: “John _____.”
John: Just Google that name and the word “murder,” and it’ll come right up.
Me: Gotcha. Will do. Thanks John.
Just as I slunk back down into the sand, John took another swig of Jack Daniels and yelled, “Hey, check this out!” before tackling Aaron to the ground. It quickly escalated to a fight. People were looking on, but no one seemed to care enough to jump in. People don’t really break up homeless people fights, do they?
Sitting next to Carlos, away from the other two, I tried to gather more intel. Unfortunately, Carlos barely spoke any English. I had some experience from high school and working in kitchens so I did what I could with what I had.
Me: Los conoces?
Carlos: Los conoci hoy.
Apparently, Carlos had just met John and Aaron that day. “What the fuck is going on here?” I asked myself, “I thought they were a roaming band of brothers.” I knew what I had to do at that point; I needed to separate Carlos and I from the murderer(s) before we met a similar fate.
Me: Quiero escaper de ellos conmigo?
I asked him if he wanted to escape with me.
Carlos: Si.
I looked over at John and Aaron. They were still fighting, now even closer to the shoreline, about 100 feet away. I slowly started to gather my stuff, leaving the Cheetos and booze behind as to not raise suspicions.
I looked at Carlos. Surprisingly, we seemed to have an understanding.
Me: Sigueme.
He followed me and we walked as nonchalantly as possible, too scared to glance back. I picked up the pace once we hit the cobblestone road.
Me: Only, 20 more paces. Please, God, don’t let that murderer turn around.
We rounded the corner together then peeked back. John still had Aaron in a headlock. They were all twisted up. We were safe. Carlos looked at me and we both sighed. Then we broke out into laughter, delirious from the fear. Or at least that’s why I was laughing. I wasn’t sure why he was, given he probably didn’t understand John’s admission. I thought about trying to explain it to him in Spanglish but decided against it. Hell, I didn’t even want to know.
The Adderall was wearing off, and I still wanted shellfish, so, in a giant leap of faith, I asked Carlos out to dinner. There I go again.
Me: Tienes hambre? Voy a pagar.
I offered to pay.
Carlos: Por que, no?
He was in.
We walked down a street parallel to the beach, trying to get to know each other. From what I gathered; he was homeless. He was a mechanic by trade, but currently not working. He used to stay with his mother, but that bridge had burned. The only thing he’d eaten that day were the Cheetos.
He spoke pridefully, not seeming to have been broken by the world yet. He had a confident smile and looked me directly in my eyes when he addressed me. That’s always important. He’d lived a lot of life for a 20-year-old but seemed up for the fight.
We passed a couple of oceanfront restaurants before I chose one with a patio that opened to a small dock. It was a lovely place, perhaps too lovely for some underdressed fellas like us. Regardless, we were welcomed in without judgement.
Have you ever seen the scene in The Wire where Bunny Colvin takes the corner kids to Ruth’s Chris, and they don’t know how to behave because of the culture shock? When Carlos accidentally shattered a wine glass, I felt like Bunny, conducting a misguided social experiment. Who was it all for, me or Carlos?
When Carlos came back from cleaning and bandaging his thumb, I ordered us a variety of shellfish, along with a paella to share. I figured we might as well fill our bellies regardless of the awkwardness. And that we did. For the next hour we sat in relative silence, stuffing our faces like garbage-can racoons. The food couldn’t have been better, same as the wine, which I continued to order until there was nothing left on our plates, three bottles in total.
Drunk and extremely full, I paid the waiter and thanked him repeatedly for putting up with us. Then, we exited towards the beach.
That would have been a good time to end the night, I know. But then, I did what I always do.
Me: Donde esta la mota?
Of course, I asked him to find me weed. I knew it was risky, but I was almost out and still had enough Adderall to last for 2 weeks. I needed it. That’s the problem with balancing drugs; if you don’t have enough of one, you can’t fully enjoy the other. I know, it’s madness.
Carlos: Si, Seguro. Necesitamos un taxi.
I got us a taxi and Carlos gave the driver directions.
We drove for much longer than I expected, almost 30-minutes, all of which I spent rationalizing the situation. “Maybe this is where the best weed is? Yeah, that’s probably it… Carlos won’t set you up, you just bought him the meal of a lifetime… At least you have a knowledgeable liaison if things go sideways…”
When we pulled up to our destination, I knew I was in trouble. There were large brick buildings, with bars on the windows, and a centralized courtyard. It was a fucking housing project. Carlos took me to the goddamn projects. Granted, I didn’t tell him the projects were off limits, but for fuck’s sake.
When I exited the car, everyone loitering in front of the building turned to me. They pointed and laughed at my pale legs. I must have looked like an alien to them. My confidence was shot.
Carlos: (hand out) Treinta Euros.
I went in my pocket and gave him the money. He placed it in his underwear and took off into the housing projects.
Me: (sarcastically, to no one) I guess I’ll just chill here with my new friends.
I waited out front of the building, pacing back and forth, smoking cigs, trying to think of an exit plan in case the situation went even more haywire. I popped another 10mg of Adderall too, realizing the night may still be young. A few guys yelled things at me in Spanish, but no one seemed like they wanted to take it to the next level. Still, I was so fucking paranoid.
Then I saw Carlos. He came out of the building with his thumb up and motioned for me to follow. When we got to a more secluded area, he pulled the goods out of his underwear. I was relieved to see a plastic baggie filled with approximately 3.5 grams of green, seedless weed.
Me: WOW! Great job Carlos.
Carlos: De nada, amigo.
He handed me the weed, then pulled a joint from his pocket. I was happy that he didn’t pull it from his pants, but I was confused. “Did he have it the whole time? Was it a freebie from the drug dealer?”.
Before I could contemplate any longer, Carlos lit the joint, took a hit, and passed it to me. I took a hit too and immediately started coughing. I took another hit and did the same. The taste was weird and it made a crackling sound with each puff. “Huh, never seen that happen beeeefffooooor.”
It was at this point I realized that, to my surprise, I was not smoking weed. I was smoking angel dust. The hallucinations started almost instantly. I could barely stand. Carlos, realizing that I was unstable, came to my aid.
Me: Whaaaat wwwaaasss thaaaat?
He leaned in closer, his arm propping me up.
Carlos: I kiss?
His question half-sobered me. Then he leaned in further, his lips pursed.
Carlos: I kiss?
I pushed him away.
Me: No! You do not kiss!!! What the fuck?!
He was pissed. I turned and ran as fast as I could toward the main road where we’d entered the housing project. I looked back and saw Carlos chasing me, screaming at the top of his lungs like a madman.
Carlos: I kiss! I kiss!
I jumped in the first taxi I saw. Carlos was only 40 feet behind us and gaining speed. In my state, it looked like there were 2 of him.
Me: (to driver) VA! VA! VA!
Driver: Tranquillo, senor.
Carlos: (banging on the window) Kiss!! Kiss!!
Me: (to driver) Tranquillo!?! FUCKING DRIVE. VAAAAAAAAA!!
The driver took off and fearfully sped away with Carlos still sprinting behind us. I looked back at him, my heart pounding. He was feral.
Me: Sea Hostel, por favor, y lo siento.
He looked at me quizzically in the rear-view mirror, I think because he assumed I was skipping out on a prostitute without paying. I’m not sure, but it was certainly a look of judgment.
We rode in silence, the cabbie alternating his gaze between me and the road. I kept checking my pulse but lost count of the beats every time my eyes fixated on the bright lights outside my window. I was still hallucinating, but I was at least beginning to calm down.
I had the driver drop me off a few blocks away from my hostel so I could scope out the area before entering. I needed to make sure John wasn’t waiting for me out front to knife me. I wouldn’t have put it passed him. I mean, he slept on the beach only a few hundred feet away and knew I’d be returning at some point.
High out of my mind, I tiptoed quietly up to the front door and slid in. The front desk person saw me and looked concerned.
Guy: Are you ok? Is someone after you?
Me: I think I’m high on PCP. Long story… If a guy named John comes looking for me, tell him I went to Portugal.
Guy: Umm… Ok. How come?
Me: Do me a favor. Please Google “J-O-H-N, _-_-_-_-_-_-_ , M-U-R-D-E-R”
Guy: Why?
Me: I just want to see something.
Guy: It says he killed his parents when he was 16. Do you know him?
Me: May I please check out?
*
April 13, 2006
The next morning, I woke up feeling like I’d recently smoked PCP and almost made out with a homeless person, which I had, so before eating, I walked a mile to a more private beach and plunged myself into the ocean for a literal baptism. Like Lady McBeth though, no matter how hard I scrubbed, the stain of the previous night wouldn’t come out. In 18 hours, I’d managed to turn my PG-rated redemption story into an R-rated horror film. I’d missed the mark, by A LOT. I needed to get my act together and stop trusting everyone. And I definitely needed to stop hanging out with vagrants. I’ve always had a penchant for hanging out with homeless people. I remember going to a Bar Mitzvah in downtown Chicago when I was 13, and instead of dancing inside with everyone, I took a 2-hour walk around the city and mixed it up with homeless people. Spiritually, I relate. I think it’s the pain that attracts me. Or maybe it’s because I too cannot hold down a job.
Breakfast went down, then came right up, like I assumed it would, so I went to the same shop I did the previous day to get some Tums. The same clerk was working.
Me: Have you seen the guy I was with yesterday again today?
Clerk: John?
Me: You know him?
Clerk: He’s in here every day.
Me: Have you seen him today?
Clerk: (Smiling mischievously) Not yet.
Then, I felt a hand touch my shoulder.
John: Sam! Where’d you go yesterday? You and Carlos just ran off.
Me: I wasn’t sure how long you and Aaron would be fighting, so we went out to dinner.
John: You didn’t invite me?
Me: Sorry, man.
John: Did you Google me?
Me: I did. You weren’t lying.
John: Lying is a sin.
Me: I’m going to take off now.
John: Where to next?
Me: Portugal. Then Russia.
John: Well, it was nice meeting you. You mind buying me some more Jack before you go?
Me: Um… sure.
I paid the cashier, like the pushover I am.
John: Carlos is on the beach, you want to say hi?
Me: No. I gotta go. Madrid awaits.
John: Don’t you mean Portugal?
Me: That’s right, Portugal.
John: You’re not lying, are you?
Me: No, I meant Portugal. I’m going to Portugal.
John: Remember, lying is a sin.
Me: Ok, I’m going to Madrid. My train leaves tonight.
I lied again.
John: Don’t worry, I’m not going to follow you.
Me: Uh, good. It was nice meeting you.
I lied again.
John: Same.
I left the store and booked it to the train station without looking back. Madrid, I thought, was where I’d have to find my redemption.

Five years ago, I was fortunate to be leading the team within Metaswitch that launched Project Calico, a revolutionary approach to network virtualization. Not long after, we founded Tigera as a stand-alone startup focused on commercializing Calico and addressing the network security challenges introduced by cloud native architectures.
They say one year is seven dog years. There’s probably a similar ratio when it comes to Silicon Valley Startup Years. I certainly feel like I have learned a couple of decades of lessons as founding CEO and more recently VP Business Development at Tigera. How to balance supporting an open source community and building a commercially successful business; recruit a world class executive team; maintain a relentless focus on execution; foster an ecosystem of mutually beneficial partnerships; and ultimately the immense satisfaction in seeing something you incubated from the germ of an idea to a de facto industry standard adopted practically across the board by all the major cloud providers, vendors, and major enterprise users.
So it probably comes as a surprise to many that I would consider leaving Tigera at this point in its journey. The fact is that I have also gained some wisdom over the past few years, such as: family comes first; there are dreams we have which are more important than pursuing a singular company vision; and building a deep executive bench inevitably means no one individual (including any one founder) is as critical to the company as they were in the beginning.
For a long time, my wife, two children and I have lived in Berkeley, California, but wanted to live for an extended period in Europe — Germany specifically, as our children grew up bi-culturally (my wife is German, and our kids attended German school through 8th grade) but have only ever lived in the US. As we realized our eldest would be graduating high school in 2020, if we wanted to undertake any adventure before they left for college, it would have to be now. With Tigera well established but still small enough to have its exec team based in San Francisco and focused on North America, pursuing this dream would mean moving into a very different role — and as I really enjoy the early stages of company building I decided this would be the time to make a move and jump right into the exciting Berlin tech startup scene.
And so, after a couple of trips to Berlin, we have found places at two excellent high schools there, and I am starting the next phase of my career with the amazing team at Kinvolk.
For those who don’t know Kinvolk, they are one of the most kick-ass engineering teams I know in the cloud native software space. They have deep Linux kernel expertise, but also understand the full application runtime stack including Kubernetes, container runtimes, networking, service mesh, visibility, operations, etc., and are world class security gurus to boot. They were the developers who worked with CoreOS on the rkt container runtime, the folks that extended Weave Scope with BPF support, and the security experts who discovered several security issues in Kubernetes and related projects. They have assisted some of the biggest names in the industry with hard-core systems engineering and penetration testing. And they are great community supporters, organizing meetups and conferences including All Systems Go! and Cloud Native Rejekts (debuting this weekend in Barcelona).
In short, if they’re not already, Kinvolk should be on your radar.
I’ll be joining the team with responsibility for business development, and also bringing additional leadership to the Berlin office while Chris Kuehl, the CEO, moves to Boulder, Colorado to establish a US subsidiary. We have some exciting plans, all built around the core principles of pushing the envelope with leading-edge Linux technologies, a uniquely strong focus on security, and embracing community and open source as the only viable way to achieve that objective.
You can see the first steps in this strategy with the announcement of Lokomotive, Kinvolk’s cutting-edge distribution of Kubernetes. Inspired by CoreOS Tectonic, Lokomotive serves both as a great product in its own right as well as a platform for the development of a suite of complementary tools building on the powerful capabilities in latest Linux kernels. And, talking of Linux, Kinvolk is one of the few Kubernetes companies to also maintain its own container-optimized operating system with Flatcar Linux, originally a fork of CoreOS Container Linux but now very much its own thing with a growing and enthusiastic user base.
Watch out for more updates from me and Kinvolk as I get up to speed, and we start to apply the incredible expertise and talent in the team to some of the hardest problems we see customers facing today as they adopt Kubernetes.
See you at KubeCon in Barcelona, and in Berlin after that!

This post was created by Avery V., one of LearnLux’s 2018 Campus Ambassadors. All experiences & opinions are her own.
When researching the “minimal expenses” one can expect for a study abroad experience… I was blown away.
Apartment $1,200/ monthGroceries ~ $100/ weekRestaurants ~ $30/weekTravel ~ $250–400 Miscellaneous ~ $200/month
Total Average Cost per month ~ $2100
I thought to myself, how the hell am I supposed to afford blowing through 2,100 dollars at the “minimum” per month?
I try to be as financially independent as I can, therefore I worked last summer as well as through the first semester of my Junior year to prepare for study abroad. However, even with the past cash-flows, there was no way I was going to be able to afford such an expensive per-month price tag!
For six months in Barcelona, I was supposed to have, at minimum, 12,600 dollars? There HAD to be another way…
I decided to do some research and figure out how to slim down this budget. Prior to arrival, I decided to break down my weekly and monthly expenses.
Let’s think…I have both fixed and variable expenses. Fixed= something that is of a consistent value that is pre-planned ahead of time. Think of an apartment expense, a gym membership, or a prescription cost. My fixed expenses were: my apartment and my gym membership.
Next I began thinking about my variable costs. Variable expenses= a cost that can change depending on the amount and frequency payment of a good or a service. Think of groceries, going out at night, or impromptu purchases. My variable costs were: groceries, restaurants, shopping, bulk buys (makeup or household supplies), entertainment activities (ex: going to movies), daily transportation (Taxis, Uber, local busses), and so many others.
While in Barcelona, I expect to have a complete new category: Travel. The exciting, pivotal, and expen$ive component of the studying abroad experience. Between flights, trains, transportation, food, activities, and special moments, I made sure to be realistic in my budgeting for travel plans.
Lost and confused, I turned to my dad who helped me see more clearly. As a Financial Advisor for the past 30 years, he sure gave me advice (some I liked and others less so). He basically reiterated the importance of frugality, especially as a college student without continuous income. He loved Calvin Coolidge’s quote:
“There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no independence quite so important, as living within your means.”
He then broke it down with an example featuring the smallest of purchases: Coffee.
“So Avery, let’s say you go to Starbucks or Dunkin three mornings a week to grab a coffee before class. Thats roughly $4/ day and $12/week. If you do this 52 weeks of the year… that is $624 on coffee alone! Now, lets extrapolate that to your 4 years of college. If you were to only have 3 morning coffee’s for your time in college, that is $ 2,496. And that is just coffee…”
Wow. He definitely has a point considering I get coffee 4 days a week and pay an extra .50 cents for almond milk!
This conversation sparked a whole new perspective. I do not need to get caught up in our culture heavily fixated on the consumption of unnecessary goods. I do not need to cut coffee out of my diet. Instead, I can buy $10 coffee grounds that will make over 70 cups of coffee. I began to apply this mentality to EVERYTHING.
Here are the changes I made, that ended up making a big difference:
1. I switched out American brands for (cheaper) Spanish equivalents2. I found the most affordable grocery store where I could buy in bulk3. I attend farmers markets for my fresh produce, instead of paying over 70% mark up at the close by stores.4. I limited eating out at restaurants and make more food at home (both cheaper and WAY more healthy)5. I ditched that $6 Starbucks order that only increases your spending, as well as your waist size… I see you with your grande double caramel macchiato with one pump mocha syrup, two pumps hazelnut, light ice, chocolate powder, add cinnamon dolce top, with light whipped cream… ya I’m talking to YOU6. I take the very efficient public transportation system in Barcelona. My monthly ticket costs 76 euros and has unlimited swipes. This compares to taking a 5–12 euro cab to each destination.7. I remembered to KEEP IN MIND THE CONVERSION RATE. Currently the dollar to euro rate is 1 dollar= .80 euro. This makes everything even more than the price tag states. Very important to remember.8. I travel with friends! This cuts down the cost of living and allows you the freedom to live in a nicer more central location.
These changes, although small, REALLY lowered my budget for each month. This task reminded me to stay intentional, think about needs vs. wants, plan ahead, and practice being responsible. Everyone can budget and still participate in everything while abroad. Just limit the unnecessary purchases so you can sip on your extra-special latte at the top of the Eiffel tower.

How FC Barcelona Caught La Liga Offside,https://julianb22.medium.com/fc-barcelona-2024-25-review-part-1-turning-offsides-into-a-weapon-7a52b7ef033e,"Sign up

This season, FC Barcelona’s bold defensive strategy has been central to their reclaiming of the La Liga title. At the core of this approach is a high defensive line, meticulously orchestrated to stifle opposition progression. The visualization below plots Offsides Conceded against Opposition Progressive Passing Distance, placing Barça in a distinct and extreme corner of the graph as they conceded by far the most offsides while simultaneously allowing the least progressive passing distance. This is not a coincidence but in fact the natural outcome of one of the most aggressive defensive setups in world football.
Anchored by the positioning and anticipation of Iñigo Martínez and Pau Cubarsí, Barcelona’s high line compresses the pitch, forcing opponents into their own half and encouraging them to attempt risky balls over the top. The result is a flurry of offside calls as attackers struggle to time their runs behind a relentlessly disciplined back line. By stepping up with precision, Barça not only denies space but also disrupts rhythm, collapsing the time and room opponents need to construct meaningful attacks. Progressive passing distance, a key indicator of territorial gain, is dramatically reduced under this pressure.
Naturally, this strategy carries inherent risks. A high defensive line demands elite timing and communication, particularly from central defenders and the goalkeeper. When the long-term injury to first-choice keeper and captain Marc-André ter Stegen threatened the integrity of the system, manager Hansi Flick remained committed to his tactical principles. Emergency signing Wojciech Szczęsny rose to the occasion, helping the team secure an extraordinary 43 points from a possible 45 in the league. Even so, goalkeeping with so much space behind the defence inevitably invites moments of uncertainty, most memorably against Benfica, when Szczęsny collided with Alejandro Balde while charging out to intercept a ball played over the top.
When executed with the precision Barcelona have shown under Flick, the high line becomes a proactive defensive weapon. The high number of offsides conceded is not a sign of disorganisation, but a deliberate, repeatable outcome of a system designed to neutralise threats before they emerge. It is controlled through compression, and over the course of the season, it proved to be remarkably effective.

I realized a long time ago that our lives are like football teams. Everyone needs a good team to have a chance at success.
Ultimately, what brings success is diligence and tactics — a balanced and a realistic plan. Tonight, Barca had everything: a good team, diligence but fell short due to their half baked plan.
Nathaniel Bassey is simply saying;
""know when to go all out and when to be reserved"".
If your plan lacks balance and realism, it is half baked. What Barca did in the last minutes of normal time lacked reality.
In a football team, everyone needs to be diligent at their respective duties to have a shot at success. It is the duty of attackers to create and convert chances while the defenders tighten security and stop attacks.
This applies to reality as well. Your team — which can also be your circle of friends or social circle, needs people who can bring and take opportunities, as well as people who can protect from being extorted. You need someone who understands the game enough to devise plans that drive you forward, as well as people who share the same interest as yours to be dedicated to your course.
Every team needs a good manager (the tactician), an X factor in attack and defense, and the will to succeed:
Be cautious of the team you buildBe cautious of the relationships you keepBe cautious of the circle you keepBe cautious of your aspirations.

In a crowded café on Barcelona’s Plaza Molina, they chant his name, exuberant at the flash of magic. Waiters pound their metal trays on the counter, college students throw their arms in the air, and old men shake their heads in disbelief. Together they shout his name with abandon, over and over again. Messi! Messi! Messi! He’s done it again. On this night, the shining light of Barcelona football has created a moment of legend, the type of play that turns mortal players into a name that is chanted into the night.
I found this café by accident, wandering down the hillside from my flat in Putxet. Plaza Molina, a busy Metro stop, was not my destination. Typically, I strolled past the bustling square on my way into Gràcia, skipping the little restaurants on the border of the plaza filled with commuters and business people stopping for drinks on the way home.
But the lights of a small place on the corner caught my eye. My only goal was to find a place to watch the Barca match and have a beer. The café was small, but I spotted an empty stool at the cramped counter. Drowned by the sound of the announcers booming from the TV, I…

The day felt special for many reasons. Firstly, it was the first spring day warm enough to wear shorts outside. Coincidentally, this day happened to be the 23rd of April in Catalunya — otherwise known as Sant Jordi. The streets were filled with book stalls and flower stands, overwhelming the carrers of Barcelona with the smell of paper and roses.
Catalan flags were wrapped around every book stall, hung from balconies, and wrapped in ribbons around the singular roses that would soon be gifted to loved ones. Sant Jordi feels less like a festival for books — it’s a declaration of cultural Catalan pride.
A long time ago, there was a fearsome dragon that wreaked havoc on the inhabitants of a small village in Catalunya called Montblanc. In order to keep the dragon from destroying the village, the townspeople decided they would sacrifice one person every day through a lottery system.

By Vasco ValentimCreative at VBAT
For sixteen years now, OFFF takes place in Barcelona at the Museu de Disseny. It’s a platform where a vast variety of creatives share knowledge and experiences across all disciplines of Design. It’s where we go to drink and soak our creative souls.
Nowadays, OFFF is a creative hub and platform based in Barcelona with extensions all over the globe: Mexico City, Porto, Milan, New York City, you name it.
This year’s edition had an incredible line-up. From the holy Lance Wyman to legendary Vaughan Oliver, Imaginary Forces, Buck, or Vallée Duhamel, Annie Atkins, Stink Studios, Gary Baseman, Moving Brands, Anthony Burrill, Joshua Davis, and many many more.
The vibe and outside mood made it feel almost like a music summer festival.
Thursday I made sure to attend to Buck , a house of motion-graphics to be reckoned with. Here, the main venue had its biggest crowd of the day and it was completely justified. These guys are really solid and an inspiration. Just check the video below and you will know what I mean. Fascinating to learn how this short was created and realize that everything really starts with pen and paper.
Afterwards, it was Vaughan Oliver’s turn. I was looking forward to this one. Oliver was a delight to listen to — to learn how he created, back in the 80’s, together with the 4AD label, some of the incredible album covers for The Cocteau Twins, Breeders, Lush or Pixies. Looking back, as he said, he ended up doing what he loved most — designing covers of music albums, specially during that exciting post-punk period. His work is very recognizable — bold, vigorous, and ironic at times. Photography played a huge part in his work. He collaborated intensively with Chris Bigg throughout his golden days at 4AD, juxtaposing powerful imagery with puzzling blackmail lettering. Pure graphic design.
The crowd now was not as enthusiastic nor as full as with Buck; you could see that the young scene is not really familiar with Oliver, and I couldn’t help feeling bad for him. A great opportunity wasted out the window! Generation gap, I suppose.
The first day was coming to an end, and Imaginary Forces were the last speakers. These are the guys behind the hyped Stranger Things TV show main titles, Mad Men, Jessica Jones, Band of Brothers, Boardwalk Empire or Vinyl. Karen Fong and Michelle Dougherty were the speakers in charge.
Again it was interesting to see that even with the most mainstream media, everything starts with a piece of paper and a pencil.
It’s a very hands-on process, very intuitive and empiric some-how. For the Jessica Jones main titles sequence, for instance, they wanted to be true to the original covers of the comic books Jessica Jones: Alias, by David Mack, in which he uses watercolors profusely, something that became very iconic and popular among the fans. So, they started exploring ways of filming and portraying ink mixing with water, on glass or other media. The idea was to blend it eventually with actual footage.
Friday, was the day of Annie Atkins and Moving Brands.
“My name is Annie and I do graphic design for movies”.
That’s how Atkins introduced herself to the crowd. Annie is from Dublin and studied at Film School, only to realize that what she’s really passionate about is, actually, graphic design. Her first job was doing the graphic design for the 2007 Showtime The Tudors. She was working with the graphic design department on the show, and would create everything that you can think of: from patterns for tapestries, to medieval calligraphy on a wide variety of documents of the kingdom of Henry VIII.
The project was successful would lead to new opportunities and eventually she managed to work with directors like Steven Spielberg (on A Bridge of Spies) or Wes Anderson, on The Grand Budapest Hotel. Here her role as a graphic designer got to its higher, since she and her peers had to design virtually everything to the fictional Empire of Zubrowka. Documents, stamps, passports, telegrams, newspapers (!), maps, or other items, like packaging for pastries or even book covers. It was interesting to learn the difference between hero props and regular props, background props; some of these props are of course always in the background, out of sight, out of focus even, whilst when you have a hero prop, like the Mendl’s pastries box in The Grand Budapest Hotel, eventually you may get to have your piece shine in the silver screen for 2–3 seconds, in all it’s majestic glory.
In film, every item is unique and has to be replicated at least a dozen of times, so that, for instance, an actor can open an envelope (prop) on any given take and that this envelope is new and look the same, with its stamp and handwriting looking the same from a scene that possible did appear before in the film. Atkins loves her craft. She truly does.
Moving Brands turn was up next, with co-founder Jim Bull. Well known among us creatives, Moving Brands has offices across the globe. Originally from the North of England, Bull gave a non-apologetic talk, direct, honest and inspiring. Their work speak for themselves, so Jim was more interested in sharing mind-sets: sheepism, as he called it, is a terrible but avoidable tendency that ought to be stopped. We, as creatives that are responsible, must avoid sheepism at all costs, to follow hollow trends that lead to empty and fake brands that look like carbon copies of each others. Brands that in the end lack added value or recognition at all.
Saturday was the last day and I tried to make the most out of it. American illustrator and painter Gary Baseman, was interesting, unexpected, wild and crazy.
Anthony Burrill, gave a talked focused on typography and letterpress. Burrill shared is love for bold shapes, urban signs and symbols. To be passionate and honest about yourself and your work. He is the creator of the poster Work Hard & Be Nice to People, all set and printed manually, on a letterpress machine.
And lastly, Lance Wyman. Graduated from Pratt Institute in NYC, Wyman is regarded as one of the greatest, just like Paul Rand or Otl Aicher.
It’s incredible to think that Wyman was only 29 years old when he won the pitch for the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games. A time that brought him success, recognition and effectively launched his now long and vast career.
As he shared with us, at the time, he and his partner didn’t have enough money to get return tickets from Mexico, so they ended up staying there for a few years, leading up consequently to work on the Mexico City Metro visual identity as well, something that Wyman is very proud of, especially how such a complex premise could be simplified and systematized virtually using only a set of bold icons and colors — something still new at the time.
Wyman has transformed cities and public spaces across the world through the simple power of iconography. It is a reminder that often good design is timeless, pure, simple — and above all transversal and understandable to all cultures.
All in all, OFFF Barcelona is an experience you should not miss, refreshing and inspirational.

The non remote events are back, which is great!
I had the opportunity to attend for the first one (for me) after the pandemic and I did a little summary to share my thoughts about it.
I am Borja Pernía, a Venezuelan software developer who has lived in Barcelona since 2012. I have been working at ManoMano since January 2020 and I like to assist to different events related to software development.
For personal reasons, I only could assist the first day during the morning and this is the summary of the talks that I assisted.
They talked about the necessity to use OpenTelemetry
Important concepts in observability
First steps into the Voxel implementation
What is OpenTelemetry?
Demo time!
Questions & Answers
Quick overview of data disciplines
The infrastructure for handle data in Hotjar
About data qualityImportant: accuracy, consistency, completeness, timeliness, validity, uniqueness
Lessons learned
As a summary, the talks that I assisted had interesting topics that could help us to improve our day-to-day work in several levels (to know several ways to have a better functional programming experience, to understand how to monitorize our applications in a correct and simpler way or starting to build a BI infrastructure based on the experience of somebody that already lived it).
I enjoyed coming back to a face-to-face event with a great set of speakers, , and a good mood among the crowd. I hope to attend next year’s edition too :)
If you want to continue the conversation about this or other events, contact or chat with me on LinkedIn.
As usual in this kind of events, the opening was a moment to present the team involved and thanked to the sponsors (ManoMano included! \o/ ). Something that was new for me: the post-covid protocol during the event (use of masks, leave the rooms at the end of the talks, etc.) and the presentation of two organizations (BCN women who code and Codebar).

An Indonesian in Barcelona, sharing my journey in marketing & design. Expect personal stories, professional tips, and a bit of everything in between.

It was Christmas time in Barcelona, and I was facing a creature I’d never encountered before: a log with a painted-on smiley face, wearing a Santa hat. This wasn’t Rudolph or Frosty; this was “Tio de Nadal,” and apparently, I was supposed to beat it with a stick. Welcome to Catalonia, right?
That’s how my adventure in Barcelona began — a whirlwind of cultural quirks, language barriers, and unexpected discoveries. My journey started when I followed my husband to his hometown, leaving behind my familiar life in Indonesia. I was a graphic designer by profession, but little did I know that this move would lead me down a new career path and spark a whole new set of passions.
My career started in the vibrant world of children’s publishing, where I worked as an art designer for a foreign magazine with a local editorial team in Indonesia. It was a fun and creative environment, but I soon felt the pull to explore new horizons. That led me to a graphic design and marketing promotion role for a real estate and hospitality company in a different city. This was my first taste of the marketing world, and I quickly realized I had a knack for it.
A few years later, I landed a position as a creative designer and digital marketer for a factory. This was where my fascination with the digital world truly blossomed. I was immersed in website design, social media campaigns, and the ever-evolving landscape of online marketing. And then came AI — the game-changer that sparked a whole new level of curiosity in me. I was hooked!
You can read more about my experiences in Barcelona and my journey as a digital marketer in my Medium article: https://medium.com/didavirda/the-future-of-digital-marketing-a-2025-vision-504ff52485aa.
Learning a new language is like navigating a maze blindfolded. You bump into walls, take wrong turns, and occasionally stumble upon a hidden gem. That’s been my experience with Spanish and Catalan.
Despite my best efforts (and countless hours with Duolingo), my progress has been…let’s just say “gradual.” But I’ve learned to embrace the stumbles, the mispronounced words, and the occasional blank stares. It’s all part of the adventure.
The truth is, my attempts to speak Spanish often end up as a jumbled mix of Spanish, English, and even some Catalan thrown in for good measure. “Spanglish” with a Catalan twist, anyone? But hey, I’m learning, and that’s what matters.
Amidst the linguistic chaos, I found solace in a surprising place: Sashiko and embroidery. These intricate crafts, with their repetitive stitches and calming rhythms, became my refuge. They provided a sense of accomplishment and a way to connect with a new culture through its traditional art forms.
As an introvert, moving to a new city always presents a unique set of challenges. But trading the familiar hustle and bustle of Jakarta and Surabaya for the vibrant energy of Barcelona brought a new dimension to my introverted experience. While both Indonesia and Spain have their own brand of urban energy, the cultural shift and the unfamiliarity of my surroundings amplified my need for solitude. I found myself retreating into the comfort of our house, venturing out mostly for errands or when accompanied by my husband.
But here’s the thing: I didn’t feel lonely.
In fact, I discovered a newfound sense of fulfillment in my solitude. I filled my days with new hobbies, exploring the city at my own pace, and diving deeper into the digital world that fascinated me. I learned to embrace my introversion, finding joy in the quiet moments and the freedom to explore my own interests.
My journey in Barcelona has been a tapestry of unexpected turns, new passions, and personal growth. From accidental digital marketer to “Spanglish”-speaking crafter, I’ve embraced the challenges and discovered new facets of myself along the way. And while my introverted nature might keep me close to home most days, I’ve found a rhythm that works for me, a balance between solitude and connection, exploration and comfort.
I’m constantly learning and adapting, embracing the changes and challenges that come with living in a new country. And I’ve come to realize that the most rewarding part of this journey is not just the destination, but the process itself.
Looking back on my journey, I’ve learned a few valuable lessons:
I hope my story inspires you to embrace change, embrace your individuality, and pursue your passions, no matter where you find yourself in the world.

I like to participate in boutique-like forest trail ultras where there are only a handful of runners but last month I somehow managed to run the Zurich Barcelona Marathon with 16000+ runners signed up.
I usually don't care about my finishing time as any finished ultra is a success for me regardless of time. But now I ran a marathon distance with many other runners and this made me think about the end result.
I found this presentation of my result clean and simple but incredibly boring.
My finishing time was 3:31:44. I'm relatively happy with that time but I know that I got tired in the end. How did that compare to the people around me? How fast are the pro runners compared to me?
I decided to take all the results I could find and write a small program that would give me a more visual overview of the event.
First thoughts:
I also took a look into the finishing times and it seems that people who aimed under 3h and under 4h were pretty successful (no peak after the time in a graph) but it seems that a lot of runners with aim of 2h45min, 3h30min and 4h15min barely missed their mark.
The slower you are, the more you slow down in the second half of the race. People around the 4h finishing time were avg 10% slower in the 2nd half, that means a whopping 24min added.
And the race starts from the 25th km :) Almost everybody is able to hold the pace till 25th km but every next kilometre is getting harder to keep the pace.
Regardless of your results, it's amazing to see so many people running! We are all winners!

Hop on the time machine for a moment. We are going back to 2011. FC Barcelona was arguably the best club in the world. Nobody can forget their attacking, quick-passing, total football display versus a stacked Manchester United side managed by Sir Alex Ferguson under the lights of the great Wembley Stadium in the Champions League final. The match ended 3–1 with a goal apiece from Barcelona’s starting front 3 as they were crowned champions of Europe. Experts and pundits predicted a decade of dominance from the Blaugranas with Pep Guardiola at the helm and exciting youngsters from La Masia under his wing.
Fast-forward to 2021, FC Barcelona are in a financial mess, of around 1 billion Euros, unable to register their greatest player ever and their new signings due to the extreme wage budget. Things on the pitch haven’t been great either, with humiliations vs Roma, Liverpool, Bayern and PSG in the last 4 years being the main talking points. They do have, what many fans believe to be, the perfect leader in Joan Laporta. He has to clean this financial mess and needs to make proper signings to bring the club to where it used to be. He has made a few in Aguero, Depay, Emerson and Eric Garcia. Eric Garcia seems to be the replacement for the ageing Pique. There are other options in that position in Oscar Mingueza and the very promising, Ronald Araujo.
But the glaring void is seen in the left centre-back position. Clement Lenglet has never been the same since the Bayern debacle, with his numerous mistakes leading to costly points dropped in the league and Samuel Umtiti is not even a shadow of himself after constant injuries and pretty much zero game time. I personally think that the club needs a new signing at the left CB position and must look for one in this summer itself, if possible. So, in this article, we see some of the available and affordable options in that position and hopefully, finalize one player to help Barcelona fill the void.
All the data used in this article is from the brilliant fbref.com and the videos used for eye-test is from fullmatchsports.com.
REQUIREMENTS FOR A FC BARCELONA CENTRE-BACK
1. The current manager, Ronald Koeman started out with a 4–2–3–1 upon his arrival and moved to a 3–5–2/3–1–4–2 as he gathered that his CBs were being exposed in a 4-at-the-back system with their lack of pace. His decision to switch to a back three has produced good results and Barcelona has gained a bit of stability since. So, our centre-back should be able to slot in the left of a three-at-the-back system and as the left CB in a 4-ATB, if Koeman plans to revert back to one.
2. The centre-back should have excellent ball distribution. He should be able to play the ball out from the back with minimal errors. He must be able to distribute passes from the back to the LB(Mostly Jordi Alba) and line-breaking passes to the midfielders. He should also be able to carry the ball forward with confidence and find one of the teammates when there is space ahead.
3. He should be very good under pressure and be able to get himself out of it using quick thinking and good decision-making.
4. Jordi Alba is often closer to the attackers than the defenders. So, our new CB must take the responsibility of providing cover in the left flank. Even if he lacks pace, he must be very aware positionally and thus help the team to regain possession quickly by winning the ball when the opponent decides to break and counter.
5. He must be good aerially and make sensible decisions when opponents take the long-ball approach.
6. In a 3 ATB, he will play with Eric Garcia and Ronald Araujo mostly. Garcia is a very ‘Pique’ type defender, not too quick but relies heavily on his positional awareness and a decent on-the-ball defender. Araujo is strong, aerially dominant, faster than the average centre-back but doesn’t possess the best ball playing qualities. Our CB must compliment both the CBs by providing cover for Garcia’s lack of pace and Araujo’s lack of technicality.
7. Brownie points if he has already played in a team which plays possession-based attacking football.
THE FIRST DRAFT
Our first draft of players includes left-footed CBs in top clubs from Europe’s top 5 leagues. The selected CBs play in clubs only from which Barcelona can buy, so players from direct domestic rivals and Euroepan rivals are excluded. The 5 CBs from our first draft in no particular order are :
We will now use the fbref data available to get an idea of what each player offers to their respective teams and what they can offer for FC Barcelona. All the data is from the 2020/21 league season and is adjusted to per 90 minutes. The five-man draft will be deduced to a final shortlist of three for eye-test.
DATA ANALYSIS
Defensive Contribution : In this plot, we measure the defensive capabilities of the CBs using their Tackles+Interceptions numbers and Successful pressures that helped their team win the ball back. From the possession-adjusted data, we can clearly see how Bastoni leads his peers in both metrics. Botman is not far either. Pau Torres fails to impress here.
Discipline : Unsuccessful tackles or pressures might lead to fouls and bookings and this plot gives an idea of how clean/dirty the CBs are. Botman is the cleanest of them all, even though he had higher tackling and pressure numbers. Laporte obviously has higher numbers considering him playing in a team that dominates possession almost every game.
Passing : A very important attribute for a FC Barcelona centreback. Laporte excels in both progressive and final third passes while Botman, Pau and Bastoni have good numbers too. Romagnoli doesn’t make a case for him here.
Carries : While Bastoni leads in final third carries, Laporte once again exhibits his brilliant on-ball ability by completing around 10 progressive carries p90. Romagnoli does not possess the same on-ball characteristics as the others.
Aerial Prowess : Something that is a must for a Barca CB is good aerial ability. Teams tend to exploit the high defensive line of Barcelona and the CBs have to be aware of balls over the top to the forward or in the wings. Laporte once again leads the pack with Romagnoli second and Botman a close third.
From the above metrics, there are three standouts.
Alessandro BastoniAymeric LaporteSven Botman
With eye-test by watching previous matches, the strengths and weaknesses in each of the three players’ game are noted. There are few other factors in each player which are also taken into consideration. They will be explained below. Now, let us take a look at each player.
ALESSANDRO BASTONI
Pros : Bastoni is widely regarded as the future of Italian defence. At such a young age of 22, Bastoni has already established him as an undisputed starter at Inter. He has already played in a 3 ATB under his club manager Antonio Conte. Bastoni is skilled in switching the play to the right wingback with quick and accurate switch passes. He also often finds Lukaku by threading a ball over the top in/around the left half space behind the defensive line. This can be mirrored here, by using Fati/Depay as the receiver. This could benefit Barcelona when they are trying to find a way through low-block teams. He is also a very confident ball carrier and has the ability to find a progressive/key pass following that carry. He is quick enough to recover when he loses possession.
Cons : Bastoni doesn’t have any obvious weaknesses in his personal game. There are some other factors, though. His defensive partners at Inter have been two experienced CBs in Milan Skriniar and Stefan De Vrij. While Barca needs some experience to settle their defence for their pursuit of the league and the Champions League, signing Bastoni means he becomes one of the many young defenders Barca have. It is also a huge gamble to bring him from Serie A to La Liga for such a huge price (60M Euros according to transfermarkt.com, might even be more), which makes him the most expensive defender in La Liga history. A question remains on would he justify the price tag. Barca cannot afford another failed transfer, if Bastoni does fail.
Verdict : Bastoni is an excellent defender and a fantastic investment for the future. He possesses all qualities to become a Barcelona defender but in the current financial situation, he is an expensive, ambitious and risky option who Barca might have to stay away from, for now.
AYMERIC LAPORTE
Pros : Laporte has lost his place to Ruben Dias in the city defence. He is such a quality defender to not be playing regularly. Laporte had a brilliant Euro 2020 partnered with either Garcia or Pau Torres. He has the knack of finding line-breaking passes and is a supreme carrier of the ball, one of the best in the business. He has brilliant positional awareness and commits minimal errors while playing out from the back. He has played in a 3 ATB in City in a few instances. He also plays under Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique who share the similar philosophy as Barca. He is cheaper(45M Euros according to transfermarkt.com) and has better experience in big stages. There are various news outlets suggesting that he wants out because of his lack of game time.
Cons : Laporte’s only weakness might be his lack of pace. Also, Manchester City might not sell another CB as that would leave them with only three natural centre-backs(Dias, Stones, Ake). They might demand huge money. Barca may have to sell two or more players to meet City’s asking price.
Verdict : Laporte is a low-risk high quality CB, who fits in Barca’s defence like a glove but there are a few complications financially, which should be solved for this transfer to go through.
SVEN BOTMAN
Pros : Fresh from winning Ligue 1 with Lille, Botman is one of the most sort out CBs at the moment. He is 195 cm tall, strong and physically imposing which is very similar to Ronald Araujo. But, he differs from Araujo in the fact that he has brilliant on-the-ball quality. He often finds the LW/LB with a through ball behind the lines that puts them in space to run into. He is also brilliant in 1v1 situations and makes calculated tackles. Due to his height and huge physique, he can be a much needed set-piece threat. He is the least expensive of the three options(28M Euros according to transfermarkt.com).
Cons : Just 21 years old, Barcelona cannot expect any kind of experience from the dutchman. He is not a natural ball carrier like Laporte and is not upto the mark in his aerial distribution. He also struggles a bit when put under pressure and makes some hasty decisions. He has often played in a 4 ATB system, but has never been tested in a 3 ATB system.
Verdict : Though less expensive, Botman has had only one season in the Ligue 1 and it would be a huge gamble if Barcelona decide to keep faith on him, which I think is not the best thing to do.
CONCLUSION
Laporte definitely edges both of them with his experience. Even though his price is a problem, his recent success in the Euros and him sharing the same dressing room with Alba, Busquets, Pedri and Garcia means he would be the most fitting of all the options. 45M is a monstrous price in these circumstances but he has already proven his quality in the PL after arriving at Manchester City with a similar price tag. FC Barcelona receives a centre-back who fits their playstyle and more importantly, brings much needed experience and quality. Come on Mr. Laporta, import Laporte to the Nou Camp !
Thank you for spending your time in reading this article. I hope you enjoyed it.

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

I was in Barcelona for an event last week. Also, it’s the first time in Barcelona for me. I know that the city is one of the best as the “city design” in the world. But I saw it with a different eye. Can it be also the best city as we think in user experience?
First of all, I loved the city. In Europe, there is just Portugal I haven’t visited yet and the only city/country that I want to live in is Rotterdam. It is a “lively” city that has lots of foreigners and everyone knows English (so I don’t need to learn Dutch that I already learned!). Also, there are lots of “expats” so you feel comfortable as a foreign. And, of course, Berlin is the city that I want to go to again and again :). After all, Barcelona is the second city I want to go to again and maybe to live there!
I loved the city not because everyone knew English and I felt comfortable about everything (to be honest, just a few people know English, we had such hard times to communicate). I loved the city because both the city and the people make you feel comfortable about living in the environment.
As I said, I saw just a few people who know English very well, and again just a few who know English “a little” to communicate. But after all, even if they didn’t understand what I was asking, they got the “situation” and tried to help me. In Turkey, we sometimes have fun with these “a little English” people who try to explain the route you’ve asked with “Go go go, left, go go, right, go, there”. And I also saw them in Barcelona! After all, I handle everything with them. So, even if you don't know English, you can communicate with them, just show what you want.
Like they don’t speak that much English, they also don’t use English signs. That is also because they use Catalan as their first language and Spanish is the second, so mostly there is no space for an English word. But you can use the city without a foreign language because of their signs! In the metro, you mostly can’t see an English word but with their sign language, you can go wherever you want. For example in Turkey, at the stations we both use Turkish and English announcements and signs. But if you also don’t know English, you will have a hard time. But in Barcelona, they use the line numbers, the line flow, and some good signs to show where to go and where to wait.
I also see those signs at the airport. For example, if you need to do something about tax-free, you need to go to Terminal 1. But our flight was from Terminal 2 and we just looked at that sign and realized we needed to go that way to find our “shuttle”. Also, they put the same sign at the door that we need to go through.
I need to mention another thing if we are talking about the city's accessibility. I saw so many people with wheelchairs and with a walking stick because they couldn’t see. Those people were all alone, there was no one to help them with the lights, sidewalk, or getting in a store. They can do all of these by themselves.
I try to create websites that everyone can “access”, everyone can use it smoothly and feel comfortable as they do these. From now on, I want to make websites like Barcelona! And hope to see it again :).

Collection of reflections and experiences aimed at reimagining our society from an economic, social and environmental point of view

I have been to Barcelona several times, but since the last time it had been 10 years now.
A period in which the city experienced great transformations, socially and aesthetically speaking, related to urban regeneration. Fruit of the work of one mayor in particular, Ada Colau, a “grassroots” activist who brought a breath of new air to the city, and of many other figures who believed in positive change for local communities.
For work reasons, I was in Barcelona for a couple of days, and I took the opportunity for a “regeneration tour” in 24 hours, to understand what has changed in the city and what has unfortunately or fortunately remained the same over time.
I walk out of the hotel in Poblenou where I was staying and already I feel happy. In front of me trees and bushes hide the concrete. No horns or engine noise nearby, just the sound of Barcelona’s typical green parrots. The impact that noise pollution has on us becomes much clearer in these moments, yet we struggle to notice it in our daily lives. I keep walking, imagining what the city would be like if it were full of spaces like this, and what all cities would be like if the gray palette of urbanism…

Earlier this month, one of the main football agreements in recent decades was made official. Leading brands in their fields of activity, Barcelona and Spotify closed a medium/long-term partnership, which promises to take the relationship between sport and entertainment to another level.To understand this business in greater depth, we first need to understand what led each of us to get here.
Spotify is a music streaming company, founded in 2006 in Sweden. At the time, people basically had two options for listening to their favorite songs digitally: paying for each one (iTunes model), or pirating with platforms like Napster.
The company, which was only officially launched two years later, emerged as a viable option between these two options, with a business model based on offering a “freemium” service (see below), and thus gained a very popular user base. large, obviously much more because of the “free” part than the “premium” part.
In the same year of release (2008) Spotify sold around 19% of its stakes to major record labels (Sony, Universal, Warner and EMI) as licensing agreements for their music. Ten years later, it went public on the New York Stock Exchange, valued at US$ 26.5 billion, and months later saw the record companies sell their shares, with the exception of Sony, which still kept half of it, and Universal, which still holds the same stake (today both have, together, something around 6% to 7% of the Swedish company). Read more about Spotify’s ownership structure here.
At the end of the same year, it launched its services in countries in the Middle East and North Africa and in 2019, two important news came: for the first time, the company was profitable, and it announced a change in strategy and positioning.
From then on, it would become a company focused on audio, rather than just music. From there, we saw a series of actions by Spotify in an attempt to expand its operations via the podcast market, buying from two start-ups in the sector, Gimlet Media and Anchor.
In 2020, it acquired exclusivity via licensing agreement for the most famous podcast on the platform, the controversial The Joe Rogan Experience (video below), for US$ 100 million (which was later reported to have been for double the value), in addition to signing partnerships with influencer Kim Kardashian, and with DC Comics. Investment in the audio sector lasts until today, and even expands into the audiobook business.
This diversification/expansion of operations makes even more sense when we understand a little more about the margin that each “product” offers Spotify.
A part of the business model, mentioned briefly at the beginning of the text, is based on a complex formula for paying royalties to record companies and artists (Read more here). Many of the singers complain that they are paid much less than they should (Spotify has gained great bargaining power), and they show great dissatisfaction. The singer Taylor Swift even removed her songs from the platform in 2014 as a form of protest.
It is stipulated, however, that 70% of the earnings that the company has with its music, is passed on to the record companies, which in turn, are responsible for paying the artists (Spotify recently even created an institutional website, Loud & Clear , with very interesting information on revenue generation and transfer of these). When someone listens to a podcast like Joe Rogan’s, the company appropriates all the money.
Today the company is the leader in its field, with 31% of the market share of the global music streaming market (graph below), according to MIDiA Research, a company that conducts research and analysis of digital markets in its survey for the second quarter. of 2021.
Despite being consolidated at the top, Spotify saw its share percentage drop compared to the same period in recent years: 33% in 2020 and 34% in 2019. At the same time, it is beginning to see the growth of Amazon Music, a service offered within from Amazon’s Video Bundle, and from YouTube Music. The study points out that the latter:
“It particularly resonates with Gen Z and younger Millennials, which should set alarm bells ringing for Spotify as its core subscriber base of 2010s Millennials in the West is starting to age.”
In 2021, Spotify implemented a price increase for several plans worldwide, including in Brazil, which may indicate, once again, an attempt to increase its margins, even with the number of users growing every quarter. Currently, according to the last report published, Spotify has 406 million active monthly users (between free and premium accounts), with a forecast that would reach 418 million in the first quarter of this year.
Within this context, Spotify started approaching football a few years ago, starting with partnerships with clubs that now have official profiles on the platform, and making playlists created by their players available. This was the case with clubs in Brazil, such as Palmeiras, the first in the country to have a profile on the platform, São Paulo and Santos. Boca Juniors also closed with the company (video below) in 2019. All these agreements, inclusive, were between 2016 and 2019.
On the other hand, in recent years Barcelona has been in a delicate economic situation. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers got so much worse, to the point that the former CEO, Ferran Reverter, declared that if the club had been a limited company, it could have gone bankrupt in early 2021.In addition to having lower revenues (mainly related to its Stadium, photo below), Barcelona broke the record of spending in its history: €1.13 billion. €112 were invested in the development of Espai Barça (project to modernize and renovate the Camp Nou and its surroundings), in addition to other “extraordinary expenses”.
As a consequence, the Catalan club released its accounts for the 2020/21 season with a deficit of €481 million. Projected revenue for the current season, meanwhile, was approved at 765 million, up 21.2% from past earnings.
Within these contexts, Barcelona and Spotify seem to have found in each other possibilities to solve their (current and future) problems. Spotify will be Barcelona’s sponsor and the club’s official Audio Streaming partner. The agreement, valid from July this year, basically involves four fronts:
The first point refers to the sponsorship of the game uniforms of the men’s and women’s professional football teams (until 2025/26), which, according to the Mundo Deportivo portal, will be €57.5 million (R$292.5 million). Which will keep Barcelona as the third club that earns with sponsorship in their kit (graphic below). Spotify will also print the training shirts of the two teams, and of the Catalan football schools, the Barça Academy Pro, until 2024/25, for another €5 million (R$ 25.4 million).
Now, Spotify takes over as the club’s sole football sponsor, replacing three other companies. Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce company, paid something around €55m to €60m (this last season, the amounts dropped to between €30m and €35m due to the effects of the pandemic) to stamp the center of the shirt. of the men’s team.
Beko, the home appliance company, paid €19m to appear on the sleeves of the game’s uniform and training shirt. With the pandemic, Beko renegotiated the contract to reduce the payment to between €12 and €10 million, giving up space in the sleeves.
Stanley Black & Decker, an industrial and domestic tools company, has been the official shirt sponsor of the women’s team since 2018, and paid €3 million per season.
The agreement also involves the sponsorship of naming rights for the stadium, which will be divided into two stages: 1) while the modernization of Espai Barça lasts and 2) another long-term agreement after the completion of the renovation of Camp Nou, which will be renamed Spotify. Camp Nou (pictured below) from the middle of this year. The Swedish company will also have its brand present in other locations in the stadium.
Also according to Mundo Deportivo, this will be a €5 million deal for the first six seasons, with the possibility of renewal for another 15 years for between €15m and €20m for each of them.
The approval of the Espai Barça project took place at the end of last year, coincidence or not, two years after the Santiago Bernabéu modernization project. The works should be completed by the end of 2027, but the Camp Nou stadium is expected to be completed two years earlier, as shown in an official statement from the club. The expected expenditure is €1.5 billion.
Hoping that the alliance with Spotify will make the project “transform the facilities and surroundings of the stadium into a new world-class entertainment experience open to the city of Barcelona”, Barcelona intends to fund it with events that do not involve football matches (see chart below). In a dossier (very detailed, by the way) released by Barça, 63% of projected revenues will come from hospitality, sponsorship and naming rights, and from meetings and events.
The third part of the agreement involves advertising assets at Spotify Camp Nou and Estadio Johan Cruyff (where the women’s and men’s football teams play), on billboards, press room, mixed zone, among others.
Finally, the partnership also includes experiences and the presence of audiovisual content, hospitality packages (remember the graphic above?) and “Barça experiences”.
A deal of this magnitude represents a step forward for sportainment. This business is the biggest one involving sports and music (although we have other important ones, as shown in Jay-Z’s relationship with football). With this panorama, we can analyze even more possible advantages for each one of those involved.
Regarding branding, the first aspect that is evident is the reinforcement of the global character that the brands achieved in this co-branding, as evidenced in the official announcement:
“The collaboration with Spotify also marks the Club’s strategic objective to proactively seek partners who share the values and philosophy that define its brand and, at the same time, allow it to maintain its status as a global reference, within and off the field, in an increasingly competitive environment”
While Barcelona on its main social networks has more than 260 million followers (only on official accounts in Spanish), Spotify, as shown above, has more than 400 million active users and has been expanding its operations.
Remember the Midia Research study, which said that Spotify’s main user base in the West was “starting to age”? So let’s go to the last part of the company’s announcement:
“Barcelona have legions of young fans all over the world — in fact, the majority of Barça fans are under 30, which is an extremely important audience for Spotify. These fans also reside in some of Spotify’s fastest growing markets, including India, Latin America and Indonesia.”
Still in these numbers, what may have been the main factor of this agreement is data sharing. Both can use each other’s database to get to know the consumption habits of fans/users and improve their products and also seek cross-selling. This can happen, for example, through geo-location, as exemplified by Spotify itself:
“Spotify is working with Barça to leverage our access to elements within the stadium to promote artists and enable discovery. For example, using dynamic digital displays to showcase and geographically target artists relevant to Barça’s global TV audience. While viewers in Europe might see a message about an artist, viewers in India might get a different and locally relevant message.”
In terms of management, both would now also become an entertainment hub. Spotify has the possibility of no longer being restricted to the digital realm, but now, it can “tangibilize” its experiences in one of the main tourist cities in Europe by having the physical space of Camp Nou and its surroundings at your disposal. It is possible that we will see the Swedish company promoting launches, events or even producing shows themselves.
It is conceivable that Spotify follows the line of “original productions”, as Netflix and Amazon do, and becomes the owner (as in the case of Joe Rogan’s podcast) and content producer, which would increase its profit margin and would also be a differential in relation to its competitors.
Barcelona also benefits from this, because it will likely have secondary financial gains by taking a share in the revenues of possible future concerts organized in their stadium. Furthermore, the use of Camp Nou (pictured below) would not only be limited during the game season, but throughout the entire year, which would generate recurring revenue for a longer period of time.
This, without counting, of course, the immediate financial gain that the culés will have. Adding all the amounts together, the first years of the agreement will give the club around €67.5 million (playing and training uniform and naming rights), which represents 10.7% of its revenues from last season.
Complex and multi-factorial, the partnership between Barcelona and Spotify is very promising and, as seen here, very, very coherent.

As I explored in my assessment of Barcelona’s recent victory over Sevilla, there are signs that Xavi Hernández is doing more than just getting good results. He’s moulding a very accomplished footballing system.
But recently, not everything has been rosy in the era of #XaviBall. After a laborious draw against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, and a narrow victory against Levante that Barca had no right to win, it’s clear that the side is still in its juvenile phase at best.
In particular, it’s suffered against a specific shape and play style. After some analysis, it appears no coincidence that Barca struggles when the opposition plays five defenders.
So having watched some games back, with a keen eye on the tactical nuances, I’ve listed a few key reasons why 5 is an unlucky number for Xavi’s Barcelona.
1.The numerical advantage is lost in buildup
Building up from the goalkeeper, Barcelona have consistently used a 2–3–5 setup. Both full backs go wide, the attacking midfielders are high up the pitch, and the wingers stay wide on either flank. The goal is to make the pitch big, stretch the opposition, and ultimately create space in the wide areas.
Because of the positions of the attacking midfielders, the opposing back four must stay compact. By moving the ball from side to side, Barca can easily find a full back or winger with plenty of space.
And with the centre forward occupying two centre backs, Barca have a free man when the opponents press aggressively.
A back five changes everything
However, when the opposition plays a back five, or three, the man advantage is lost. All of the front players are man-marked, plus the attacking midfielders. Here against Levante, you can see every player, bar the keeper, is accounted for.
Eintracht Frankfurt used a similar idea. But instead of man marking everywhere, they conceded the numerical advantage in the first third of the pitch in order to create their own advantage in the zone Barca loves to attack most: out wide.
The consistent problem here is that the back line cannot be stretched.
With five players defending, both wingers can be marked tightly regardless of where the ball is. No matter how much Barca move the ball looking for space, it will very rarely appear on the flanks.
So how should Barca play out from these scenarios? The answer leads us on to the next problem.
2. Barca’s forwards struggle to hold up the ball
When passing lanes are blocked and the wide players are marked, the emphasis must shift to the centre of the pitch. The most direct solution is to use a ‘third man run’.
This means finding the attacking midfielders indirectly, by going through the centre forward.
The image above is the ideal scenario. Aubameyang makes a run deep and has Pedri in support, who has also peeled off his marker — one of the centre backs. This is the benefit of having the attacking midfielders high and wide.
The theory is easy, the execution not so much. And Aubameyang has been having a torrid time recently trying to hold the ball up.
Unfortunately, neither Dembélé or Ferran Torres are particularly adept at doing this either (á la Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane). This makes a man-for-man approach very appealing for the opposition.
To summarise so far: a back five nullifies Plan A (to create space out wide), and forces Plan B (go direct into the forwards), which simply hasn’t been fruitful. And perhaps not suited to the current personnel.
So what’s Plan C? Well, here’s the third problem:
3. The system is too rigid
Or, in other words, there is no Plan C. And that’s understandable.
Xavi has modernised the way Barcelona play. It’s not an understatement, after the mediocrity of several managers (that won’t be named), to say that players have had to ‘re-learn’ the game. At least with regards to understanding positioning and movement.
With that in mind, and with the players taking on a new system, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they haven’t yet mastered the next stage: improvisation.
Because improvisation is key when Plan A and B don’t work. That, and a lot of quality.
I’m talking particularly about fluidity of role and movement. Manchester City are the kings of this. Despite having a very defined idea of how to attack, the players interchange positions and responsibilities effortlessly.
We got a glimpse of this in the second half against Levante, as Gavi and Pedri came on and introduced an element of unpredictability. Especially the former, who did something no other midfielder had even attempted: dribble past his marker.
This characteristic, fluidity, should quite naturally mature and evolve with time. It’s reasonable that this is a work in progress.
However, my final point is perhaps more concerning. Especially in the face of some big games before the end of the season:
4. Nobody is marking the wingbacks
If there’s one flaw that everyone has realised, it’s that Barca’s biggest weakness is their defensive transition.
Two of the reasons for this have been touched on already:
The first: the loss of possession through the centre forward. With wingers high and wide, and attacking midfielders supporting, Barca can be very short on numbers in transition. Busquets and Pique become especially exposed due to their lack of pace.
The second: Jordi Alba drifts wide. Usually, Barcelona try to prevent counter-attacks with a 2–3 shape that remains behind the ball. But when Jordi Alba, the leftmost of the ‘3’ breaks beyond the ball, this shape is broken and opposing forwards exploit the space.
The third reason is specific to the five-man backline. You can see it materialising in the image above, in the bottom right corner of the image. It’s the opposition wingback.
Against Frankfurt especially, it was clear Barca’s wingers were not instructed to track back. With the entire backline occupied by forwards, these marauding wingbacks created overloads time and again.
It was the same story against Levante, who should have made much more of their numerous overloads.
And so while Barcelona and Xavi have spent much of these first few months tweaking the offensive setup, more caution will need to be paid to this type of counter attack. Fortunately, the tactical solution seems easy enough: players work harder to get back.
Whether anything more can be done about it (aside from making tactical fouls) remains to be seen.
Despite everything I’ve highlighted, things still look overwhelmingly positive for Barcelona. The speed in which Xavi has implemented his system, and the players have understood it, is credit to his coaching ability.
However, this project is still a work-in-progress. Come the summer, personnel will change, the squad will look different, and things will evolve again. Whether Xavi can fix these problems problems immediately will be a big test of his managerial prowess. But based on his record so far, I wouldn’t bet against him.
If you enjoy these tactical analyses, please give a ‘clap’ and follow the page!

Greetings, football enthusiasts! Today, I’m taking you on a timeless journey through one of FC Barcelona’s unforgettable nights. Join me to discover the magic that unfolded in the clash against Chelsea (2009), a night engraved in the annals of football history.
“Each second felt like an eternity”
The story begins in a hub of pure excitement. Chelsea already led 1-0, and Barça faced a mountain to climb. At that time, as a 12-year-old schoolboy, I returned from school with indescribable excitement. I couldn’t wait to see how my heroes would tackle this colossal challenge.
I remember sticking to the TV, still wearing my school uniform, eagerly anticipating the spectacle. It was more than just a match for me; it was an immersive experience, a magical interlude in my adolescence.
As the match progressed, stress mounted. Every whistle, every pause in play, everything seemed to decide Barça’s fate. My heart raced; each second felt like an eternity.
Then came the 93rd minute, a moment etched in my mind. Andrés Iniesta, the football genius, triggered an explosion of emotions. I remember leaping with joy, unable to contain the excitement. It was a moment of deliverance, where football transcended the sport to become a pure emotional experience.
Let’s be honest—beyond the scoreboard, there were refereeing decisions that could have altered the narrative. As a fan, I couldn’t help but acknowledge the whims of fate. Football, with its imperfections, added to the drama of that unforgettable night.
Ultimately, beyond the scoreboard, it was a fan’s journey—a roller coaster of emotions, from doubt to belief, from anxiety to jubilation. Join me next time to relive other unforgettable football moments.
Don’t forget to subscribe, and share your own stories in the comments. Until next time, keep the football spirit alive!
This is Stanley,

Hey readers, don't forget to watch the YouTube link of the immersive experience at the end of Camp Nou tour. It’s amazing and you’ll want to watch it over and over! https://youtu.be/n9vXBp5rQfA don't miss out sure to watch it !
As an avid traveller, I’m always searching for the heart of a city, that unique pulse that goes beyond the typical tourist trail. In Barcelona, I found it not just in the architectural wonders, but within the hallowed walls of Camp Nou.
While I didn’t get to witness the electrifying energy of a live match, the tour of FC Barcelona’s legendary stadium was an experience in itself. From the moment I approached the colossal structure, I felt the weight of football history. Camp Nou isn’t just a stadium its mesmerising almost feeling hypnotised.
Walking through the stadium, I could almost hear the echoes of roaring crowds and the legendary players who graced that pitch. The sheer scale of the place is breath taking. Standing on the side lines, imagining the thrill of a packed stadium, gave me goose bumps. Visiting the changing rooms, walking through the tunnel the players use, and seeing the press box all provided a unique perspective.
The museum offered a fascinating glimpse into the club’s rich history, showcasing trophies, iconic jerseys, and the stories behind Barcelona’s greatest moments. It’s a testament to the club’s legacy and its deep connection to the city.
Even without a match, Camp Nou vibrated with an almost palpable energy. It’s a place where passion and history collide. To top it all off, the tour concluded with a truly immersive 360-degree cinematic experience ( link at the top of this article make sure to watch it), putting me right in the heart of the action with all the legendary players. It was an incredible way to feel the pulse of the team. This entire experience gave me a deeper understanding of Barcelona, a city where football is more than just a sport; it’s an integral part of the culture.
So, if you’re visiting Barcelona, make sure to add Camp Nou to your itinerary. Whether you’re a die-hard football fan or simply curious, a tour of this iconic stadium is an unforgettable experience. It’s a chance to connect with the soul of the city and understand why football is so much more than just a game.
A trip you need to definitely add to your bucket list!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
I am on my way to the airport as I started writing this.
A few days ago, I flew to Spain to begin the first leg of my solo trip around Europe. There’s no deeper reason why I’m taking this trip except I know that, whatever the outcome is, I need to do it and it will reveal its beautiful purpose in time.
It’s too early to write my reflections about my experience, and there is definitely so much to be written. But, I’m about to fly out of Spain today to my next destination, and I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by the kindness around me, especially that I am far from home.
From that metro guy who brought out his phone to use Google Translate so he could better give me instructions,
that other passenger who help me carry my luggage upstairs because I didn’t know you can go around and maybe find a lift,
that guy from Albania on a holiday who walked me to the bus stop ‘coz I’ve been literally going circles, looking for my ride to my hostel,
that guy from Germany, who was also on a holiday, but who explained the route of the bus I took to assure me and who also made suggestions on what touristy things I should do,
my roommates from Egypt, Brazil, and Chile who already feel like long-time friends, offering help and suggesting to meet up again in my next destinations,
Viki from Hungary, who provided me company on my first day, sharing stories as well as the same love for sports and dogs,
Mary Margaret from the US, who helped me book a tour and let me pay her in cash because my card wouldn’t work for online purchases because of its registered local number,
Miquel, a true blue Catalan from Esparreguera who adjusted his sched so I could go hiking in Montserrat — the reason why I added Barcelona to this trip,
all the fellow tourists and travelers who offered to take my photo (regardless if they turned out good shots or not) because I was alone,
the Spanish girl who lives near my hostel who taught me the best way to the airport,
David, a guy from Slovenia who works at the hostel, who gleefully (but not sure if legally) offered to keep my luggage and carry-on bag at the storage room free of charge for two days,
the ladies at the buses and the metro who weren’t articulate in English but still entertained my questions and went out of their way so we could find the lift for my heavy luggage,
the guy on the wheelchair, who was, of course, an expert to accessing the elevators, who kept on reminding me not to ride the train that runs through the same line as the train to the airport,
the Spanish girl who sat closer to my luggage at the airport terminal when I had to leave and check my flight details on the screen, and who then told me where to find assistance.
I have been just less than a week away, and I have many people to thank for — especially my family. But let me start with these strangers. I hope I got to know all their names and keep communication, but it warms my heart to think that even strangers can play magical cameos in anyone’s life.
When I arrived in Spain, I knew that getting lost should be enjoyed just as much as getting to one’s destination in a breeze. And true enough, I got lost, I doubted my direction and decisions multiple times, but I survive, learning lessons and making memories.
I am about to leave Spain, convinced that the world is beautiful. Yes, because Barcelona and Catalonia are a sight to behold. But more so, because of the kindness all around us.

Barcelona is a city I visited without many expectations, but I saw how wrong I was. Before the trip, my knowledge was limited only something such as urban planning, building structures, big Gaudi’s structures, football club and generic things. But after spending three days there, I felt like I could actually live in Barcelona.
I want to share my experience and what I learned when I walked through the city. There are still some places I couldn’t visit; unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time. In this writing, I shared only some places that I went.
First, I gave a 3-day trip itinerary. Then, I explained each place in detail, organized by category.
Start your journey in the heart of the old city, dive into Gothic architecture.
Explore the green side of Barcelona with views, art, and calm spaces, plus a beautiful evening at the beach.
Today is all about imagination, emotion, and big symbols of Barcelona’s identity.
I organized my trip into the following categories:
🏰 Historical & Architectural Landmarks
1.Baslica de la Sagrada Famlia
The Basílica de la Sagrada Família is one of the most iconic landmarks in Barcelona and the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world. Designed by Antoni Gaudí, it looks like something out of a fairytale with its towering spires and intricate facades. Construction began back in 1882 and is still ongoing today.
Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect born in 1852 in Catalonia. He studied architecture in Barcelona and became known for his innovative use of materials and structures. Gaudí worked on several major projects, including Park Güell, Casa Batlló, and the Sagrada Família, which he focused on from 1883 until his death in 1926.
Gaudí didn’t start the Sagrada Família project himself — it was already planned as a Catholic church by a local organization called the Spiritual Association of Devotees of Saint Joseph. They wanted to build a church dedicated to the Holy Family (Sagrada Família) to promote Christian values in response to the rise of secularism.
Gaudí took over the project in 1883, after the original architect resigned. He saw it as a chance to combine his deep Catholic faith with architecture. For Gaudí, the church wasn’t just a building — it was a way to tell the story of Christianity through art, structure, and symbolism. He dedicated the last 40 years of his life to it, turning it into his life’s mission.
If you want to see the inside, it’s best to buy your ticket at least a week in advance.
2. Baslica de Santa Maria del Mar
The Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar is a beautiful Gothic church built in the 1300s by local sailors and merchants. It feels peaceful and grand inside, with tall stone columns and soft natural light. Tucked in the heart of El Born, it’s a quiet gem full of history and charm.
3. Baslica de Santa Maria del Pi
The Basílica de Santa Maria del Pi was built in the early 1300s and finished around 1391. It’s a quiet Gothic church in the middle of the old town, named after a pine tree that once grew nearby. With its tall bell tower and simple stone walls, it’s a peaceful place to rest and enjoy a bit of history.
Both churches were built in the 1300s and look Gothic, but they feel different inside. Santa Maria del Mar is brighter and more open, while Santa Maria del Pi feels stronger and a bit darker.
4. Cathedral of Barcelona
The Cathedral of Barcelona, also called the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia, was built between the 13th and 15th centuries. It’s a grand Gothic church with tall spires, stone carvings, and a peaceful cloister inside. Right outside is Plaça de la Seu, a lovely square where people often sit, watch street performers, or take photos of the cathedral’s front.
5. Palau Reial Major
The Palau Reial Major was the royal palace of the counts of Barcelona and later the kings of Aragon. It was mainly built between the 13th and 15th centuries and sits in the Gothic Quarter. Today, you can explore its old stone halls and the Plaça del Rei in front, a quiet square that feels full of medieval history.
In this narrow area, I felt a deeper connection to history.
6. Palau de la Generalitat
The Palau de la Generalitat is the seat of the Catalan government and has been used for that purpose since the 1400s. It has a mix of Gothic and Renaissance styles and is still a working government building today. You’ll find it on Plaça de Sant Jaume, right across from the City Hall.
In the square in front of this building we saw an old man talking about how much damage tourists were doing to Barcelona.
We saw a “tourists go home” protest in Barcelona. However, a touristic environment was created throughout the city and apart from this person, I did not see any attitude towards tourists; on the contrary, everyone was very interested.
7. Barcelona City Hall
Barcelona City Hall, also known as Casa de la Ciutat, has been the city’s main government building since the 14th century. Its front mixes Gothic and Neoclassical styles, showing how the city changed over time. It faces the Palau de la Generalitat on Plaça de Sant Jaume, a square full of history and political life.
8. Casa Batlló
Casa Batlló is one of Antoni Gaudí’s most famous works, designed in 1904. The building looks like something from a dream, with colorful tiles, flowing shapes, and a roof that looks like a dragon’s back. It’s on Passeig de Gràcia and often called the “House of Bones” because of its bone-like balconies and windows.
9. La Pedrera — Casa Milà
La Pedrera, also known as Casa Milà, was designed by Antoni Gaudí and finished in 1912. Its wavy stone façade and twisted iron balconies make it look like a moving piece of art. The rooftop, with its strange chimney shapes, is one of the most unique spots in Barcelona.
As I saw these works of Gaudi, they changed my perception a lot as they differed from other works of art.
10. Monument als Castellers
The Monument als Castellers represents the traditional Catalan practice of building human towers, called castells. These towers are made by people standing on each other’s shoulders, sometimes reaching up to 10 levels high. The sculpture shows the strength, teamwork, and trust needed to create these towers — core values of Catalan culture.
11. The World Comes To Life With Each Kiss
The mural “The World Begins With Every Kiss” (El món neix en cada besada) symbolizes love, freedom, and unity. Created in 2014 by photographer Joan Fontcuberta and ceramist Antoni Cumella, it commemorates the 300th anniversary of Barcelona’s fall during the War of the Spanish Succession. The artwork comprises 4,000 ceramic tiles, each featuring photographs submitted by citizens depicting personal moments of freedom. Together, these images form a mosaic of two people kissing, representing the enduring spirit of love and resilience in the face of adversity.
A nice area to take photos.
12. Camp Nou
The Camp Nou is FC Barcelona’s iconic stadium, originally opened on September 24, 1957. Camp Nou, FC Barcelona’s iconic stadium, is currently undergoing major renovations to expand its capacity to 105,000 and modernize its facilities.
I think they design great museums to introduce their teams. Additionally, it was amazing to see the Champions League trophy with my own eyes.
🏞️ Parks, Viewpoints & Nature
13. Montjuc & Montjuïc Castle
Montjuïc became a key part of Barcelona’s growth and global image in the 20th century. Many of its buildings and spaces were first developed for the 1929 International Exposition, a world fair that helped show off the city’s culture and progress. Later, in 1992, the area was transformed again to host the Summer Olympic Games, bringing new life to old buildings and adding new sports facilities.
Today, Montjuïc is a mix of history, art, and nature. You can visit the Montjuïc Castle, explore museums like the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC), walk through peaceful gardens, or watch the light show at the Magic Fountain. It’s a place where locals and visitors come to relax, learn, and enjoy some of the best views in the city.
14. Plaça de les Cascades
Plaça de les Cascades is a beautiful square in Barcelona, located just below the National Art Museum of Catalonia on Montjuïc Hill. Built for the 1929 International Exposition, it features a series of cascading fountains that lead up to the museum, creating a stunning visual effect. The square is a popular spot for visitors to relax and enjoy the views of the city.
15. Ciutadella Park
Ciutadella Park is one of the most loved green spaces in Barcelona, perfect for relaxing, walking, or enjoying a boat ride on the lake. It was once a military area but turned into a public park in the 1800s. On weekends, the park comes alive with events, music, and people dancing near the big fountain.
It easily ranks in my top 5 favorites.
16. Park Güell
Park Güell is a colourful and imaginative park designed by Antoni Gaudí, built between 1900 and 1914. Originally planned as a housing development, it became a public park filled with winding paths, mosaic-covered benches, and playful architecture. Today, it’s one of Barcelona’s most iconic spots and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It costs 18 euros, but totally worth it.
17. Barceloneta Beach — Playa de la Barceloneta
Barceloneta Beach is one of Barcelona’s most famous and lively beaches, located in the old fishing neighborhood of La Barceloneta. It was transformed in the early 1990s for the Olympic Games, turning into a wide, sandy beach with a long promenade. Today, it’s a favorite spot for sunbathing, swimming, beach volleyball, and enjoying fresh seafood at the nearby chiringuitos. The beach is also known for its vibrant atmosphere, with street performers, music, and people dancing along the promenade, especially in the evenings.
PERFECT!!!
It was full even though we didn’t go swimming. I can’t imagine summer.
🖼️ Museums & Cultural Sites
18. Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya
The Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC) was built for the 1929 International Exposition to show off Catalan culture and art. It’s located in the Palau Nacional on Montjuïc Hill, a grand building that became the perfect home for a national museum. Today, it holds one of the best collections of Romanesque art in the world, along with Gothic, Renaissance, and modern works.
⛲ Monuments & Squares
19. Plaça d’Espanya
Plaça d’Espanya is one of Barcelona’s largest and most important squares, built in 1929 for the International Exposition. It was designed to impress visitors and serve as a grand entrance to Montjuïc, connecting major roads like Gran Via and Avinguda del Paral·lel.
20. Plaça de Catalunya
Plaça de Catalunya is the central square of Barcelona, connecting the old city with the modern Eixample district. Inaugurated in 1927, it covers 5 hectares and serves as a major hub for transport, shopping, and city life. Surrounded by shops, cafes, and fountains, it’s a popular meeting point for both locals and visitors.
21. Plaça Reial
Plaça Reial is a lively square in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, just off La Rambla. Built in the mid-1800s on the site of a former convent, it was designed to honor the monarchy. The square features palm trees, elegant arches, and a central fountain called the Three Graces. Notably, the ornate lampposts were among Antoni Gaudí’s first public works. Today, Plaça Reial is a popular spot for dining, nightlife, and enjoying open-air events.
If you are looking for a nice place to eat, I recommend this place.
22. Plaça de la Vila de Madrid
Plaça de la Vila de Madrid is a peaceful square in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, known for its hidden Roman cemetery. In the 1950s, during construction, archaeologists uncovered 85 Roman tombs dating from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. These graves belonged mostly to ordinary people — freedmen, slaves, and lower-class citizens — who were buried along a road leading out of the ancient Roman city of Barcino. Today, visitors can view the tombs from a raised walkway and learn more at the small museum on site.
23. Arc de Triomf
The Arc de Triomf is a big red-brick arch built in 1888 for a world fair held in Barcelona. It wasn’t made for war, but to welcome people from around the world. Today, it’s a popular place to walk, take photos, and enjoy the wide promenade that leads to Ciutadella Park.
🛍️ Markets & Shopping Streets
24. Mercat de la Boqueria
La Boqueria Market is Barcelona’s most famous food market, found right on La Rambla. It started way back in the 1200s and became a proper market in the 1800s. Today, you can walk through colorful stalls, try local street food, fresh fruit, and even grab some tasty tapas.
25. La Rambla
La Rambla is a famous street in the center of Barcelona, running from Plaça de Catalunya down to the sea. It’s always full of life, with street performers, small shops, cafés, and flower stands. It’s a fun place to walk, grab a snack, and feel the city’s energy.
🚡 Rides & Attractions
26. Telefric de Montjuc
The Telefèric de Montjuïc is a scenic cable car ride in Barcelona that takes you from Montjuïc Park up to Montjuïc Castle. Opened in 1970 and upgraded in 2007, it offers panoramic views of the city and the sea. The ride has three stops: Parc de Montjuïc, Mirador, and Castell.
27. Transportation Tickets
🍽️ Food & Drink Spots
28. Les Quinze Nits
Located in Plaa Reial, this popular spot offers quality Mediterranean dishes at great prices. The atmosphere is lively, especially at night with the lights of the square.
29. TKO Tacos Barna
A fun place to grab flavorful, creative tacos with a twist. A cool mix of Mexican street food and Barcelona’s chill vibe.
30. El Tastet de l’Artur
A cozy, local eatery known for authentic Catalan dishes. It’s a hidden gem where you can enjoy a more traditional, homemade meal.
31. Gelati Dino
One of the best spots in the city for gelato! With lots of flavors and smooth texture, it’s the perfect treat during a hot afternoon walk.
🛏️ Hostels & Accommodation

When we talk about football clubs, Spanish football clubs, especially FC Barcelona, come to mind. FC Barcelona has emerged as one of the biggest and most renowned football clubs in the world. Let’s take a journey into the development of FC Barcelona and how they have continuously adapted to the demands of the times.
FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by Joan Gamper and has since become an important part of Barcelona’s culture and history. FC Barcelona shares a strong connection with Catalonia, as it has emerged as a rallying point for Catalan identity, providing a platform for the expression of Catalan aspirations. The club’s motto, “Mes que un club” (More than a club), reflects its social, cultural, and political impact. This identity has evolved over time, solidifying the club as a symbol of resistance and Catalan identity.
One of the most visible aspects of FC Barcelona is their playing style. They embrace a philosophy of beautiful football and ball dominance, known as “tiki-taka.” This style of play is a developed and perfected version of “Total Football” popularized by former Barcelona manager, Johan Cruyff. Cruyff’s influence and tactical approach laid the foundation of FC Barcelona’s philosophy.
Later, under the guidance of coaches Louis van Gaal and especially Pep Guardiola, FC Barcelona refined and implemented the tiki-taka style to its fullest potential. Guardiola played a significant role in promoting and developing “tiki-taka” during his successful tenure as Barcelona’s head coach from 2008 to 2012, collecting 14 major trophies.
The development of FC Barcelona is not limited to their playing style. They have also strengthened their youth player development structure and established the renowned football academy, La Masia. In recent years, Barcelona has also enhanced their approach to using technology and data analysis to improve team performance. They are currently renovating their stadium, now called Spotify Camp Nou.
FC Barcelona’s development is also reflected in their history of success. The club has won numerous domestic and international titles, including La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. They have had star players like Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, and many more who have become symbols of Barcelona’s dominance.
FC Barcelona has undergone a remarkable evolution over time, both in terms of playing style and as a social institution. The combination of visionary coaching, skilled players, and a commitment to the club’s philosophy led to the mastery of tiki-taka at Barcelona. They continuously adapt to the changing times and follow the path of remarkable development. FC Barcelona is not just a football club; it is a symbol of spirit, identity, and values that define them, just like their motto, “Mes Que Un Club” (More Than a Club).

A personal reflection on the unexpected, hours-long power outage that left Spain and parts of two other countries in the dark.
It’s been four days since the blackout. Though I took plenty of notes on the day itself, it wasn’t until I read someone else’s reflection that I felt moved to write my own.
It all began around 10:30 a.m. I’d just finished a call with two teammates, where we broke down a large epic into smaller user stories for the next day’s refinement session. That meeting had been one of my main focuses — finalizing those stories would free up my time later in the week while the development team started the development of those tasks.
The night before, a quiet Sunday, I’d gone to bed early. Lying there, I mentally outlined my week. Writing those stories was at the top of my Monday to-do list. So, after the meeting, I grabbed my draft notes and a glass of water, ready for a deep-focus session. But Jira wasn’t updating. My Wi-Fi had disconnected. Odd, but not entirely unusual, as my home connection can be temperamental.
I went to the kitchen. The room felt strangely dark, so I reached for the light switch. Nothing. That’s when I realised the electricity was out.
Our neighbour has been doing construction work for months, so my first assumption was that they’d accidentally cut a line. I stepped outside and asked,“Excuse me, I noticed I have no electricity. Are you working on anything that might’ve caused it?”“It’s not just you,” he said. “The whole street’s out.”
Strange. A few months back, a nearby building caught fire, and we briefly lost power, but this felt different. I still had mobile data, so I messaged my team to let them know I was offline trying to figure it out what was going home with power at home. One colleague replied, saying he’d also lost power, and he lives far from me. I wrote back:“Hey, is this happening across Barcelona?”He responded: “I have friends in Badalona and Madrid going through the same.”
Just then, my partner arrived from the gym. Before I could say anything, he told me he’d stopped by the supermarket but couldn’t buy anything, no electricity, no card payments.
My thoughts began racing. Was this just local? A regional outage? I checked the news: barely two or three headlines. No one knew the cause yet.
I decided to stay calm and wait for a few more minutes. I was constantly checking the WiFi to see if there were any chances of it being back yet.
I tried calling a friend. The connection was poor, but her voice crackled through:“It’s horrible, isn’t it? I can’t hear you well.” She mentioned GPS was still working, so she was heading home, adjusting to her new commute after recently moving.
She was okay but had to hang up, her husband was calling from Vilanova i la Geltrú. That made me pause. A colleague had mentioned Madrid, but the news hadn’t confirmed anything. If her husband in Vilanova was calling about the blackout, this wouldn’t normalise in only a few minutes, it was spreading. Or already had.
I checked in with my partner. He seemed calm, which made me second-guess my own growing anxiety. I appreciated his steadiness, but the total lack of urgency worried me too. He began messaging friends using mobile data. Some confirmed that France wasn’t affected, but Sitges was also out. Could this be a cyberattack?
By now, I’d lost mobile signal entirely.
I opened the fridge: bare. We had enough leftover for maybe a day. Living in the city center, we usually buy fresh groceries daily. No need to stockpile.
My partner saw the look on my face and began filling some water bottles. I checked our cupboards: some rice, a bit of pasta, not much more than that. Thankfully, we had a gas cooktop. I rummaged for cash: around €20 in a jar of travel coins, another €30 in my wallet. That would have to do.
But what to buy? Some food for today and tomorrow, of course, but besides that? What was I preparing for?
A few weeks ago, I’d bought a pack of 100 candles for my night routines, reading and journaling by candlelight. At least we were set for lighting. I praised myself for that. We debated how to get updates. Would a radio be too much? Were we overreacting?
I reminded myself this wasn’t local. Multiple cities were affected. We decided to go out and see how the neighbourhood was coping.
Around 1:20 PM. We took the stairs, five flights down, in pitch black. No emergency lights. I won’t lie, that terrified me. I regretted not calling my family in Brazil before losing signal.
Outside, neighbours were talking, but no one had answers. We walked around the neighbourhood. Major supermarkets like Ametller and Caprabo were closed. Corner stores were open, with lines forming outside. People were buying toilet paper, water, radios and candles.
2:30 PM. At one building entrance, a doorman said their power was back. Ours still wasn’t. Why would some buildings have power while others didn’t? I assumed hospitals had generators, but what about regular residential buildings?
Being outside helped. I felt calmer even though the streets were not still. Public transport had stopped: the train, tram, and metro. Only buses were still running, and that’s why the lines were getting stupidly longer. People looked stressed, overchecking their phones, but frustrated with the lack of signal.
From another perspective, there were still some people sunbathing, while others drank beer on terraces. Some kind of Woodstock in the middle of an apocalypse?
We skipped the long queues and wandered further until we found a small store with no line. We bought canned beans and pasta, enough for today and tomorrow.
At the entrance, a woman was controlling how many people entered. Inside, it was dark. They were using flashlights and calculators, only accepting cash. It felt surreal.
Around 3:00 PM. We noticed a few places still had power, including a small café near Sagrada Familia, and the hospital of course. But most of the city was still out. The ATMS in our way were offline. There was a single one close to a hospital that had a huge line; we considered entering it, but decided not to; we still had a small amount of money after the groceries.
Back home, we climbed the stairs again. We had food. Water. Candles. We decided not to buy the radio, and only wait until later that night or even tomorrow. There wasn’t much more we could do.
I lay on the sofa and finally finished a book I’d started a month ago. My partner opened an old box he hadn’t touched in a year and started organising it.
Later, we talked. Made theories. What would we do in another lockdown? Would we stay in the city or move to the countryside? Buy a car? Rent first? For how long? Just possibilities. Playing out with that amount of extra time we suddenly gained for our Monday, together, in the quiet.
We cooked. We ate. It was still early.
The power had gone out at 10:30 a.m. It wouldn’t come back until nightfall. At 9:30 p.m I was in bed, calming down the nerves of that day and expecting that life would be back to normal in the morning.
I woke up at night, not exactly at what time, and noticed one light from the living was on. I didn’t do the effort to go and turn it off. Somehow it helped me to feel safe.
That day reminded me how little we control, and how much we take for granted. The ability to cook. To call loved ones. To pay for food. To know what’s happening in the world. It was all suspended.
It’s been four days since the episode. There is still no conclusions on what might have caused the European Blackout.
In the stillness of the power outage, something became clear: maybe we do need to prepare ourselves better for unknowns, not with panic, but with presence, healthy discussions, and perspective. Some things are really just out of our control. Important time to think on how we’ve been connected – or not – to the world around us.
In any case, I always knew those 100 candles would come in handy.
If you found this story meaningful or have questions about what happened that day, I’d love to hear from you. Drop a comment — I’m happy to share more.

Barcelona 2023/24— The end to Xavi’s successful but complicated stint.,https://medium.com/@Am10talk/barcelona-2023-24-the-distasteful-end-to-xavis-successful-era-48e41063687e,"Sign up

On November 6th 2021, Xavi Hernández Creus, one of Barcelona’s biggest legends and best midfielders ever, was appointed as the manager of FC Barcelona following the sacking of previous manager and club legend, Ronald Koeman — after a run of poor results, caused by the lack of identity and dynamism in football, that led to Barcelona being 9th on the La-Liga table when he was relieved of his said duties.
Xavi took the same team, with a couple of reinforcements in the following January transfer window of 2022, took the same team to 2nd place with an impressive period — playing some fluid and entertaining football, and also beating Real Madrid 4–0 in the process, ensuring the first El Clasico win since Ernesto Valverde’s departure.
The football witnessed initially under Xavi seemed very refreshing to a fanbase that had witnessed consistently underwhelming seasons of football prior to this — which prompted hyperbolic conversations regarding him being the ‘2nd coming of Pep Guardiola’.
He instilled an identity — provided a tactical foundation to a squad that lacked it very much; he deployed a 4–3–3, a more direct version than the conventional Barcelona style, but an entertaining and fluid style due to how the players inter-connected and understood their environment, which declined overtime due to the departures of some of the key ‘connectors’.
The following season (2022/23) — Barcelona proceeded to win La-Liga and the Spanish Super Cup very convincingly. Barcelona opted to play the box-midfield (midfield of 4) gradually as the season passed by, which helped neuter some of Barcelona’s core issues in the league, but were again exposed in some of the European nights (like Manchester United, Inter Milan).
Although Barcelona suffered a UCL group stage exit that season, the feelings around Xavi’s future / tenure were very positive, especially going into next season. Most seemed convinced that he was Barcelona’s man long-term. But, things went downhill this season with Barcelona’s levels of performance completely regressing while also going trophy-less, overall.
“Signing Xavi Is The Best Decision I’ve Ever Made Since I Became President”
These were the words of Joan Laporta, the Club President in April 2022, and in over 2 years — On 24th May, FC Barcelona announced that Xavi’s last game in charge as manager will be against Sevilla (the last game of the season) and he will not be continuing next season. There’s been such a drastic change in the perception of him as a manager over a year, something must’ve changed, and something did change.
Barcelona’s feelings coming into this season were relatively positive; the aim for this season was clear — an establishment of threat in Europe while maintaining the impressive domestic success we possessed, but did no one see coming this level of regression with regards to our overall style of play, rather than just losing out on trophies due to marginal differences.
Barcelona’s board parted ways with the previous sporting director, Jordi Cruyff (son of Johan Cruyff) and appointed Deco as the new sporting director; The club also parted ways with Mateu Alemany — which, essentially meant there was more responsibility in Yuste’s and Laporta’s hands — which was unhealthy, because neither have the credentials to be holding authority involving them to make sporting decisions.
Now, certain issues seemed to come with the power gradient — there was a lack of respect / consideration with respect to the manager’s decisions / preferences when it came to certain decisions that’d affect the manager the most, like the Vitor Roque situation. No board should sign a player with a manager you’re aiming to keep when he’s insisting against a particular signing, because it becomes unhealthy within the board & for the player’s future, as well.
A few issues became seemingly clear, and primarily, it was the unwarranted amount of influence Jorge Mendes (the agent) possessed on Barcelona’s footballing operations, when in reality — he has no authority to have such grave involvement, and it brings in an inherent level of bias in transfer operations, that could result in Barcelona settling for players with Mendes as agent, despite them being suboptimal for Barcelona’s squad, like the pressure make the Cancelo / Felix deals permanent, the heavy links with Ruben Neves last season etc.
So, in reality, there has always been suboptimal conditions in terms of board structuring and planning that can make it infeasible for managers to succeed at this club, and it was made much worse with the departures of Jordi Cruyff and especially, Mateu Alemany.
The handling of certain situations — including Xavi’s sacking has been extremely poor from the board. Poor treatment of personnel who genuinely commit their all towards the betterment of the club is an attitude that cannot last long at a club such as this, and will / can ultimately lead to the downfall of this particular mandate.
This was a ‘decent’ transfer window considering the financial limitations and there was a good initiative to complete sales of players that weren’t exactly contributing to the club in anyway, anymore. Oriol Romeu seemed like a very good signing at first, but it didn’t go as planned as the season went on due to confidence issues and also primarily — systematic issues that aggregated his flaws and didn’t provide him suitable conditions to succeed.
Felix and Cancelo seemed to be decent reinforcements due to their high technical potential and talent. The issue came with Cancelo’s and Felix’s mental profiles — often ignorant, unwarrantedly complex, reckless, more flair, less effectiveness, which, as expected, led to improper application of their high technical qualities and inconsistent showings in possession, combined with poor showings in general out of possession;
Regardless, Ilkay Gundogan, hands down, proved to be Barcelona’s best signing for this season by a mile. A footballer of the highest level — mentally, physically and technically. He is a true Swiss-Army Knife in every sense of the word due to how versatile, resilient and intelligent he is.
Transfers regarding personnel has been decent at best, but the overall squad planning and direction regarding overall club’s structure has been unconvincing and seems very unsustainable due to the lack of rational basis behind most decisions this particular dispensation has made. Far too ‘individualistic’ and preference-based without looking at the overall larger picture.
Despite current transfer planning / direction being slightly off, the investment in youth for the B team has been pretty impressive, especially under Deco, with signings like Noah Darvich, Ibrahim Diarra and Mikayil Faye. Although, there’s no balance with respect to elevating the 1st team while doing it sustainably on a financial level — hence, the lack of direction and planning I stated.
It’s been a disappointing season overall, from Barcelona, in the tactical domain, on both offensive and defensive fronts. As shown in a graph created by “Markstats” on X :
Barcelona’s deep entries in the opposition graph has massively declined while the opposition deep entries increased as the season progressed. Although, it is very important to note that most teams don’t look to threaten Barcelona through consistent entries / pressure in their box, rather — they use transitions / counter-attacks to try and exploit / attack Barcelona’s defense. But, Barcelona, being a dominant team in possession, in La-Liga, not being able to create enough deep entries, and it going to an extent that it’s not too dissimilar as opposition deep entries suggests poor effectiveness in and, also out of possession.
Barcelona’s issues this season showcase the fact that Xavi is an inexperienced coach with ideas that need proper maturing, multi-dimensionality and clarity in implication. It could, either, be an issue regarding a lack of transcendence of the ideas clearly or a lack of applying these ideas properly, or both — either way, both are co-related mechanisms. Let’s get into some detail.
Barcelona didn’t change much, in terms of their structural base or their formation in terms of positioning. There was a continuation on the 4–3–3 with often one forming a double pivot in build-up, as done last season, except it became more rigid, and horizontal relative to its surroundings. The reasoning is definitely due to Busquets’ departure — which essentially meant that Barcelona needed more dynamism / technical prowess in build-up, without a Busquets.
The replacement came in the form of Romeu, and the build-up responsibility gradually shifted more to Frenkie De Jong with Romeu assisting in build-up. Barcelona seemed ineffective on a consistent basis when it came to enabling effective progression when playing against opposition presses and already seemed to hit some road-blocks regarding fluidity last season, especially in terms of de-compacting opposition defenses (like Inter) but, this season, it got much, much worse.
What seemed to be the issue was — Barcelona had a structural idea in mind, but were incompetent in executing or even understanding how to utilize / implicate the structure to progress efficiently. Barcelona were too rigid / unpredictable, because of an obvious lack in fluidity.
This came due to one major factor, and that’s the DISTANCING. The distances between players became much larger to try and gain positional / numerical advantages, but it came at a cost of compromising for compactness and fluidity.
There was often the lack of an extra receiver between the lines, and instead there was an increased emphasis on playing extremely direct passes which came with the intent of exploiting space that exists, not creating or controlling. This can also be validated by how often Barcelona have to go long to feed runners, or put it on top of defenses to feed runners that does not sustain because it is a high ‘variance’ style and also, an easily readable and predictable style.
It also clearly explains how Pau Cubarsi’s inclusion has made Barcelona much more efficient on the ball — due to his immaculate tactical awareness and manipulation using his body language and footwork which results in creation of gaps / openings of lanes through which Barcelona can find a player better, like how Cubarsi often opens up the middle of the pitch to find Lewandowski directly.
Players do not move in closer proximities to combine, create space and release to the runners. Rather, Barcelona try to do the latter before-hand which is ineffective due to the opposition still maintaining numbers at the back, and the lack of proximity which can undermine the level of reception, and provide a higher risk to the pass.
This showcased the fact that this team had not culminated a set of consistent principles / a basis of automation in possession that would help them play through the opposition and utilize the potential of their structural knowledge into something much more useful and effective.
A conundrum that Barcelona often found themselves is that they were not given the clarity on when to keep the ball, how to keep the ball, and why to keep the ball. What leads to players playing extremely direct passes, and often turning games into chaos is a clear lack of clarity with regards to collective intent, and how to approach the game. That, combined with the larger distances between players, leads to what we call as — over-verticality.
Barcelona have become increasingly rigid in its style of play — a great example being, how often players out wide are completely isolated and have no pathway but to complete their take on, or lose the ball and concede a turnover — which made Balde an easy target to retrieve possession off if Barcelona ever went out wide to him, because he’s not a 1v1 monster; rather, he’s someone that would thrive on more rotations when wide, and more license to carry in the middle — that’s been clearly failed to be addressed due to the high and wide policy of our full-backs in build-up and attacking phases.
The rigidity and lack of fluidity transcends onto why the particular idea of Xavi’s Barcelona are so reliant / obsessed on / with 1v1 dribblers (Yamal / Dembele), and that’s primarily because that’s Barcelona’s only pathway (often) to creating space or progressing out wide due to the lack of rotations, when the whole idea of exploiting said ‘openings’ leads to not much good in the era of modern football due to the increasing amounts of compact defenses — opposition teams are constricting space very well and as often as possible.
There aren’t enough rotations, whether it is deep with the full-backs and midfielders, or whether it’s ahead with the wingers and full-backs. The rigidity prompts individual prowess and spontaneous solution-finding that leads to unreliability / inconsistencies in possession and often a chaotic style against better teams — because the players are playing at their own rhythm, understanding and intent, due to the lack of a collective idea of execution — which shows the lack of a principle base.
The lack of movement has caused Barcelona to become a static and predictable side, lacking basic combinations in possession due to rigid occupation of zones, rather than arrival and exchange of zones between players, often leading to predictable and pointless sideways circulation / forced passes forward to win 2nd balls or over the top of the last line.
The reason Barcelona look much more fluid with Pedri and looked more fluid with Busquets because these two players had a clearer picture of how to progress and play as a collective with the ball — they tried to receive and create shorter distances, dictate movements on the pitch and tried to retain possession when possible, as well.
Their INTENT was / is to extert control on the pitch, which is something Barcelona have massively lacked this season. There’s no quest for territory — that has led to the patchy form this season. Lack of territorial control leads to a game-model with high variance, which is basically, you don’t control enough possibilities to narrow games down to your favour and leave it out more in the open.
This can be validated by some of Barcelona’s poor field tilt statistics against competent opposition :
— Against Athletic Bilbao on March 4th (36.4%) — Against Real Madrid (30.1%) — Against PSG 1st leg (30.0%)
Barcelona play into chaos too much — there is such lack of re-organization for the team to even play in settled possession and when they do, these are the conundrums they face in possession. It’s very unlike a usual Barcelona team, to be honest.
To sum it up — lack of clarity, lack of emphasis on being more risk-averse, controlling and sustaining attacks / pressure has led to an incredibly patchy season, showcasing clear deficiencies with our play-style, despite Barcelona having the personnel to deploy a better style of football with more control, clarity and fluidity.
Barcelona have been very inefficient out-of-possession, and it shows in their massive increase in xGA (Expected Goals) by almost 6 (from 29.7 to 35), from last season. A more leaky defense, something that’s not anticipated from the team who was the best defensive team (on output) in La-Liga last season.
Barcelona’s press has been very lackluster against teams good on the ball. Teams like Girona and Real Madrid have been able to consistently play out of it with ease, and it goes beyond the personnel at the manager’s disposal.
Barcelona do press with a 4–4–2 structure, with often the advanced #8 and Lewandowski leading the front 2. Lewandowski, usually, aims to angle the opposition into playing out towards one flank, but the opposition can often find the free man pretty comfortably against the press, because the center is not compact, at all.
There’s a spacing issue with Barcelona — often, Barcelona find themselves so far apart from each other, that they cannot compact / constrict enough space to restrict their opponents. This is caused due to the extremely rigid man-to-man nature of the press. The players seem to be glued to one player of the opposition team irrespective of rotations / dropping deep that drives Barcelona’s key players out of position and also help teams find the free man with ease using overloads from deep.
(Source : @CaptnGuardiola from X)
This scatters the whole team — which leads to poor spacing and larger distances between each other. This level of complacency and rigidity in a team’s out of possession leads to a very exploitable approach — especially because Barcelona don’t have the highest intensity / dueling capacity, as well.
The last line of defense is also much deeper (out of cautiousness) which means the last line is looking to concede pressure / absorb pressure more than looking to close down / prevent the opposition’s by-passing to further continue until Barcelona’s box — which is one of the main causes of the uneven spacing. There’s also a clear lack of co-ordination on timing / jumps and collective movement when the press is initiated.
It seems very individualistic, with a lack of coherence and each individual with a different intent / approach to the press and that’s the sign of a lack of collective principles instilled; It’s clear that, this is more than just a personnel issue, and there’s an issue with Barcelona’s intent in covering space / the ball, that goes beyond the press.
A team’s ability to adapt to different game-states also depends upon how well-drilled and compact their blocks are. The low / mid blocks have been suboptimal from Barcelona — which, after the PSG games, many would consider a fair assertion.
Multiple games are evidence to this; the distancing between the lines has allowed too much central access to opposing teams BTL. The block tends to be too passive, allowing enough leverage around the box and solely relying on box defending, blocks and clearances.
The shifting leaves many gaps due to the larger distances between players and lack of coherence in intent. The intent in defending as an overall unit seems inherently flawed — too much of being ball-oriented and unnecessarily passive, rather than coverage of space, and compacting of space.
These are the major causes behind Barcelona’s inflation in xGA numbers and also general leakiness and lack of compactness in defense — defensive record being very poor compared to last year.
To sum it up — Barcelona have principle issues with how the football has been played, and that’s because the key enforcers on the pitch have left and we’ve been unable to put the structure to top use with coaching. Spontaneous dictators of play and solution finders like Busquets (mainly), Alba, Dani Alves and Dembele (1v1 prowess) leaving has caused a degradation in style of play due to Barcelona’s style of play, and effectiveness in style of play.
The core issue requires a manager change, unfortunately and that’s because the manager seems to be slightly inexperienced and his ideas on how to execute needs more maturation and learning — which is normal, but it also showcases that Xavi has a high potential if he can reflect on his mistakes, and what he needs to do to coach teams as a collective, better, without enforcers like Busquets.
Despite all the tactical shortcomings, Xavi has shown he is an excellent man-manager and can manage players very well by instilling a level of confidence and trust in them. He’s more than capable of pleasing a dressing room and motivating them, as a coach, and that’s an impressive quality to possess.
Barcelona have appointed Hansi Flick as the new manager, which is a slight philosophical change, but an ambitious and bold one — which only time will tell, if it pays off.
Thank you for reading; if you liked it, I would appreciate as many claps/likes, shares and comments as possible.
Much love, AM.

I recently went on what should’ve been the trip of a lifetime to Barcelona (Spain) and cities Bari, Noci, Aversa, Florence, Caserta, and Naples in Italy.
Like many trips, it was full of mishaps, twists, and surprises. But I ended up learning a lot about many things, myself included, and walked away with valuable lessons and a deeper understanding of what truly matters when exploring the world and reflecting on my own life.
And don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise.
I had initially planned to visit Rome and Pompeii in Italy, but due to time constraints, my friend and I decided to explore nearby cities instead, including Caserta. We toured the Royal Palace of Caserta before catching a train to Florence. We also ventured into lesser-known cities like Bari and Noci and had the chance to experience the vibrant Carnival of Putignano during our stay.
In Barcelona, I omitted places like the Sagrada Familia from my itinerary for several reasons: I hated crowds, was terrified of being pickpocketed, and didn’t want to go just to say I went. Additionally, since it was Ramadan for us Muslims, attending Mass at the Sagrada Familia felt sacrilegious, even if it meant gaining free admission.
Instead, I immersed myself in experiences that were more meaningful to me. I spent most of my time trying out exotic fruits I couldn’t find at home, browsing local grocery stores, learning about racial demographics and local history, talking to locals in Urdu and broken Spanish, researching the Romani people (as known as Gypsies), and studying the architectural details of everyday buildings. I have a particular fixation on doors, so I snapped as many pictures of them as I could as I roamed the city.
And I was perfectly happy doing so.
This is not to say that I didn’t do touristy things. I took a paella-making class in El Raval, where I learned how to make paella, danced around the kitchen, and had enjoyable conversations with people from Moldova, Turkey, Argentina, and the US. I tried tiramisu from every cafe I could. Afterward, I oohed and aahed at paintings in the Picasso Museum, marveled at the World Culture Museum artifacts, got lost on my way to the Chocolate Museum, and pondered the different tastes of Coca-Cola in Europe and the US at a cafe. And I shopped till I dropped, with bags full of spices, magnets, postcards, keychains, and chocolates from La Rambla.
Truthfully, I did feel guilty about “wasting” my trip. The voice in my head shamed me, telling me, “What’s the point of flying all the way here if you don’t check out Park Guell and the other tourist spots?”
But I listened to my body — my anxiety — which was screaming to be heard and decided to conserve my energy for another day of exploration. Instead of pushing my feet to walk the scenic mile home at peak traffic hour, I opted for an Uber, where I enjoyed pleasant conversation with the driver and saved my aching feet from further torment.
It’s not to say I played it completely safe.
Despite being told to avoid El Raval in Barcelona, I ventured there to check out vintage clothing boutiques, satisfy my homesick cravings for Pakistani foods, and buy custard apples. On the way, I went into a Pakistani jewelry store where I bought earrings for upcoming weddings and spoke to the kind store owner in Urdu. She was more than happy to discuss her son’s engagement drama and gave me a discount and free earrings. I wandered alone in the evenings, avoiding the dark alleys and blending in with a tourist group, and enjoyed the city lights. It was a peaceful way to enjoy the city’s vibrant lights and grew my confidence in solo travel.
They say travel broadens the mind and sheds light on the true nature of friendship. During this trip, I was lucky enough to experience both.
In Naples, I reunited with my high school bestie, who went above and beyond to ensure I had the best trip possible. She planned most of our itinerary, booked us a stay at a beautiful old apartment in Noci as a surprise for me, handled our high-speed train tickets for Florence, drove me around everywhere I needed to be, and indulged my constant whims for tiramisu. When it became clear that Italian food wasn’t meant for me, we loaded up on groceries and decided to cook paella at home, where we laughed, sang, and enjoyed one another’s company as we did so.
She also offered me the best of what she had — the master bedroom in her home, her nicest jackets, and the choice of going to Rome or Florence, Bari or Materra. She didn’t want me to pay for anything, but I insisted anyway because, despite the many problems in the way I was parented, one thing I was taught was never to take advantage of anyone’s kindness.
Our parting was more bitter than sweet. Despite doing almost nothing on my travel to-do list, the permeating odor of rotting garbage on the streets, and the death-defying traffic, I had the time (and the best tiramisu) of my life in Naples, the “trash can” of Italy, and couldn’t wait to come back and explore everything else.
Fast forward to Barcelona, where nearly every interaction with my other friend was wrought with tension, resentment, and impatience.
She nitpicked everything I did and said, walked ahead without stopping to wait for me, and made it clear that she didn’t want me around. She also claimed the nice double room in our Airbnb and had me choose between two closet-sized rooms so she could use the remaining room as her closet. I put my foot down and voiced my disapproval, where she eventually relented but gave me the silent treatment for the next couple of days. Despite my initial reluctance to explore alone, I braved my fears instead of putting up with my friend’s rudeness. To socialize, I called friends and family in the US and talked to them for hours. As miserable as I felt, I was touched that many people back home were rooting for me to have a great time in Europe.
Needless to say, this “friend” and I have parted ways, and I realized how disrespected and dismissed I felt in our friendship, as well as the many insults and snide remarks I overlooked throughout our time together.
Piggybacking on my previous point, we didn’t have the nicest lodging. It was clean, in the Sant Antoni neighborhood, surrounded by many things to do. And affordable. You do pay for what you get, especially for AirBnBs.
Our AirBnB had one double room, two single rooms, and no laundry services (despite them being advertised) or microwave. Our AirBnB hosts also failed to mention that there were no elevators in the building and that the walls were very thin. The beds in our rooms were hard and we woke up with sore, stiff backs every morning. The AC unit often turned on when it wanted to and I sweated right through my bedsheets at night.
It wasn’t an entirely bad place to be. Still, I would’ve appreciated an actual dryer machine instead of relying on the unreliable solar-powered clothes dryer on the terrace. And neighbors who were less vocal in their babymaking.
In several cities across Italy and in Barcelona, I quickly became a target for street vendors who could spot me as a tourist from a mile away. At first, I indulged them, buying a few gifts for my family back home. But the problem arose when I started being followed out of shops and booths, bombarded with pleas to “buy this” and “buy that,” often accompanied by sob stories about being an immigrant in a foreign country with large families to feed.
I get it — trust me, I do. As a former people-pleaser, I understand the urge to help. Most people-pleasers are empaths who want to save the world and make life better for the less fortunate.
But let’s be clear: traveling isn’t the way to fix everything wrong with the world. Europe is full of scammers and hustlers who won’t hesitate to overcharge you for something you could easily buy for a couple of euros at the local bodega. Learn to recognize the red flags. If someone is overly pushy or offers you something “for free” on the street, respond firmly with a resounding “NO!” Don’t worry about being rude — nice people make easy targets.
If you do want to tap into your empathetic side, try supporting local small businesses rather than money-laundering souvenir shops or tourist traps. Take the time to learn about the culture around you, try exotic fruits and vegetables, and always assert your boundaries.
Travel is one of those rare situations where I genuinely appreciate my resting bitch face. If you’re a soft-spoken people-pleaser like I used to be, one of my best tips is to put on a serious resting bitch face. It may be hard if you weren’t born with one, but trust me — this facial expression helped me ward off scammers, pickpockets, and hustlers. It also made saying “no” a whole lot easier. People tend to leave you alone when they think you look like someone who won’t tolerate their bullshit.
If mastering a resting bitch face feels impossible, at least look like you know where you’re going. Project confidence. Don’t act shifty; whatever youdo, don’t pull out your GPS in the middle of a sketchy area. If you need to check your phone, step into a store and ask the shopkeeper for directions.
If you’re from a country where seasoning is a way of life, like I am, you might find most European food a bit lackluster. Your best bet is to seek out Latin American or Asian restaurants or bring your spices as you explore.
I’m a huge fan of what Americans consider Italian food. When I was in Italy, I expected the food to be mind-blowing. Instead, I was met with disappointment. I found the dishes surprisingly underseasoned, missing the bold flavors I was used to in the US. For example, the pizzas I ate felt like they were missing key ingredients — salt, dried red chili pepper, and garlic powder. The carbonara at the cute local diner was far from the creamy indulgence I knew and loved in the States. Even the curry chicken pasta tasted like it was seasoned with nothing more than a Maggi instant noodle packet. For a foodie like me, it was almost heartbreaking.
Barcelona had a much better food scene, but by then, the damage was already done.
Despite the confusion, panic, and disappointment I encountered during my trip, I still had an unforgettable time. If anything, I’d happily redo my Barcelona trip knowing what I know now. Along the way, I’ve learned to embrace spontaneity, find joy in the unexpected, and trust in the good people I know. I also learned not to question the blessings that come my way — like the $150 I saved in baggage fees thanks to the kindness of airport staff in Europe. My ability to appreciate life’s simple pleasures — like admiring doors, staircases, and the frames surrounding iconic artworks — turned out to be the perfect way to ground myself amid the chaos.

In May, my wife and I embarked on a long-awaited trip to the captivating city of Barcelona. Leaving behind the lackluster Stansted Airport, the excellent Barcelona Airport greeted us, setting the tone for an unforgettable cultural trip. This blog post isn’t a list of things to see as many travel articles are but our feelings and responses to the vibrant atmosphere and rich cultural tapestry that is Barcelona.
We had booked a city center hotel. As we arrived late, we caught a taxi to our hotel. We engaged the driver in conversation as we often do in our travels. He responded warmly to our questions, although a little reluctantly at first because he felt his English wasn’t good enough. It was good enough for us, so we persisted. He wasn’t a Barcelonian, he came from southern Spain, but had made his home here. That’s got to mean something.
Once the driver was comfortable with us he peppered our journey with stories and things to see as we progressed into the city, such as the university, the bull ring that they had converted into a shopping mall, La Rambla, the Plaça Catalunya, and Gaudí’s Casa Batlló. Finally, we got to our hotel which was just off the impressive Passeig de Gràcia with its grand shops. (Note: Passeig is a Catalan word, not Spanish, it means Passage or avenue.) His parting words to us was to eat in the nearby street, it is very famous he said in his broken English, although better than my non-existent Spanish or Catalan.
Our driver was right. After a warm welcome at the hotel we walked right round the corner into Rambla de Catalunya, a street lined with restaurants and bars, and down the tree lined center with “alfresco” seating and tables for the restaurants. These areas were buzzing with people, chatting and laughing while they enjoyed their meal, or just drinks.
No exploration of Barcelona would be complete without indulging in its culinary treasures. We ate in the hotel most mornings and a couple of nights. However, mostly we ate in the restaurants of Rambla de Catalunya, sampling the delicious tapas, paella, and sangria that the city is renowned for. During the days we roamed around Barcelona and embarked on a culinary adventure, stepping away from the touristy hotspots. We discovered hidden gems in the lesser-known neighborhoods, going through medieval alleyways where we savored authentic Catalan dishes bursting with local flavors or the authentic Indian restaurant recommended by the hotel staff. The blend of traditional, contemporary and exotic cuisine in Barcelona is a testament to the city’s gastronomic prowess.
Upon stepping foot in Barcelona, we immediately noticed the city’s lively atmosphere, the bustling streets, filled with locals and tourists alike, brimmed with an energy that was infectious. Wandering through the enchanting Gothic Quarter, we found ourselves captivated by the charming narrow alleyways and hidden squares. We found the medieval cathedral, the roman temple of Augustus, the medieval palace, the Basilica de la Mare (for those that saw the TV series), and George Orwell square. Reminding me of Orwell’s contribution to the Spanish Civil War and his memoir’s an homage to Catalonia. With each corner turned, we stumbled upon some new scene, curiosity or event, all adding to the unique rhythm of the city. We wandered into a pharmacy on the second day and talked to the owner for about an hour. He sold many herbal remedies including dope. We bought nothing but had an enchanting time. His family had been in the same shop for over 120 years.
To truly understand the soul of Barcelona, we immersed ourselves in its rich cultural traditions. Barcelona’s passion for art was clear in every corner, with its many galleries and street art scene providing a canvas for artistic expression. I was sad that I could not attend the Flamenco festival, which was held in March, but our hotel had recommended a venue on La Rambla with Flamenco performances, I wrote about this a week or two ago. We had an excellent night.
Barcelona is the heart of Catalonia, a region with a distinct culture and language. Engaging with the locals allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the Catalonian identity. Conversations in small cafes and bars revealed the pride they held for their heritage and their ongoing pursuit of autonomy. Visiting the stunning architectural wonders of Antoni Gaudí, such as the iconic Sagrada Família and Park Güell, further reinforced the unique blend of art, history, and cultural identity that defines Barcelona, but funnily we were not driven to go into any of these. We found that just wandering the streets and exploring were a joy.
Barcelona’s prime location on the Mediterranean coast provides a perfect balance between vibrant city life and relaxing beach escapes. We soaked up the Mediterranean spirit by strolling along the picturesque seaside promenade, taking in the salty sea breeze and basking in the warm sun.
Our trip to Barcelona proved to be an enriching experience beyond our expectations. We did not see all the usual tourist attractions; but the city’s vibrant atmosphere, rich cultural traditions, and the friendliness and unwavering pride of its people captivated us. Barcelona left an indelible mark on our hearts. To describe Barcelona in a single word I would say color. But it has so much more, it’s filled with love and friendships. History is remembered, and the future embraced. The final take away: A week just wasn’t enough, you get a flavor of Barcelona but to do it justice you need much longer to savor Barcelona.

How I Met Your Mother was one of my favourite shows growing up. Watching endless reruns became such a ritual that I could effortlessly complete the dialogues. In the show, New York becomes more than just a setting — it’s a character itself. Ted Mosby, the passionate architect lead, faces a tough decision to relocate to Chicago for his career. The struggle is real as he’s deeply attached to the city. But when he decides to do so, he goes to the Empire State Building and shares his feelings on how he “hates the thought of leaving Empy”.
When I watched this as a 14 year old, I delve deep into architecture as a concept and discover why Chicago and New York are renowned for their distinctive and influential architecture.
To bid farewell to 2023, I embarked on a trip to Europe, and Barcelona emerged as one of my final destinations. When Barcelona comes to mind, I think of a vivid mix of FC Barcelona, the iconic Camp Nou, Flamenco, the tapas and the beaches. Once I got to Barcelona, it hit me that the standout feature was the incredible architecture. And at the heart of it all was the work of the Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudí.
Antoni Gaudí is known for a variety of architectural creations, ranging from parks to basilicas. The first of his marvels that I explored was La Sagrada Familia, an unfinished basilica that began construction in 1882. It’s a UNESCO world heritage site despite still being a work in progress.
The first thing that struck me about this place was that there was not a single square feet left blank on the walls of the church. At this point in my Europe journey, I had seen a ton of churches that imbibe Gothic features, but this felt incredibly rich in character and detail. I could not immediately point out what it was, but thoroughly enjoyed exploring this spectacular place on a sunny Barcelona day.
The next day, I headed to Park Güell, a cool hilltop park. It’s a UNESCO world heritage site as well, and you don’t need a detective to figure out Gaudí was behind it. Something about his style stood out again — those mosaic walls and uniquely detailed, uneven shapes. Though these are part of his signature, I sensed I was still overlooking a crucial aspect.
Next on my agenda was a visit to two of his famous buildings on the same street — Casa Batlló and Casa Milà. As I saw a sea of people outside these buildings, I realised how Gaudi is deeply engrained into Catalan culture. These 2 buildings gave away the last and the most important trait that I was missing out on. A signature Antoni Gaudi building is not just extremely well detailed with figurines and mosaic tiles, but the beauty is that none of them have straight lines or sharp corners!
The more you inspect, the more unbelievable it is that he pulled it off. Buildings with no sharp corners or straight lines, be it on the corner of a street or one of the world’s largest churches, those classic (scaleable!) Gaudí traits just ooze out. I dug up the internet to know more about why he did what he did, and found out that Gaudi often said:
I do not want to create straight lines and sharp corners because they do not exist in nature. Nature is all curves, organic shapes, and flowing lines. My architecture is a reflection of the natural world, an attempt to capture its beauty and harmony.
While I had a great time visiting Barcelona, the only 2 things that will make me want to go back are: To watch an FC Barcelona game in Camp Nou, and to revisit the Sagrada Familia once it’s complete, which is estimated to be sometime in 2030. Until then, I can only wonder what he must’ve been sketching on his notepad here.
Happy new year, and thank you for reading!

For decades, FC Barcelona was not just a football club — it was a dynasty. With all-time legends Ronaldinho, Xavi, Iniesta, and Lionel Messi, they didn’t win; they defined an era. From the tiki-taka revolution under Pep Guardiola to countless Champions League titles, Barcelona was the gold standard of European football.
But in recent years, the club collapsed miserably. Financial crisis, shoddy signings, managerial instability, and the excruciating departure of Lionel Messi in 2021 put the club back on a downward slope. Would Barcelona ever recapture their glory days? Or had they for good lost ground to European giants Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich?
Now, 2025, and the club is rebuilding again. With the exciting new set of stars including Lamine Yamal, Pedri, and Gavi, Barcelona is revealing again the flash of its great past. Is it enough, though, to regain European dominance? Let us examine where Barcelona went astray — and why they might just be turning it around again.
At the height of their success, Barcelona’s supremacy was unconquerable. Under Guardiola, they showed a lovely but efficient brand of football. Ever since their 2015…

I moved to Barcelona in September 2020, during the height of the pandemic. Although the world frowned upon travel at this time and many countries had locked down their borders, I quietly snuck in through Spain’s backdoor and never left. After flying from New York City to Dublin, Dublin to London, and then taking the Eurostar train to Paris and then two other trains to Barcelona, I entered the capital of Catalonia wild-eyed and travel-weary.
It’s been my home ever since.
I left New York with a suitcase, a carry-on, no job, and very little in my bank account. Somehow, I made things work. It was here that I wrote two books: the first about my travels in a faraway and forgotten region in Southern Siberia and the second about my years of living in New York City. Despite working in the printing industry most of my life, I stumbled into a career as a freelance content writer after my first year as a resident of Barcelona.
Looking back on how I saw things when I first moved here, my thoughts about the city have changed. Not drastically, but I no longer see Barcelona through the naive eyes of a guiri, Spain’s equivalent of “gringo.” Contrary to most who took the plunge, I refuse to refer to myself as an ex-pat. Ex-pats, in my…

By Chris Wildgen, McMaster Alumna, travel writer, photographer and tour leader.
People often ask me whether they should go to Madrid or Barcelona. Both are fantastic cities and well worth visiting. With friends in both cities, it is very hard for me to choose.
While both offer museums, sports, nature, great food and wine, history and culture, each has its own personality, and there is definitely a strong rivalry — just ask soccer/football fans!
Barcelona was my first time in Spain when I did a home exchange that planted me in the heart of the tourist area near the Picasso Museum. Though it was January, it was busy and bustling. With almost everything within a thirty-minute walk, it was a great, central location.
Two main things differentiate Barcelona from Madrid. One is its location on the Mediterranean Sea. As a beach lover, I enjoyed visiting its smaller artist-dedicated museums (such as Picasso, Dali, or Miro) in the morning, followed by a lunch of fresh fish at a chiringuito on the beach. After lunch, the cement lounge chairs on the beach are an inviting place to have a siesta while enjoying the modern architecture along the seafront.
The second thing is the architecture of Antoni Gaudí, “God’s architect”, who is currently being considered for sainthood. A visit to la Sagrada Famiglia may convince anyone that it is well-deserved. A day can be spent just visiting this and his other buildings, with an afternoon spent in Parc Guell (advisable to pre-purchase tickets.) That Barcelona embraced Gaudí and his Catalan modernism reflects the spirit of the city.
Evening entertainment can include free concerts such as a free organ concert at the Cathedral or an event at the beautiful and fanciful Palau de la Música Catalana, where I attended a memorable performance by The Barcelona Guitar Trio and Dance.
From Barcelona, possible day trips in its region of Catalonia (Catalunya) are to Montserrat 11th century Catholic monastery, Dalí Museum in Figueres or Girona, Sitges, Girona and the Costa Brava.
Everything about Madrid reminds me that it is the capital of Spain. With its sophisticated yet confidently relaxed, big-city vibe, Madrid feels like a real city, not a tourist city. Full of wide boulevards and monumental buildings, it is both grand and accessible. From my hotel away from the city centre, I walked down the wide boulevard of Paseo de la Castellana, past monumental buildings such as the Bank of Spain, eventually turning on Gran Via to go towards the center.
Instead of turning on Gran Via, continuing on I arrived at Paseo del Prado and 3 world-famous museums –the Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Prado and the Reina-Sofia. Just a block away is one of my favourite city parks, the very large Parc Retiro. From early morning until late evening, people walk or run along the many intersecting paths, use the outdoor exercise area, visit the latest exhibition at the Crystal Palace, ride small boats in the mini lake in its center, or chat with friends while enjoying coffee at a café.
From there a 30-minute walk to the Royal Palace of Madrid goes through the geographical center of Spain (and the tourist center of Madrid) of Puerto Sol, which is full of restaurants, bars and shops.
For sports lovers (especially Real Madrid fans), the Real Madrid Museum and football (soccer) pitch are memorable, but it is even better to attend a game, especially if it is against Barcelona to experience the very strong rivalry between the capital of Catalonia and the capital of Spain.
Restaurants represent all regions from Spain, with fresh seafood from Galicia and the Mediterranean and wine from the entire country, though Rioja wines seem to be favoured.
There are also easy day trips from Madrid to El Escorial, Segovia with its Roman aqueduct, Avila with its 11th century city walls, the cathedral in Toledo. For more royal experience, a 40-minute train goes to the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. Even a visit to the Mediterranean is possible with a 2-hour high speed train that takes you from Atocha station to Valencia.
So, do you choose Madrid with its capital city vibe, royal palace, history, geographic accessibility, excellent restaurants from tapa bars to fine dining, world famous museums such as the Prado and the Thyssen, small museums such as the Sorollo?
Or do you choose Barcelona with its waterfront and beach, Catalonian language, history, food and pride, and the humility and magnificence of Gaudi?
Confident and sophisticated Madrid or fun and fanciful Barcelona? With just a train ride separating them, choose both!

before things get weird, and you wonder why I never mention this world-class city.
I have lived just outside the magestical metropolis of Barcelona for almost six years. I've dragged my husband to see most of the important works of art and architecture and taken my little art-enthusiast son on adventures to museums and shops, cafes, and kids' activities. It's a wonderful city filled with inspiration and mystery, bohemia and affluence.
As well my little family and I have traveled all around the Barcelona region, from days by the Mediterranean sea to skiing in the Pyrenees. Delightful vegan cafes to classy restos which promise vegan or vegetarian options. I've posted photos and maybe some videos on Instagram but never written a proper blog post.
A vegan meat and potatoes post about all my insights and perspectives, notions, and musings of my adopted home. I don't know why that is. To be honest, I could probably JUST write about the Barcelona region for the rest of my blogging days and do quite well. But for some reason, I don't.
I guess that happens. When you live in a world-class city, you eventually take it for granted.
So, it's 2023, and I'm going to start the year off right with a quick and snappy post about Barcelona…here goes.
Barcelona is a wonderful place to visit any time of year. Although, if you are more of an art, shopping, and dining tourist, I highly recommend the winter months. Nice weather without sweltering heat and smaller lineups to all of the beautiful sites to see.
Architect Antoni Gaudí's life work really is unlike anything you will ever see anywhere else. Park Güell, Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, and La Pedrera-Casa Milà are just some of the many whimsical buildings that this true patriot of Catalonia created. I say true patriot as Gaudí was a fierce supporter and defender of Catalan culture and language no matter how much trouble it caused him.
Barcelona is for everyone. Although Friday and Saturday nights can be a party, it is a great city for most kinds of travelers. Live large in luxury or stay at a backpackers. This city is a buzzing hotspot of activities for all ages. And if you have kids and stay for an extended amount of time, you will delight in all the activities and classes they have for little ones. I can't think of a better place to raise a small child, with all the festivals and parades, gargoyles, and dragons.
Barcelona is so multilingual. Of course, you will hear Catalan and Spanish the most, but on a busy day in the city center, you will hear almost as much French, Italian, German, you name it.
Barcelona has an amazing airport. Easy to get to from the city center- Plaça de Catalunya — Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport is a hub connecting you to pretty much anywhere you want to go…or at least to another airport that will take you anywhere you want to go, like Frankfurt, Paris, etc.
Sometimes, I yearn for the south more than my Andalusian husband ever has. I plead with him that we need to move to Seville and start our lives anew, leave all this chaos behind, and set our sights on one of the world's most important historical cities…but then he reminds me of the airport, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean sea and I calm down for a while.
So, in a nutshell, I truly adore my new home. I feel honored and amazed that I get to live here. I'm so Canadian and monolingual that I sometimes giggle nervously in shock as I hear my small son chattering on in Spanish or translate Catalan into English for my benefit.
I'm forever grateful for that trip I took in 2015 to Barcelona that made me want to come back and stay just long enough to feel what it would be like to live here. And on my second trip in 2016, I met a man from Seville who lived in Barcelona and would one day become mi marido.
So if I never mention Barcelona again, know it's because I'm busy thinking about other things, not because I'm not smitten.

Commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.
Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto “Més que un club” (“More than a club”).[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world’s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the “Cant del Barça”, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

This season began with a mix of emotions for FC Barcelona fans when the club decided to part ways with Xavi Hernández as head coach. For many, it was a shocking and divisive decision. Xavi had delivered a decent campaign last season, including winning La Liga in his first full season. He also introduced promising talents like Lamine Yamal and Cubarsi to the first team, showing his ability to develop young players.
Read to the end HERE
However, others, including myself to some extent, believed the move was a step in the right direction for the club. While Xavi’s impact on rebuilding the team was evident, his ability to guide Barcelona back to being genuine contenders for Europe’s top honours was unclear. The “New Era” Barcelona needed a coach with elite-level experience and tactical mastery to compete with Europe’s finest, and this is where Hansi Flick comes in.
When the club appointed Flick, fans welcomed the decision with great optimism and hope. His track record, particularly his remarkable feat with Bayern Munich, where he famously dismantled Barcelona 8-2 in the Champions League, spoke volumes about his capabilities. He is known as a disciplined, tactical coach who prioritizes structure and confidence, traits that were desperately needed to stabilize Barcelona.

A data-driven strategy to rebuild Barcelona’s core and prepare them for the 2024/25 season.
Barcelona has faced tough times since Covid, especially after losing their biggest star, Lionel Messi. The club has made several big signings since then, but not all have been successful. As a data scientist, I want to imagine a strategy meeting with Deco, Laporta, and Flick to help rebuild Barcelona. Using my Moneyball approach, we’ll explore affordable solutions to strengthen the team where it needs it most.
To tackle Barcelona’s issues, I studied Hansi Flick’s Bayern 2021, a manager and a team I admire. I analyzed key players from that era to find current, affordable alternatives. For example, I used Lewandowski’s 2021 stats to identify a low-cost striker, as Lewy isn’t getting any younger. I also explored Müller’s 2021 profile after Barcelona signed Olmo as a number 10 and Kimmich’s 2021 profile out of curiosity. Beyond Bayern’s comparisons, I felt Barcelona needed a pacey left winger and a creative right back, leading me to analyze Nico Williams and Cancelo from the 2023–24 season.
Finally, I’ll share my ideal lineup and the reasoning behind each choice. Let’s dive into the data.
For Cancelo, I employed a dual approach: first, I analyzed his aggregated stats from the last four seasons to identify proven players with consistent performances. This method helps to highlight experienced players who have maintained high levels of play over several years. Second, I focused on his stats from the most recent season to uncover any potential hidden gems. This strategy is particularly useful for spotting emerging talents who had standout performances last season and could offer great value as rising stars.
Barcelona’s tradition of dynamic full-backs demands a solid replacement for Cancelo. Last year’s signing was reminiscent of Barcelona’s golden days, but with no clear pursuit of Cancelo now, I explored low-cost alternatives.
Di Lorenzo and Hamari Traoré emerged as top options. Traoré, in particular, shows promise as a strong, reliable choice.
Despite a dip, Cancelo’s playmaking remained elite.
Among new talents, Tiago Santos stood out. He’s quick, skillful, and has the potential to grow into a superstar, though he can be caught defensively at times.
For his age, Tiago Santos shows great potential. Barcelona could lock down the right-back position, a position that since Dani Alves left never looked the same, for years with him. While he occasionally struggles defensively, especially in aerial duels, with the right development and environment, he has the makings of a future superstar. Portugal’s depth at right-back is impressive, and Santos could be the next big name.
Tiago Santos. His blend of youth, skill, and potential makes him the right choice to secure Barcelona’s right-back position for the future.
Nico Williams is a top-class winger — exactly the type of player who is direct, exciting, and can create something out of nothing. There were strong links to Barcelona, but it seems he’s staying at Athletic Club, where he’s been honored with the iconic number 10 shirt. With that in mind, I explored low-cost alternatives through a Moneyball approach using his 2023–24 La Liga stats.
Sávio was another strong candidate, but he’s already settled at Manchester City. After eliminating left-footed wingers and those recently transferred, Chris Führich from VfB Stuttgart became the standout choice. Führich shares many qualities with Williams: he’s quick, direct, and has a knack for creating opportunities in tight situations. His playstyle could make him an effective and low-cost option for Barcelona.
Although it may not have the same allure as a big-name signing, this is about finding under-the-radar talents that fit the needs. In fact, Führich could also be a great addition to a team like Arsenal, known for their creative and dynamic wingers.
So, while it may not be the headline-grabbing signing fans might hope for, going for Chris Führich would be a smart and pragmatic decision for Barcelona.
Lewandowski’s 2020–21 season was his peak — a complete striker at the top of his game. Although he’s still delivering for Barcelona, it’s time to plan for the future. Using his 2020–21 stats as a benchmark, I analyzed current players to find a similar profile.
Top names like Haaland and Kane naturally showed up, but they’re either unattainable or don’t fit Barca’s needs. Jonathan David, however, stood out as the ideal low-key option. With one year left on his contract, he’s an affordable, long-term solution who can grow into the role.
Based on the data, Barcelona should strongly consider Jonathan David as Lewandowski’s heir.
In the 2020–21 Bayern squad, Müller and Kimmich caught my eye for their extraordinary performances, so I decided to explore how Barcelona could benefit from similar players.
Müller is often underrated, but in 2020–21, he was truly world-class. Using our Moneyball approach, we explored potential alternatives to Müller, identifying players who exhibit similar qualities.
And who do we see among the top alternatives? None other than Dani Olmo — a player who might just be the key to Barcelona’s future under Flick. It’s intriguing to see Olmo here, and it feels like a promising sign for what’s to come.
Also, a special mention to one of my favorite playmakers in Europe, Lorenzo Pellegrini, whose inclusion here highlights his underrated brilliance. These insights could be vital in shaping a creative and effective midfield for Barcelona.
It feels like more than just a coincidence that Olmo appears among the top alternatives. His presence here might be a significant indicator of how well he could fit into Flick’s system at Barcelona. Let’s wait and see how Olmo performs under Flick’s guidance — there’s a lot of potential for something special to develop.
When news broke that Tuchel didn’t see Kimmich as a central midfielder last season, it sent shockwaves through the football world. To me, it was baffling, given how Kimmich was one of the best in that position during the 2020–21 season. A move to Barcelona seems like a perfect fit, though it would be costly this summer. Perhaps next year, with his contract nearing its end, it might be more feasible.
Here’s what I found when comparing his 2020–21 stats with current players.
The list of top names didn’t surprise me, but one detail might have slipped by — yes, Ilkay Gündoğan from last season is in there. With news of him leaving for free, it’s a significant loss for Barcelona. It will be interesting to see how they adapt and what strategies Flick might propose to fill that gap.
With all the key positions addressed and some interesting insights uncovered along the way, it’s time to visualize how Barcelona could shape up for the 2024/25 season using the data-driven approach we’ve explored.
Let’s take a look at the proposed lineup and see how these carefully selected players can help Barcelona reach new heights under the guidance of Hansi Flick.
If Barcelona were to follow my data-driven approach, this lineup would reflect not only the numbers but also my vision of football.
I opted for Christensen because he has exceeded expectations in the deeper midfield role, especially crucial in the first leg against PSG where his absence was felt in the second leg. De Jong’s ability to carry the ball from deep is invaluable, but with Pedri and Gavi’s injury issues, especially Gavi’s serious one, it’s wise to manage their workload.
I also prefer having a left-footed center-back for optimal passing angles. The full-backs should be balanced, with one focusing on direct play and the other offering creativity. On the wings, a skillful player paired with a direct one complements an all-round forward to complete the ideal setup.
I might be stepping into Flick’s shoes, but this lineup is inspired by his best side.
This approach demonstrates how a data-driven approach can offer practical solutions for squad building, even for a club as prestigious as Barcelona.
The proposed lineup represents a balanced approach, incorporating a mix of youth, experience, and players who align with Flick’s tactical philosophy. While it might seem underwhelming compared to Real Madrid’s recent signings, these players are chosen based on their fit within the system and potential to grow into key roles.
What do you think of this lineup? Who would you suggest using your data-driven approach to strengthen the squad?

“I’m Sexy And I Know It,” the top hit from 2011 sung by LMAO blared from the car radio. My kids and I belted the lyrics while we waited for my husband, Eric, to return from the bank with dollars exchanged for Euros.
We were traveling to the airport to catch a flight to Barcelona.
Six months earlier, Eric discovered a website that listed flight prices across the globe. Barcelona had the lowest fares, so we booked our family vacation.
Part of our overseas adventure would include a football game. I knew nothing about the sport, but I did know that two teens would want more than just museum tours on their vacay.
We had no idea what an adventure going to Camp Nou Stadium would be. It was September 2011. FC Barcelona was playing Real Madrid CF.
Of course, we needed the right outfits to cheer on our new favorite team.
We dressed in our athletic best and proceeded to the stadium.
Barcelona was one of the most accessible cities we’d ever been to, but subways in many cities are notorious for being frustrating obstacles for the disabled. Our daughter is paralyzed and has…

Recommended time of stay 1.5 weeks
Overall Vibe of the place: fun, touristy, energetic, friendly
Barcelona! Wow what a perfect place to start off my solo trip, it is full of life, architecture, friendly people. It just has this fun, friendly party vibe to it with so much to see. But it also has a huge amount of tourists so be ready for lots of people walking around with camera’s, there are also a lot of pickpockets especially in the touristy areas so be sure to watch your stuff. My friend came to visit me in Barcelona and got his wallet stolen and was only there for like 4 days. It’s definitely a huge problem but you should be fine as long as you are careful.
There really is so much to see in Barcelona but here are my top places that just really stood out.
If there is one place you need to go to in Barcelona it is the Sagrada Famillia. My heart literally jumps every time I see it, the architecture is just so detailed and fantastical, I was amazed to find a new thing every time I examined the structure. With detailed carving all around, mosaic tiles, and words all around the building it is the most interesting beautiful building I’ve ever seen in my life. It kind of reminds me of a magical and very detailed sand castle.
Now to go over the inside, I would say it is worth is to see it on the outside just onlooking the building but it is even MORE worth it to go inside. I got so emotional inside I literally had to cry a little because it was just so beautiful I couldn’t believe it. With tall grand high ceilings meant to replicate trees, and rainbow colors of light reflecting through the windows it just had this sacred feeling to it. I’m pretty sure I stayed inside for at least an hour just looking around taking it all in. I honestly can’t compare it to any other place I’ve been to. It sort of has this sci-fi feeling to it like your in a futuristic spaceship or something. I love Gaudis work for his uses of curves, and combining classical architectural ideas with natural subjects and designs.
A little about the building, it was built by Antoni Gaudi and it is so detailed it is still not complete yet but is projected to be done in 2026 (I can’t wait to see it completed!) to coincide with Gaudi’s death in 1926. Gaudi’s body is also buried inside of the Sagrada Famillia which makes sense since he dedicated part of his life to working on this structure and never worried about how long it would take. I guess this really teaches you truly great things take a lot of time.
Also I recommend you purchase your tickets AT LEAST 3 days in advanced I bought mine 2 weeks in advance which you don’t need to do but they sell out very fast.
Another building designed by the great Antoni Gaudi (he really is a genius and I wish I could’ve met him). Located in the Illa de la Discòrdia and commissioned by Josep Battló who was a wealthy textile manufacturer. He gave Gaudi full creative access to do whatever he pleased and boy did he. Their are no straight edges throughout the entire building and it has this sort of under water playful aquatic feel to it. When I was climbing up the stairs I felt as if I was in a pool of some sort. Once you get to the top you have an stunning view of the city along with mosaic designs throughout the top area. I’ve never been in any place like this and I don’t think there are many building out there with these types of designs so it is a must see especially for architecture lovers.
I will admit this is a very touristy area but I can definitely see why, I love walking through the small alleys with beautiful windows and architectural designs with every step you take. Also I’m not a big person for tourist shops but these shops seemed less basic and more interesting. I bought a handmade leather bracelet as my tourist item and the women makes all of it there she even sized it in front of me to fit my tiny wrist haha. The restaurants are all fantastic in this location and be sure to buy some hot chocolate they have rich, thick hot chocolate almost everywhere you go, its basically hot pudding and it is heaven.
Right in the Gothic District is the Gothic Quarter and it is free to go in at the right times (From 8 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. to 7:30 p.m) otherwise you just need to pay a donation fee. The building took almost 2 centuries to build, yeah thats right and you can tell walking past it you can’t help but stop and stare and it to take in all the elegance of it.
This is the beach to go to just to sit and relax, its right next to the Gothic Quarter so its the perfect place to take in some sun after walking around all day. The water is really warm I even checked it out at night and it was still warm and swimmable. Theres a lot of young tourists here and it’s next to all the nightlife happening so this is the place to be.
The Picasso Museum is one of the best museums to go to for all you Picasso fans out there. It shows his evolution as an artist and how he did different things at different periods in his life. I have to say I was very pulled into his simple pencil and paper drawings since I like to draw myself it was refreshing to see some his mistakes and messy lines which really reassured me as an artist that everyone makes mistakes. It also showed me that it is completely normal to go through different design periods throughout your life. His work really took me away and brought me into his most memorable times in his life. I didn’t realize this till later but the museum is free Thursday nights from 6:30–9:00pm to try to check it out then.
Another wonderful achievement by Antoni Gaudi, originally a garden city and later commissioned by Eusebi Güell to redesign it. He continues with his playful, colorful, and smooth designs throughout the park. He wanted to keep its natural design and just build on top of that. While adding detailed mosaic tiles and keeping the natural ground stones all over the park. Not to mention the spectacular view you get of the entire city in the park, this is definitely a place you wouldn’t want to miss.
This is the club I went to to see one of my favorite bands and the show was amazing but I was blown away by the club myself. This is a place where people come for music and I can tell I even made some friends on the rooftop of the club. There is a stairwell section with red lights and the design of it just really surprised and delighted me. No one was pushy here and the drinks weren’t too much definitely a place to check out if your into live music.
Since I was in Spain I had to try out the rich thick hot chocolate that they seemed to have everywhere and hands down this place is the best. I can really tell the quality and taste is truly exquisite. I love the interior of this place also it’s really great for just working on your computer and relaxing and the staff was very friendly and polite.
Located in Catalonia, Spain this huge museum is surely a place to check out while you’re in Barcelona. They have all different types of artwork throughout history ranging from gothic artwork to renaissance showing how history has made art evolve throughout time. They also have a featured side exhibit at the museum, when I went it was Dali and Gala and how they both inspired each other with their artwork. This is a huge museum so be sure to plan staying for the full day (I would say 2–4 hours at least).
I really hope this helps you out on your next trip to Barcelona and let me know if you do go to any of these places!

Intro
As someone who wakes up early, I have come to appreciate breakfast out of the house more and more. Either as a solitary occasion to gather my thoughts, take time out, and plan for the day, or as a social event with a like-minded early riser, usually a fellow entrepreneur in my case, such as my good friend and local businessman Gunter, who is in the sex shop business, but that is a curious side note. We all know having variety in your personal and business network is wise!
So, after doing the rounds and trying several breakfast places out, a few good, some mediocre, and many terrible, I want to document my own personal top 4 in Barcelona.
If you are looking for coffee shops or patisseries, this will not be the article for you. There is an abundance of these in the city. Being an amateur athlete (I say that very loosely, as if football and gym sessions count for something) and a growing boy, I need some protein for breakfast, so to qualify for my list, the places needed to have some solid egg-based or protein dishes as menu mainstays. Also, and I must be pedantic on this, I am talking strictly about breakfast, and not what has come to be the trend in recent years — dare I say it — brunch! Please allow me to go on a tangent here before we get to my list, but I am pretty much anti-brunch and anti a lot of what brunch represents. Don’t get me wrong, the dishes are nice, but the concept of mid-morning eating of what is essentially breakfast for late risers and posers is not my cup of tea. I’m here for the good old-fashioned pre-10:00 a.m. breakfast, or 08:00 on the dot if I can get it.
So here is my list, as a local in Barcelona and in no particular order of ranking:
№1: El Corte Inglés
Plaça de Catalunya, 14, 08002 Barcelona
Classic, no-nonsense, and great price point. Open from 09:00, you can choose from either an omelette and toast or freshly made Tortilla de Patatas with toast. Located pretty centrally in Plaza Catalunya.
№2: Café de l’Architecte
Rambla de Catalunya, 76, 08008 Barcelona (attached to Hotel Condes de Barcelona)
A bar and restaurant attached to the hotel Hotel Condes which sits on the corner of Rambla Catalunya with Passatge de la Concepció. It’s a nice spot and an intimate meeting point. Open from 09:00, it would be great if it opened at 08:00, but I guess they don’t see too much demand for that. They offer a nice variation of choices and additional ingredients for your omelette or scrambled eggs. If they were to add some artisanal coffee and tea options, to their menu it would be a plus, but I will cut them some slack on this, as the establishment has an air of the traditional to it.
№3: Billy Brunch
Various locations throughout the city.
One of the best for options, variety, and choice. It’s probably better known as a brunch spot, but it opens at 09:30 for people like myself who value breakfast over brunch. I’ve been to various locations of theirs throughout the city, and I’m yet to be disappointed by the service. There is thought attached to the attention to detail of the service at Billy Brunch, which I love especially because Barcelona restaurants often struggle to offer good service, mainly because they probably don’t feel they need to make an effort with such a high footfall of tourists and transient clientele walking in. Billy Brunch however bucks that trend, and they make a fantastic Chai Latte, one of the better ones in the city actually which is always a plus for me as someone who doesn’t drink coffee.
№4: Citizen Café
Pl. d’Urquinaona, 4, L’Eixample, 08010 Barcelona
One of the few good breakfast places in Barcelona that opens from 08:00. This spot became my place for post-early-morning gym session fuelling. Located in Urquinaona and with a wide variety of menu options, this is breakfast done well and at the proper time for those of us who have busy days ahead and things to get on with. The staff have been very pleasant here in my experience. Like the other options that serve brunch, this place starts to fill up quite quickly. It’s been a few weeks since I’ve been myself, so I’m looking forward to heading back here soon.
There might be some options that are new or that I am not aware of. I typically value a central location if I am meeting people, so maybe there are local spots in Barcelona’s neighbourhoods that I should consider. By the way, if you’re local and in business like myself and fancy joining me next time for a networking breakfast, shoot me a message. Remember, breakfast not brunch! And if you are visiting this wonderful city and looking for some early-opening, good options for breakfast, then I hope you enjoy these recommendations and let me know how you get on with them in the comments.

Barça’s 2023–24 season is being far from good. They’re currently 6 points away from the leader but with one more match played — so the difference could rise to 9 points today — and the number of goals they’ve received this year in 18 games is already higher than the total goals from last season.
Not good defensively, but the offense doesn’t compensate for it.
In this post, I’ll oversimplify the causes of Barça’s situation focusing on numbers only. Of course, these only explain half the equation: the apathy or lack of motivation we’re seeing on the pitch can’t be translated into numbers… Yet.
But stats are rather the consequence of these psychological factors.
If you’re a FCB fan and have been following their last games, I might not discover anything new here. But I believe this could be a good read for those who don’t and those who want to learn how to use stats to understand the game.
Here’s a summary of Barça’s last 5 matches, ordered chronologically:

In the words of the celebrated author Paulo Coelho, “The danger of adventure is worth a thousand days of ease and comfort.” With this profound quotation in mind, I embarked on a thrilling journey to the captivating city of Barcelona. Armed with an open heart and a sense of wanderlust, I set out to explore the enchanting streets, immerse myself in the vibrant culture, and discover the untold stories that lay hidden beneath its façade. Little did I know that this adventure would lead me to encounter unexpected encounters with diverse souls from across the globe, each contributing to the kaleidoscope of experiences that shaped my time in Barcelona. Join me as I unravel the tale of my adventurous sojourn, where the allure of the unknown merged seamlessly with the promise of self-discovery. This is a chronicle of courage, resilience, and the magic that unfolds when we dare to step outside our comfort zones and embrace the uncharted path. Welcome to My Barcelona Adventure.
Making the trip
Attending an international school with the power of a Schengen passport and having a bunch of GenZ classmates, I felt the pressure to travel, explore the world, and find peace out of my comfort zone. It took me five months to gather the courage to leave Madrid. Initially, I had plans to visit a Liberian in Barcelona whom I didn’t know much about, but she had assured me of taking good care of me and showing me around the city. Our conversation started back in November 2022, and I had considered traveling in December 2022 during our most extended school break when everyone was going to their home country to see their family and loved ones. However, I had to prioritize completing my NIE process — to obtain a resident permit for my studies at IE Business School. Then, I postponed the trip to January 2023, and later to February 2023, feeling unsure and indecisive. Finally, I decided to take the plunge and booked a train within a week, thanks to the stipend from my scholarship.
I informed my Liberian “host” that I was finally coming to Barcelona. I shared my travel details and attempted to have a phone conversation, but she was primarily busy or unresponsive. Nonetheless, I didn’t ask her directly if she would be hosting me, as she had previously promised to show me around.
The scheduled trip was set for 8 pm after the end of our second term, and while everyone else seemed excited, I found myself feeling a bit bored (details that I will highlight in a subsequent blog). But despite the mixed emotions, there was an underlying sense of excitement as I was finally going to spend an amazing weekend in Barcelona. Everything was seemingly set for my adventure.
Dammit!
Just as I was about to board the train to Barcelona, I received a message from my host:
“Did you book an Airbnb?”
Oh no! I realized that I had made a mistake. I should have clarified the accommodation arrangements with her beforehand. I replied, admitting that I hadn’t booked an Airbnb, but I also didn’t explicitly mention my assumption that she would be hosting me. During the two-hour trip from Madrid to Barcelona, I frantically searched for a suitable and affordable Airbnb, but to my dismay, the prices were about 20% higher in Barcelona compared to Madrid. I couldn’t find any suitable option during the train journey, and so I arrived in Barcelona Sants, the train station, without a place to stay.
My Liberian “host” had initially assured me that she would pick me up from Barcelona Sants upon my arrival. However, as I reached out to inform her of my presence, she regretfully informed me that she couldn’t fulfill her promise. Her friend, who was supposed to provide the transportation, had become occupied with other matters. I found myself stranded at Barcelona Sants, the clock ticking closer to midnight, and the weight of the situation settling upon me.
In this unexpected situation, I had no choice but to find an available Airbnb and get myself out of the train station as soon as possible. The stress of the moment was mounting, and I knew I had to act swiftly to secure a place to stay for the night.
Fortunately, I managed to find a suitable place called Hola Hostel, which perfectly fit my criteria of being affordable and charming. The added bonus was its convenient location, just a short 3-minute walk away from Spotify Camp Nou. With a sense of relief, I made my way to the nearest metro station, ready to face the challenges of navigating Barcelona without the aid of Google Maps since my phone had switched off.
Despite the hurdles and occasional moments of uncertainty, I arrived safely at Hola Hostel. The staff was welcoming, and I arranged my accommodation for the next two nights. It felt like a small victory, given the earlier setback, and I was eager to make the most of my time in Barcelona, even without my phone’s constant guidance.
I went to bed by 2:00 AM
The Indian Couple
When I arrived at Hola Hostel, I immediately headed for a refreshing shower in one of the bathrooms. The following day, on February 25, 2023, I returned to the bathroom to brush my teeth but inadvertently left my toothpaste behind. Upon getting my toothpaste and exiting the bathroom, I bumped into a friendly lady named Divya, who was standing at the door. I could tell from her expression that she was a bit surprised to see me, as the bathroom was probably designated for females only. Realizing my mistake, I felt a bit embarrassed, but Divya was understanding and welcoming, which helped ease my discomfort.
In an attempt to make up for my awkward encounter, I struck up a conversation with Divya. Curious to know more about her, I asked where she was from. She shared that she was from India and currently studying in Austria. Learning that she was also a tourist like me, I asked about her plans for the day. I had little faith in my Liberian “host”, given the earlier miscommunication, and was looking for an enjoyable day out in Barcelona. Divya mentioned that she and her boyfriend, Kabir, were going to the stadium, specifically Camp Nou. To my surprise, she kindly invited me to join them.
Although I had initially hoped for a spontaneous adventure with a fellow solo traveler, I was still excited to explore Camp Nou with the couple. Despite my mixed emotions, I found Kabir to be friendly and welcoming as well. Our trip to the stadium turned out to be a wonderful experience, and I was grateful for the unexpected company and the opportunity to share this adventure with new friends.
After Camp Nou, what’s next?
Everyone should visit Camp Nou or a football stadium as beautiful and historic as Camp Nou at least once in their lifetime. Even though I am not a Barcelona fan, my visit to Camp Nou brought me closer to the team, enriched me with its history, and made me appreciate the beauty of football even more. We embarked on a comprehensive 360 tour of the stadium, and in my enthusiasm, I found myself lagging behind a couple of times, giving them some privacy for romantic moments, and bombarding them with numerous questions. Divya and Kabir, while initially patient, seemed to become a bit exasperated with my curiosity.
At the end of the tour, they mentioned that they were planning to find an Indian restaurant to have lunch. However, when I asked to join them, they hesitated and said they would be meeting some friends, leaving me to figure out my next move. It was already 1:00 pm, and I hadn’t received any communication from my Liberian “host” yet. The uncertainty of my situation started to weigh on me as I contemplated what to do next in this unfamiliar city.
After the somewhat awkward situation at Spotify Camp Nou, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I spotted a McDonald’s nearby and saw it as an opportunity to charge my phone and grab some lunch. It was a relieving break, allowing me to regroup and plan my next steps.
Around 2:00 PM, I finally received a response from my Liberian “host”. She once again apologized for not being able to pick me up from the Hostel as promised, explaining that her friend was occupied. While I appreciated her honesty, I couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed by the turn of events. Nevertheless, we had a brief chat, and she recommended some places for me to explore in Barcelona.
Equipped with her suggestions and a charged phone, I set out to make the most of the remainder of the day. I embraced the idea of navigating the city on my own, using the newfound freedom to delve into the sights and sounds of Barcelona, appreciating every moment of this unplanned adventure.
With a sense of excitement and curiosity, I made up my mind to visit the renowned Sagrada Familia, the largest unfinished Roman Catholic church in the world. I navigated my way to the nearest metro station, and to my delight, I encountered a kind-hearted Colombian individual who communicated with me through sign language. Sergio’s warm demeanor and willingness to assist me made me feel at ease.
With Sergoi’s help, I confirmed that I was headed in the right direction to reach Sagrada Familia. He even suggested a sightseeing tour of the exterior of the magnificent building, which seemed like a wonderful idea to me. Instead of paying 50 euros to see the interior, I opted for the chance to marvel at the breathtaking architecture from the outside.
Throughout the journey on the metro, Sergio continued to wear a beautiful smile, making me feel grateful for their company and guidance. He reminded me to be careful and watchful during our ride together, emphasizing the importance of safety.
I arrived at my destination and bid Sergio farewell as he was stopping at the next metro and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude for this serendipitous encounter. I embarked on my sightseeing adventure, eager to explore the awe-inspiring beauty of Sagrada Familia, while cherishing the memory of the unexpected friendship formed through a shared moment of communication.
Oh my gosh!
Sagrada Familia is indeed a breathtaking marvel. This awe-inspiring cathedral, designed by the visionary architect Antoni Gaudí, commenced its construction in 1882. Gaudí’s artistic genius and innovative architectural concepts have left an indelible mark on the world, making Sagrada Familia a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate hearts and minds.
Standing outside Sagrada Familia felt like stepping into a diverse paradise. Conversations in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese intermingled, creating a vibrant tapestry of languages and cultures. The scene was nothing short of beautiful, with a lively and diverse crowd filling the air with excitement and energy. Among the approximately 200 people surrounding me, all on their own purported pilgrimage to this grand cathedral, I stood as a solo traveler, somewhat frustrated with my Liberian “host”, yet elated to be present at Sagrada Familia in that very moment.
At the cathedral’s entrance, a multitude of tourists buzzed with activity, some trying to enter, while others were exiting. The atmosphere was warm and electric, as people chatted, danced, sang, and savored their meals. The ambiance was alive with a festive spirit.
I took my time exploring the surroundings, capturing precious moments through photographs, walking amidst the crowd, and savoring the melodic tunes of Spanish guitarists. However, after about an hour and thirty minutes, I craved a different experience. The time neared 5:00 PM, and still, there had been no word from my Liberian “host”.
Abdelali and how we found each other
Just as I was about to check my phone and prepare to leave the grounds of Sagrada Familia, a gentle touch on my back startled me. Hoping to find a fellow solo traveler, perhaps an English-speaking lady, eager to explore like myself, I turned around, only to meet the gaze of a fair-skinned young man with a shy expression. He stood at an average height, and with a friendly smile, he made a simple request, “Can you take my picture?”
Intrigued, I gladly obliged and inquired about his name. He introduced himself as Abdelali, a Moroccan student studying in France, who had come to Barcelona for a vacation. Abdelali, as it turned out, was quite the seasoned traveler himself. Having lived in Ukraine and explored various destinations within the Schengen area, he had accumulated a wealth of experiences and stories.
Our conversation flowed effortlessly as I expressed my eagerness for the next adventure and sought his recommendations. “Can we go to the beach?” I asked him. Graciously, Abdelali agreed to accompany me on this new escapade, explaining that he also had a booking issue to resolve with an Airbnb on the nearby beach.
With a newfound travel companion by my side, I felt a renewed sense of excitement and anticipation. Barcelona’s beach beckoned, and with Abdelali as my guide, I knew this impromptu journey would be filled with unforgettable moments and the shared joy of exploration. Together, we embarked on our beach adventure, ready to embrace the unknown and cherish the bond formed through the serendipity of travel.
Within about 30 minutes, Abdelali and I managed to find the nearest metro station, and with ease, we hopped on a bus that swiftly transported us to Barceloneta, the most renowned and beloved beach in Barcelona. As my eyes beheld the splendor of the beach, the swaying palm trees, and the vast expanse of the ocean, my soul felt an immediate revival. The stress and worries of the day seemed to dissipate, replaced by a profound sense of relief, and I prepared to immerse myself in the wonders of nature.
It had been a long five months since I last set eyes on a beach, and Barceloneta turned out to be the most stunning one I had ever encountered. The beach exuded a lively and vibrant atmosphere, adorned with the rhythmic sounds of Spanish music and the delightful aroma of typical Spanish cuisine that enveloped the air. The sun radiated warmth, casting its golden rays upon everything in its path, bringing joy to every heart and a smile to every face.
As I strolled along the shoreline, my spirit lifted with every turn and every glance at the people around me. The beach was a lively tapestry of young and old people engaged in joyful activities such as singing, dancing, riding bicycles, or simply relishing delightful conversations with their friends. After assisting Abdelali in resolving his Airbnb issue, I couldn’t resist the allure of the ocean any longer. With a hunger to inhale its salty breeze and bask in its refreshing embrace, I rushed towards the waves, ready to surrender myself to the soothing rhythm of the sea.
At that moment, under the azure sky, surrounded by laughter, music, and shimmering waters, I felt a profound sense of gratitude. Barcelona had unexpectedly gifted me a beautiful beach experience, and with Abdelali by my side, the day unfolded as a serendipitous tale of camaraderie and delight. The wonders of nature had worked their magic, and I couldn’t help but sigh in relief, cherishing the blissful escapade that was Barceloneta.
Abdelali and I continued our exploration of Barcelona, hopping on a bus that traversed the city’s vibrant streets. Our journey led us to two more captivating destinations — the Arena de Barcelona and the Barcelona Magic Fountain. At each location, I couldn’t help but marvel at the exuberant merrymaking, the infectious music, and the palpable joy of adventure that surrounded us.
Throughout our day together, Abdelali and I forged a deep bond, sharing laughter, stories, and a genuine sense of camaraderie. As the clock neared 8 pm, we found ourselves at the mesmerizing Barcelona Magic Fountain. The atmosphere was nothing short of enchanting, with the grand building overlooking the fountain, creating a mountain-like backdrop that added to the fountain’s allure. The music that resonated through the air had a captivating effect on Abdelali, making him hesitant to leave the scene.
However, despite the temptation to stay longer, I needed to see my Liberian “host” who had been elusive throughout the day. We made a compromise; I assured Abdelali that I would find her and catch up afterward. He understood my situation, and with a sense of excitement, we made plans to explore Barcelona’s vibrant nightlife, heading to clubs and reveling in the city’s after-dark magic.
Our shared adventure had been a rollercoaster of emotions, from the initial frustration with my “host” to the serendipitous encounter with Abdelali that led to a day filled with joy and discovery. As we set off on our respective paths for the moment, I knew that this chance encounter had added a touch of magic to my Barcelona adventure. With the promise of an exhilarating night ahead, I felt a renewed sense of anticipation, eager to embrace whatever the night had in store for us.
Dammit!
I must admit, I found myself in quite a predicament. As I bid farewell to Abdelali, my phone battery was barely holding on at a mere 1%. I felt a tinge of embarrassment, knowing that I had my charger with me but no power bank to rely on. The truth was, I had underestimated how terrible my iPhone 8’s battery life had become, simply because I spent most of my time either at school or home, where a stable electricity supply was always at hand.
Despite the low battery, I couldn’t shake the urge to meet my elusive Liberian “host.” There was an inexplicable determination within me, perhaps fueled by the need to confirm her existence or to consider this trip a resounding success. Regardless of the reason, I knew I had to see her. There was no room for giving up now.
With the address she sent me, I asked Abdelali to help me navigate using Google Maps. Together, we discovered the nearest metro station and embarked on the journey. The destination seemed distant, approximately 45 minutes away, spanning 11 metro stations, and requiring two train changes.
As I reached the final metro station, I finally managed to charge my phone and mustered the courage to call my Liberian “host.” A deep breath of relief escaped me as I spoke to her in our familiar Liberian parlance, “I am here oo, come for me na.” There was a mix of emotions swirling within me, ranging from anticipation to trepidation, as I eagerly awaited her arrival. This moment would mark the culmination of a day filled with unexpected twists and turns, making it all the more meaningful
But apparently, I had gone to a different province. The address Abdelali put on the map was the name of the address as my Liberian “ host”, but it was in the wrong province. She lived out of central Barcelona and when I checked Google Maps, it was about 1 hour by metro and 30 minutes by taxi at the cost of 35 euros. Should I visit my Liberian “host” by 11:00 PM? If yes, how?
Stuck on the train with a Chinese lady at midnight
After an intense period of brainstorming and careful consideration, lasting about 30 minutes, I finally reached a decision. I opted to take the metro, convinced that it would offer a relatively seamless journey, granted I exercised a fair amount of patience. Thus, I embarked on the one-hour metro trip to reach my elusive Liberian “host.”
As the journey commenced, I was filled with a mix of anticipation and determination. The initial phase consisted of the first two metro stops, followed by a train transfer to reach Cardanyola del Valles in the Ripollet province of Barcelona. Navigating my way to the train station posed quite the challenge, compounded by my phone’s meager 20% battery life and the time being around 11:45 PM. The streets were dimly lit, and the cold night air only added to the intensity of the situation.
Undeterred, I forged ahead, maneuvering through the darkness with a blend of courage and concern. The gravity of my determination to meet my Liberian “host” kept me going, outweighing the difficulties I faced. At this point, the journey had transformed into a personal mission — a testament to my refusal to surrender and my unwavering commitment to finally meet the person I had been seeking throughout the day.
I boarded the train to Cardanyola del Valles with a sense of immense relief. At long last, I had reached the final leg of my journey, even though I still had to walk approximately 12 minutes from the train station to my Liberian “host’s” residence. I repeatedly checked my phone, ensuring that I was on the correct train and that the timing was right. Everything seemed to be proceeding as planned until an unexpected turn of events occurred when the train abruptly stopped, just two stops away from my intended destination. The other passengers disembarked, and I couldn’t help but wonder if there were more people boarding, or if there was some other reason for the halt. However, my assumption was swiftly proven wrong when the train’s Spanish-speaking driver stepped off and exclaimed, “Estamos deteniéndonos aquí,” which translates to “We are stopping here” in English. Though my Spanish was quite rusty, I grasped the meaning of “aquí,” which meant “here.”
It was at that very moment that a surge of fear coursed through me. The time was around 12:45 AM, and after an entire night of navigating challenges to meet a fellow Liberian, I was now trapped on a stationary train. Looking outside, all I could see were bushes, and the sound of young Spaniards conversing loudly and smoking cigarettes filled the air. Inside the train, I encountered a Chinese lady who appeared shy and possessed a beauty reminiscent of my Chinese classmate, Shuwen. While I couldn’t recall her name, I distinctly remembered the flood of relief that washed over me upon seeing her. Unlike me, her English was limited, and her Spanish, much like mine, left room for serious improvement. Despite the language barrier, we managed to engage in conversation, during which she revealed that she was headed to the second-to-last stop to visit a friend.
At that moment, my sense of altruism took hold. I became more concerned about helping my newfound Chinese friend solve her predicament than I was about finding my Liberian “host.” The night had woven together a fusion of unexpected connections and challenges, revealing the shared threads of humanity that linked us all, regardless of language or origin.
About Alex, the Russian who save my life on the train tracks
After approximately 20 minutes of wandering and conversation, we spotted a train approaching. I halted, and my Chinese friend-in-adventure and I quickly boarded the train. We could not find a Spanish speaker to help us and after the first stop, my friend decided to get off the train. Outside, the night seemed even colder and darker. In the span of 30 seconds, I bombarded her with about five questions, seeking to understand her decision. It became clear that her exit wasn’t due to reaching her intended destination; rather, she appeared quite fearful. Driven by concern for her well-being and a genuine curiosity about her journey, I chose to disembark as well. The time was now around 1:00 AM. Once off the train, she explained that she needed to make this particular stop as it was en route to her destination. However, undertaking this part of her journey alone felt risky, and I pondered whether tagging along might be both a wise and foolish choice for me. I was now faced with the task of charting my own course, yet I had absolutely no clue about my whereabouts.
A few minutes later, we spotted a small group of people across the train tracks. Approaching them, we sought their assistance. As it turned out, they were all headed to the same destination as my friend-in-adventure. A train was due to arrive in just about two minutes. However, when I inquired about my own destination, they appeared to lack information. In those two minutes, I ensured my friend-in-adventure safely boarded the train and bid her farewell. By this point, it was around 1:30 AM, and I found myself alone in an unfamiliar place, my phone powerless and surrounded by the symphony of crickets and frogs. With no inkling of my next steps, I was neither exhilarated by the adventurous thrills nor paralyzed by fear for my safety. I existed in a state of numbness, yet my mind remained incredibly sharp, retaining every encounter and every detail of my intended destination. While placing my faith in God, I desperately needed a tangible guide to direct my earthly path.
After around 10 minutes of aimless contemplation under the dim, cold darkness, I spotted a figure on the other side of the train tracks. He had apparently been standing there for some time, but I hadn’t noticed until now. Swiftly, I made my way towards the man, who possessed distinct Asian features and carried a red Ghana must-go bag. Though I knew nothing about him other than his vague outline, he represented my best chance at finding my way. Upon reaching him, I initiated the conversation in English. While he didn’t respond verbally, his attentive gaze indicated he was listening. When I queried in broken Spanish, “¿Tú hablas español?” (Do you speak Spanish?), he didn’t reply verbally but signaled his inability. This encounter made it evident that he was neither fluent in English nor Spanish. I surmised that he might be from Eastern Europe or Asia, far from home like myself, wandering to his next destination.
Drawing from my limited knowledge of sign language acquired during my brief stint in the Ivory Coast and my early days in Madrid, I managed to communicate with him. Employing these rudimentary gestures, I conveyed my need to use his phone. He gave me his device, and we embarked on a conversation through Google Translate. He introduced himself as Alex, a Russian awaiting the last train that was bound for the same destination as mine. Alex was going to the final stop, and my destination, Cardanyola del Valles, was only one stop away.
Alex was the first Russian I had ever encountered, and his demeanor was as kind as Sergio’s and his willingness to help was reminiscent of Adullai’s. If Alex hadn’t been willing to engage in conversation, provide access to his phone, and offer assistance, I might have spent the night in the middle of nowhere. I might never have met my Liberian “host,” and the course of events could have taken an even more unpredictable turn.
Through a series of coincidences, connections, and the kindness of strangers, I was granted a lifeline just when I needed it most. Alex became an unwitting guardian angel, guiding me out of uncertainty and ensuring I continued my journey, determined to finally meet my Liberian “host” and unlock the mysteries that the night held.
Palm Butter at 3:00 AM
Around 2:00 AM, I arrived at Cardanyola del Valles. The early morning atmosphere was tinged with gloom and solitude. A final challenge lay ahead: a 12-minute walk to reach my Liberian “host.” As I disembarked from the train station, a faint light caught my attention in the distance. I presumed it was a shop, and with a willingness to seize any opportunity, I walked for about five minutes until I reached it. There, I intended to grab a drink and recharge my phone. The women at the shop were hospitable, providing a momentary respite. I used the opportunity to charge my phone and dialed my Liberian “host’s” number. She offered me the most quintessentially Liberian direction: “Walk straight, and as soon as you cross the bridge, turn right.”
Around 2:15 AM, while the ladies at the shop were accommodating, they were also closing for the night. Following my Liberian “host’s” instructions, I proceeded to walk straight and made a right turn after crossing the bridge. However, I couldn’t locate the street address on any of the buildings. After asking numerous strangers and continuing to walk straight while crossing the bridge, I found myself in a perplexing situation. It was then that a couple of helpful strangers informed me that I needed to cross the second bridge, which was around 5 minutes away from the first one I had crossed.
My unease was amplified by the darkness and the unpredictable behavior of some of the strangers I encountered. Observing a nearby McDonald’s, I decided to reach out to my Liberian “host” and inform her that I was unable to proceed any further. The sense of vulnerability I felt in that unfamiliar environment prompted me to prioritize my safety, especially given the hour and the unfamiliar surroundings.
I stayed at the McDonald’s, and within three minutes, I spotted my Liberian “host” walking in, accompanied by another woman. The sight of her erased the earlier feelings of anger, pain, and frustration I had experienced due to her initial inability to provide the support I had expected. In hindsight, I realized that my emotions were more about my own journey than just meeting my Liberian “host.” I felt a surge of happiness, not just because I was seeing her, but because I had refused to give up. I persisted, demonstrated resilience, and come out stronger despite the challenges.
Shortly thereafter, at around 3:00 AM, I found myself on my Liberian friend’s couch, indulging in a familiar dish from Liberia: palm butter and rice. It had been about seven months since I last enjoyed this meal, and its rich flavors and satisfying taste were a welcome treat. Sitting there, I felt a sense of belonging and comfort that I hadn’t experienced in a while. The moment was surreal — encountering a fellow Liberian, savoring a dish from my homeland, and conversing in our native Liberian parlance. No longer did I need to slow down my speech, alter my accent, or speak in standard English, nonstop. I could simply be myself, unapologetically embracing my identity and roots.
My Liberian host was nice after all
My Liberian host greeted me warmly, embracing me with open arms and a genuine sense of hospitality. She willingly shared stories of her own experiences living in Madrid, revealing the mutual connections we had. As we conversed, she emerged as someone who enjoyed a good time but was also driven by a hustling spirit. Having completed her MBA a few years back, she had chosen Spain as her home away from home, embracing it as a place of growth and opportunity.
Finally, the moment arrived when I had the chance to ride in my Liberian host friend’s car, a sleek gray Highlander. Throughout the journey, we played Liberian songs, immersing ourselves in the melodies that connected us to our roots. Eventually, they dropped me off at Hola Hostel, my Airbnb, around 4:00 AM.
The next morning, I awoke and embarked on the train back to Madrid by 1:00 PM.
My trip to Barcelona will forever hold a place as my second most cherished experience in Spain. I am grateful that I allowed myself to fully live through it and finally got the opportunity to share my story with you. I anticipate sharing this story with my grandchildren someday.
Above all, this adventure taught me the importance of proper planning, but even more significantly, it unveiled the beauty of embracing spontaneity.

How I Felt Watching Barcelona Lose – A Fan's Honest Thoughts
It’s not just a football match. It’s not just a scoreline.When Barcelona loses, it feels like a piece of my heart gets bruised.
I still remember the feeling. The final whistle blows. The players drop their heads. And I just sit there, silent, staring at the screen. Not because of the loss—but because of the love. The deep connection I’ve built with this club since I was a kid.
When I watch them lose, I’m not just disappointed. I feel helpless. Because no matter how much I scream at the screen, nothing changes. And yet—I stay. Every game. Every season. Because I believe.
But this loss… it hit harder. Maybe because of how it happened. Maybe because we expected more. Or maybe because I’m just tired of defending a team that sometimes forgets how much they mean to people like us.
Still—I’ll never walk away. Because true fans don’t run when it hurts. We just keep loving harder.

The House on Tibidabo in The Shadow of the Wind
One day during our trip to Barcelona a few years ago we decided to ride all the way to the top of Mount Tibidabo, the highest hill in the city. We had to ride on three separate means of transportation to get to the top, but we did it!
First of all, we walked to the Metro station at Placa de Catalunya and boarded the brown line (L7) train which took us to the base of Avenguda Tibidabo. Then we walked across the street from the Metro exit to board the Tramvia Blau, an old streetcar line, which brought us halfway up the mountain. Finally, we transferred to the Funicular de Tibidabo to get to the top.
There at the top we found an old amusement park adjacent to a Catholic church called Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor (The Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Heart). You can see this church and some of the park’s rides from just about anywhere in Barcelona. And we soon found out that you can get one of the best views of Barcelona from the roof of this church.
In Carlos Ruiz Zafon’s masterpiece The Shadow of the Wind we follow Daniel Sempere as he traces the journey of Julian Carax (the author of a book also called The Shadow of the Wind) to the Tibidabo mansion where his love Penelope resides. Zafon himself loved to ride the tram and then the funicular to the top and gaze at the view of Barcelona. The tram opened in 1901 and the blue cars reminded me of San Francisco’s fabled cable cars. It was thrilling to consider that we may have ridden on the same car that carried both Zafon and Sempere up Tibidabo.
There are many turn-of-the-century mansions that line the slopes of Tibidabo. The most prominent is El Pinar, the home of the banker Manuel Arnus near the base of the funicular and the end of the line of the blue tram. I photographed this house after exiting the funicular on the way back down Tibidabo. I at first thought that this was Zafon’s mansion but later discovered that Zafon himself told us that the address of Torre Aldaya in The Shadow of the Wind was Avenguda Tibidabo 32, which is a few hundred meters down the hill. The building at this address is not as gothic looking like El Pinar and Zafon probably combined the appearances of several Tibidabo mansions when he imagined Torre Aldaya. The building at # 32 is now the Hotel Mirlo, a five-star boutique hotel.
El Pinar was designed by the famous architect Enric Sagnier in 1902 and the house was completed in 1904. Sagnier also designed the magnificent Sagrat Cor at the top of Tibidabo. The church’s crypt was built between 1902 and 1911 and construction of the upper church began in 1915. Sagnier’s son Josep Maria Sagnier completed the construction in 1961. The original statue of the Sacred Heart on the roof of the church was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The present statue, by Josep Miret, was completed in 1950. In this photo one of Christ’s apostles overlooks Barcelona and the huge communications tower on the next hill.
I understand the Tramvia Blau is presently closed for reconstruction. There is a bus (# 196) that now connects the Metro with the funicular.
Zafon wrote The Shadow of the Wind in 2002. It was translated into English by Lucia Graves in 2009. I came across it in early 2015 and immediately began plans for a trip to Barcelona and we flew to Spain later that year. The second book in the cycle Zafon has named The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is called The Angel’s Game. I read most of that book on the plane and finished it during our stay in Barcelona. It is a prequel to The Shadow of the Wind. I then read the third book in the cycle, The Prisoner of Heaven, shortly after returning from our trip. Lucia Graves, the excellent translator of Zafon’s Spanish works, completed the translation of The Labyrinth of the Spirits in 2019. I didn’t get around to reading it until last year. Then I reread the other three books and enjoyed them considerably. I’ll probably read all of them again someday.
Zafon was born in Barcelona in 1964 and later moved to Los Angeles where he wrote screenplays in English. But he wrote all of his fiction in Spanish. He died of cancer in 2020 at the age of 55.
Most of the actions in The Shadow of the Wind take place in the Bari Gotic and Raval neighborhoods south of Placa de Catalunya. Visitors to Barcelona can sign up for a three-hour literary walking tour that covers these areas. Tibidabo is too far away to be included in this tour, however. We didn’t take the walking tour, but we came across many of Zafon’s landmarks while following a couple of walks that Rick Steves recommends in his Pocket Barcelona.
Tibidabo gets its name from two Latin words: dabo meaning “I will give” and tibi meaning “to you.” For more info on Barcelona’s highest hill see my Crow Canyon Journal blog postings here and here. Better yet, read either an English version of the Bible or St Jerome’s translation into Latin of Matthew 4:09. And then read all four books in The Cemetery of Forgotten Books cycle for the full story of the Semperes, Daniel’s friend Fermin Romero de Torres, and that haunted mansion halfway up Mount Tibidabo.

Last summer, I published an article taking a comprehensive analytical approach to FC Barcelona Femení’s 2023/24 season by discussing the principles underpinning their attacking play. When the piece was published in July, it was official that then-head coach Jonatan Giráldez would leave the club for a new challenge in the United States. Later in the summer, it was announced that Giráldez would be succeeded by his assistant, Pere Romeu. Given Romeu’s internal promotion, it was reasonable to expect minimal changes, though every coach brings their own ideas that can fully flourish under their leadership.
Over the summer, some squad changes influenced the team’s autumn dynamics: forward/attacking midfielder Mariona Caldentey left for Arsenal, and right-back Lucy Bronze returned to England to join Chelsea. At the same time, prolific striker Ewa Pajor was signed from Wolfsburg, and forward/attacking midfielder Kika Nazareth arrived from Benfica, as forward Salma Paralluelo was sidelined with an injury/playing overload.
Since the start of the season, Barcelona have been remarkably strong in the 2024/25 campaign. In the league, they currently boast 13 consecutive victories with a staggering goal difference of +50, averaging 4.38 goals per match. In the domestic competition, they convincingly defeated their only serious challenger on paper, Real Madrid, who had strengthened their squad significantly over the summer, with a 4–0 away win. However, the Champions League revealed a rare blemish: a 0–2 loss to Manchester City in the group stage opener highlighted defensive vulnerabilities that are harder to detect in league play due to the game dynamics.
Throughout the autumn, I have closely followed Barcelona and watched all their matches. This article builds on my summer analysis of the team’s attacking principles, comparing their style of play this season to last year. All video material referenced is from DAZN or SVT.
As in the summer article, we begin with a statistical review of Barcelona’s autumn to get a comprehensive picture of their season so far. Are there any differences in the data compared to last year? Does anything stand out? Data is sourced from FBref and Opta, last updated on December 16. Visualizations are courtesy of Ben Griffis’ match report site.
Offensive output
When examining offensive output, there is virtually no difference from last season. Notably, the team maintains the same level of goals per match (4.4), while averaging one more shot per match (26.4 to 27.6). Their efficiency remains consistent, with 0.16 goals per shot compared to 0.15 last season and 0.14 npxG per shot compared to 0.13. In some matches, the team’s xG has reached absurd levels; for instance, in the 10–1 win against Granada, their xG was 7.1. For perspective, the highest recorded xG in the Premier League is Liverpool’s 7.3 against Newcastle on January 1, 2024. Unfortunately, I could not find the highest recorded xG figure globally.
Passing statistics
To identify stylistic differences in the data, we can look at passing statistics. Broadly, there is no change in passing accuracy or the total number of successful passes per match (approximately 680 with 86.9% accuracy). However, there is a noticeable increase in the number of short passes per match, rising from 349 to 393, while the number of medium and long passes has decreased. This suggests closer player positioning. Additionally, there has been a decline in passes and crosses into the penalty area, as well as overall switches of play and crosses.
Possession data
Barcelona’s possession has risen to 74.6% this season compared to 71.1% last year, showcasing their dominance in controlling matches. The team’s field tilt — an indicator of territorial dominance — remains at an extraordinary 89%, a full 30 percentage points ahead of second-place Real Madrid.
A related metric, the difference between field tilt and possession, measures how much more possession a team has in the final third compared to the rest of the pitch. Barcelona leads this category with a 15-percentage-point differential, reflecting the unmatched height of their average possession. Their style of play pushes center-backs far up the pitch, underlining the gap in quality between Barcelona and their league opponents, as well as the respect and caution their opponents exhibit when facing them.
Only Lyon in France surpasses Barcelona in combined field tilt-possession metrics across Europe’s top women’s leagues, while Arsenal matches Barcelona’s levels in England. However, neither team matches Barcelona’s extreme possession and field tilt values, as their possession rates hover around 60%.
Barcelona’s Offensive and Defensive Metrics
Barcelona ranks top in every offensive and defensive possession-related category. These include passing, shooting statistics (shots and xG, both from open play and set pieces), and metrics like xT (expected threat), which measures how much a team creates danger through possession. However, there are two categories related to effciency where they do not place themselves top of the league.
Key Statistical Outliers
Efficiency and style
Despite this deliberate approach, Barcelona scores the most goals in the league by far and boasts a +7.3 goal difference above their xG, a testament to their superior finishing and decision-making. This strategy leverages the squad’s collective intelligence and ability to assess scoring opportunities. The outcome? A high-efficiency attacking style that capitalizes on possession dominance, excellent decision-making, and the technical superiority of their players.
Defensive issues exposed against Manchester City
As briefly mentioned in the introduction, Barca has one blemish on their record, when they lost 2–0 to Manchester City away in the first round of the Champions League group stage. The match was played in early October, with Barca riding a streak of five straight wins against league opposition that they had brushed aside with ease. This was thus the first real test of the season. The match exposed what could actually be called a slack or naïve approach from Barcelona to their defensive game. It demonstrated how a team playing with patience and sometimes speed in their build-up play, and daring to play threatening balls between and over the lines, could realistically challenge Barcelona. City managed to exploit a nonchalant Barcelona team that mistimed their pressing and at times didn’t even show intentions to defend against their opponents with the intensity required against a top-tier City side, featuring players like Lauren Hemp, Khadija Shaw, Vivianne Miedema, and Jess Park. Let’s look at some examples.
Here, Manchester City succeeded by exploiting three factors:
Key (creative) players at fault for this included Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guijarro, which led to others like Keira Walsh, Mapi León and Esmeé Brugts having to compensate, affecting the defensive structure and the spaces left behind in their defensive play. These points can partially be boiled down to a question of the players’ attitude toward the defensive work required but also to the team’s approach to risk aversion in their play.
Pressing in league play, and naïve buildup from opponents
In the league, they are used to taking greater risks, as they are so dominant that conceding a goal here or there due to a ball behind a high line or attackers sprinting past an undermanned rest defense doesn’t matter, since they still average 4.38 goals per match. For instance, they often dare to push their center-backs into the final third (which is the main reason they have such an extreme field tilt), and they prefer to keep their attacking forces higher up the pitch after losing the ball to maximize their impact when regaining possession, compared to a more deliberate rest-defense perspective. As a result, they’ve conceded occasional goals in league matches, having kept just six clean sheets in 13 games. However, in the Champions League opener, Barca showed no clear signs of modifying their game plan toward greater risk aversion against stronger opposition.
In the return match against Manchester City at home, they had identified the problem and approached the game out of possession much more aggressively. They chose a man-marking-based approach to their pressing, a method increasingly common in European football at the time, and implemented it right from the start. With the required intensity, they managed to completely smother City, limiting them to just three shots for a total of 0.2 xG, compared to 13 shots and 1.6 xG in the opening round. Let’s look at a clip of how this could play out.
The ever-recurring tactical question regarding the man-marking approach to defending without the ball is how long a team can sustain the required intensity when facing strong opponents with players technically skilled enough to handle such marking pressure. If you try to defend with such intensity while also maintaining a high tempo in possession, energy levels can drop quickly. Therefore, teams must either change their defensive approach later in the game by lowering the tempo and focusing more on covering spaces or slow down their own tempo in possession. In my view, this depends on the specific game plan, as the importance of certain defensive elements will largely depend on the opponent’s skill in possession.
Barca realized after the first match (although they should have seen this in the opponent analysis before the first game) that City were technically skilled enough to hurt them in their possession play. As a result, they opted for an intense approach in defending without the ball and slowed their possession tempo just enough to sustain the defensive intensity for about 80 minutes, which was sufficient. They returned to their “normal” levels of 74% possession and, in this match, 850 passes, where short passing sequences after ball recoveries were key to calming the tempo and gaining the control of the match they never had in Manchester. Leading 3–0 with ten minutes left, they slowed the pace somewhat, where two of City’s three shots came in the last ten minutes. In this match, they were thus skilled in the crucial tactical balance of tempo.
In the league, we often see teams trying to play out from the goalkeeper in their build-up. In this phase of pressing, Barca usually shows great discipline (it’s sometimes in certain transitional moments defensively that certain players may lack this) and are very skilled at shutting down their opponents with a form of hybrid press, which I consider more marking-oriented but still with elements of players in hybrid roles. We see an example in the match against Real Betis.
After watching several Liga F matches where the same patterns can be discerned match after match — where Barcelona’s opponents attempt to build from the goalkeeper but are quickly stopped, leading to a rather destructive effect in transitions — I am increasingly struggling to understand why opponents’ game plans continue to emphasize this approach. Even if it aligns with their principles, I still find it difficult to grasp why opponents persist in this way when it so often actively works against them when facing Barcelona.
The conclusion from my first article about Barcelona was that I viewed them as a team that values principles over structures. In the final section of the article, I reflected on how these principles borrow elements primarily associated with positional play but also principles tied to discussions around relational play. Most principles from last season remain intact, although some have evolved further. An example is evident in the statistics showing an increase in shorter passes, a consequence of closer player proximity. Barcelona often overload the left side in what, in relational play terminology, is frequently referred to as a “tilt.” You’ll often see a “right-back” like Ona Batlle coming centrally into the pitch, with “six” Keira Walsh moving wide to join her teammates, and winger Caroline Graham Hansen typically maintaining width — a feature they value for creating an outlet.
However, just because a team plays with a clear tilt doesn’t mean it adheres to “relational play.” A team fully embracing relational principles works clearly with inside diagonals and concepts like tabelas, escadinhas, and corta luz. When these movement-based principles aren’t utilized — either due to limited understanding among players of each other’s movements and intentions or because a coach doesn’t sufficiently encourage them — such overloads can become static and ineffective. Defending teams can then fairly easily contain attacks in their defensive third without conceding threatening shots.
How can a tilt look?
In the clip below, we see a relatively static tilt on the left side. However, note in particular how the players position themselves relative to the (fairly small) spaces created on that side but at angles that allow them to receive passes and maintain progression. They constantly adapt to spaces created in the opponent’s defensive structure.
We also see an example of an attack in the final third through an inside diagonal.
In these moments of attacking play, Barcelona have successfully combined forward movements out of a tilt with varying effectiveness depending on the match. How well this works largely depends on which players are on the pitch and who participates in the tilt.
In a video analysis of Barcelona’s men’s team by the YouTube channel The Purist, three qualities were identified in players that make their attacking play so threatening:
A Master at Delivering to Space, a Creative Combination Player, and a Game Breaker
When Alexia Putellas was absent from the team during a period from late November to mid-December, her decisive role as a creative combination player became evident. This was especially noticeable in the league match against Valencia. She served as a crucial link in the left-side tilt, making short-passing sequences effective in breaking down defensive structures by doing what defenders seldom expected. Together with Aitana Bonmatí, they form a sharp and unpredictable duo capable of creative combinations. Alexia often initiates the unpredictable action — whether it’s a backheel, a no-look pass, or participating in a tabela — while Aitana interprets it by either attacking the space where the ball lands or extending the play to the next player in a threatening position.
We see this in the clip below, where Claudia Pina receives the ball from Alexia, and Aitana finishes.
This isn’t to say other players cannot combine creatively, but based on watching Barcelona with and without Alexia, I’ve observed that these combinations emerge more naturally with her as the link. In many other cases, it has taken several attempts before players fully understood each other’s intentions.
Here’s an example where left-sided winger Esmeé Brugts looks to play a one-two but Aitana doesn’t grasp her intent.
Later, we see another instance where the situation is right, and Patri understands what Brugts wants to do. Shortly after, Claudia Pina breaks the deadlock in the match.
Something else that characterizes Barcelona is how frequently they use inside diagonals to attack the box, much like The Purist highlighted in their analysis of the men’s team’s approach in the final third. In many matches, Barcelona rarely appears restricted by a structure or framework-based ideas when attacking the box.
A significant advantage Barcelona gains when executing a tilt is the opposition’s need to respond to the overload, the rotations and movements within it. As noted earlier, Keira Walsh, playing as a “six,” is often directly involved in a tilt rather than serving as a traditional central balance player when attacking the penalty area. If Walsh draws a defender, it allows Barcelona’s opposite “ten,” who is usually positioned more centrally but can shift outward if an outlet is needed, to almost always be free for a switch of play. Walsh also enjoys rotating with her midfield colleagues, who in turn attack the space she vacates. This forces the opponents to shift further if they want to keep up. In this way, Barcelona can confuse defending teams, who suddenly don’t know whom to press.
A clear example of this can be seen in a clip where Walsh (#21) makes a run into an open space on the right side. Manchester City’s Yui Hasegawa (#25), initially responsible for Aitana Bonmatí (#14), must now contend with both Walsh and Aitana. Hasegawa eventually tracks Walsh, leaving Aitana free to receive the ball and play it forward. Barcelona then breaks the press with successive third-player combinations, culminating in Patri finding the perfect angle and delivering a sublime cross-field pass to Salma Paralluelo.
Since Barcelona’s tilt often occurs on the left side, switches of play frequently target the right side. And on that side, we find Barcelona’s most prominent “game breaker” — Caroline Graham Hansen. Her ability to challenge defenders one-on-one, both inside and outside, makes her a formidable weapon. Leading the Spanish league in expected assists (xA) and shot assists, she is crucial to Barcelona’s offensive dynamism. Even in matches where Barcelona slows the tempo with the ball, Graham Hansen can suddenly break away from her marker, drive into the box, and deliver a ball into the most dangerous areas.
We’ve discussed how Barcelona often utilizes tilts in the final third, diagonal attacks into the penalty area through penetrating passes, and creative combinations when the “right” players understand each other. These are examples of relational tendencies in their attacking play. However, when it comes to buildup play — or what might more accurately be called possession establishment — things can look different. In league play, “buildup” from the goalkeeper or deep in the defensive line rarely occurs, as opponents seldom choose to press Barcelona. They know that Barcelona’s players are too technically skilled; any minor error in the press will allow them to bypass it in an instant. Instead, opponents often adopt a compact shape as soon as they lose the ball.
Last season, we saw a Barcelona side that frequently resolved such situations in diverse ways depending on the game’s immediate state, but with clear principles like third-player combinations and overloads in tight spaces — even in their own half. Interesting tactics included forwards dropping deep (as Mariona Caldentey often did), rotations that drew defenders and opened spaces for diagonal progression during the establishment phase, and movements that seemed to create artificial transitions in the game.
In another article, I attempted to define a concept for what Barcelona executed in this part of their play, which I called adaptationism. The term was used to describe how teams use principles to continuously adapt to the game’s immediate state, considering space, ball position, and the positions of opponents and teammates. This occurs regardless of whether one adheres to relational, positional, or a hybrid approach — or perhaps none of these at all.
Barcelona’s evolving possession “structures”
This season, Pere Romeu has chosen to implement clearer structures during the establishment phase in certain matches. This could partly be due to Romeu’s autonomy as a coach but also due to the specific player resources available to him. One notable example is Mapi León, who returned from an injury spell last year and has become the team’s top performer in passes into the final third and progressive passes. León often operates from an advanced position as a left center-back, with Irene Paredes covering behind her. With León’s exceptional passing ability, Barcelona have been able to deploy other players in more advanced roles during attacks.
For instance, Claudia Pina has played much more as a forward this season than last, where she primarily served as a central midfielder. Pina is a player who often doesn’t get the credit she deserves, overshadowed by her high-profile teammates. Statistically, she ranked higher than both Aitana Bonmatí and Patri Guijarro last season, even as Alexia Putellas was out injured during certain periods. Pina also had the most minutes on the pitch last year and is equally indispensable this season.
In one clip, we see Barcelona patiently lure the opponent’s midfield into pressing by baiting them. When they bite, space opens up, allowing Pina to attack it and flick the ball forward to striker Ewa Pajor. Simultaneously, Aitana Bonmatí recognizes the situation and makes a decisive run, setting herself up for a clear scoring opportunity that she later converts.
Structural variations in the establishment phase
During the establishment phase, Barcelona frequently employs the 3–2–5 structure commonly associated with positional play. Occasionally, they use what resembles a three-back formation with a “six” operating fluidly just above, while the “rest” of the team positions themselves slightly further upfield. While this might look like a 3–1–6 numerically, it doesn’t entirely reflect the practical dynamics on the pitch.
In one sequence, Barcelona demonstrates patience, waiting to see if Manchester City will press their central double pivot. However, City opts for a compact shape to block central progression. This narrow defensive setup leaves more space and time for Barcelona to exploit the flanks and maintain their attacking momentum. Mapi León’s progressive passing comes to the fore, as does Esmeé Brugts’ deep ball to Ewa Pajor.
In another example, Barcelona plays with a three-back setup and a “six” during possession establishment, positioning players between the opposition’s defensive lines to disrupt a compact 4–4–2 or 5–3–2. Initially, patience in the backline is key. Then comes horizontal stretching of the defense, followed by a switch of play to create larger spaces on the opposite side. Barcelona advances through shorter passes and carries, culminating in another switch of play. Notably, Aitana continues her run into the assist zone, accompanied by multiple players attacking the penalty area.
Blending football philosophies
These examples illustrate how Barcelona employs principles from various football philosophies in different phases of their attacking play:
Barcelona’s rotations are not confined to a predefined structure but rather aim to influence both their own shape and the opponent’s defensive organization. This interplay of ideas from multiple football ideologies makes it difficult to assign a single philosophical label to the team.
FC Barcelona Femení as a Case Study
The blending of concepts from different football philosophies and their interaction within individual matches — as well as forming the foundation of an entire team strategy — is a fascinating subject. In this regard, FC Barcelona Femení serves as an intriguing case study. Their tactical versatility and innovative approach challenge conventional categorizations, making them a standout example of modern football’s evolving complexity.

For almost a decade, Barcelona was the football club of the purist. Led by its unassuming superstars, the team was hailed not just for its sporting achievements, but its artistry. It was an era of talent, technical elegance, and complete reverence for the football.
Those days are long gone.
You can trace the metamorphosis back several years. Perhaps as far back as the days of Luis Enrique, whose reign saw an emergence of direct football, spearheaded by MSN; Messi, Suárez and Neymar. Under subsequent managers we saw variations on the theme. Ernesto Valverde’s team took on a rugged, pragmatic demeanour. Quique Setién, trying to reverse the trend, only created confusion and contradiction.
But it wasn’t until Ronald Koeman arrived, and Lionel Messi departed, that the flame was truly extinguished.
Barcelona were at home to Granada. 1–0 down in the 82nd minute, accompanied by whistles from the outraged Camp Nou, the Dutch manager pioneered his own forward trident: Gerard Piqué, Ronald Araújo and Luuk de Jong. The ball was flung hopefully into the box, and Barca’s goliaths did whatever it took to bludgeon the ball into the net.
The purists wept. Their club was unrecognisable.
The Ronald Koeman era is over, but the scars remain. On Sunday, against Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona attempted a ludicrous 40 crosses, and ended the game with a front line of Luuk de Jong and Ronald Araújo. Ironically, this happened under the stewardship of the crown prince of ‘tiki taka’ himself, Xavi Hernández.
How did it come to this?
Perhaps there’s method to this madness, or more likely, it’s a symptom of the team’s serious deficiencies. To shed light, let’s examine Xavi’s rebuild project and identify why exactly this is happening, and what the alternatives might be going forward.
Let’s start with the diagnosis.
Forget about ‘tiki taka’ for a moment, or any other fabricated label. Xavi’s goal as Barcelona coach is to reintroduce positional play. A philosophy developed chiefly by Johan Cruyff. It’s a cerebral way of seeing the game, based on angles and distances between players, creation of triangles, instinctive movement. Cruyff claims it took ‘10,000 hours of training to finally reach the level of the Dream Team’. Mastery takes years.
We are seeing only the genesis of Xavi’s version, but it’s clear already that he wants to be a little more expansive than his predecessors. More switches of play, more direct passes, more crosses. As long as the space and movement allows it.
Xavi wants to stretch the opposition and exploit space quickly. To punish teams that stay compact by attacking the wide areas. It has worked. Barca have scored 57 goals in 32 games. Astonishingly, 40% of those open play goals have come from wide crosses.
So what’s the problem? Well, scoring from wide positions is one thing. When Barca have the game under control, there are signs they are acclimatising to the new philosophy. The faults appear when they are losing. When the opponents defend stubbornly and the clock is ticking down.
This is the recipe for a different type of crossing game. One that abandons positional play and ball circulation for low-percentage, high-volume balls into the box. This isn’t a considered approach. It’s a knee-jerk reaction. A response from a team, and a coach, that has no solution to a problem. And it happens for three reasons:
1. Opponents defend deep, with numbers
In each of Barca’s last three defeats, the opponent has finished the game with the same system: 5–4–1. They defend deep, in numbers, with very little space between the lines.
It is the kryptonite for any possession-based team. A nightmare to break down.
Pep Guardiola, another Cruyff disciple from whom Xavi has taken a lot of inspiration, has spent much of his career facing such dilemmas. It took years for him to develop a blueprint. Working from scratch, with an inherited squad, Xavi hasn’t cracked the code. Not yet.
2. Barca’s attack is one dimensional
In this first edition of ‘XaviBall’, Barcelona attack almost entirely down the flanks. Combinations through the centre are limited, largely because of the positions of attacking midfielders (the ‘interiors’). Rather than patrolling the centre, Barca’s interiors stay high and wide. Pedri and Frenkie de Jong are typically closer to the centre forward than they are to the pivot, Sergio Busquets.
Unfortunately, when the opponents nullify Barca’s width, they do not have a practiced alternative. Instead of looking for space in other areas, they double down on the wings, usually with the arrival of Adama Traoré. And the cycle of crossing begins.
3. The squad is limited
None of this is entirely Xavi’s fault. Take a look at the squad and you realise it’s missing a few crown jewels. Centre forward is a particularly barren. While Aubameyang is an excellent goal scorer, he is no creator. His impotence during buildup seriously limits Barca’s attack. Aubameyang has, time after time, lost the ball when it goes into his feet. Attacking through the middle becomes futile.
What the squad does have is two very direct, very effective crossing wingers: Ousmane Dembélé and Adama Traoré. It also has two imperious aerial threats, Luuk de Jong and centre back Ronald Araújo.
Together, these are the ingredients for ‘cross and hope’. Stubborn opponents, no ‘Plan B’ and a deficient squad.
The question for Xavi is obvious. What changes next season?
The solutions to these problems are not easy. But they are simple. Do these three things, and the demons of desperation will be exorcised for good. They are:
Solution 1: Prepare the team more thoroughly for deep, compact defences.
This requires time, patience and above all maturity. To some players it might seem counter-intuitive to take an extra touch, or look for an extra pass, rather than throw the ball into a dangerous area. But composure is crucial, and it has to be learned.
Solution 2: Improve the squad in key positions.
Particularly with a centre forward who can bring another dimension to Barca’s attack. Right back will also be important, to reduce reliance on Dembélé (should he stay) on that side.
Solution 3: Take the emphasis away from winning, and focus on performance.
This might sound controversial. But it’s the mentality that separates Xavi, a relative rookie, from a veteran like Pep Guardiola. Xavi’s language is ‘must-win’. Guardiola says ‘we play our game’. When you take away the pressure of the final result, and focus on executing your game plan, you develop a culture that’s resilient to wins or losses. One that doesn’t rush, or become desperate. You create the conditions for a long-term successful project.
With Xavi’s tenure still in its infancy, and some important transfer windows on the horizon, much can change in the near future for Barcelona. Only months ago this was a sinking ship; now some holes have been plugged. It’s going to take a lot more hard work, and disappointing performances, before we set course for something special. We’re nowhere near Cruyff’s 10,000 hours.
Regardless of a few deficiencies, or blind spots in the system, this is a project that demands time and support.
Given both of those things, the purists will return. And Barcelona will be recognisable again.
Thanks for reading, be sure to leave a ‘clap’ if you enjoyed, so I can keep making more Barcelona content!

Originally posted on alexrawlings.co.uk
A few days before my big move to Barcelona, I found myself talking to my now ex-colleague, Jesús. It was late at night, and we were on the Gatwick Express, heading into Victoria on our way back from the Polyglot Conference in Slovenia. Jesús is from Valencia, and so he took a particular interest in my decision to move to Spain. He asked me if I already had any friends in Barcelona.
“Yes,” I said, quickly. “Lots of friends. So many people, from all over the world. I know all of them.” There was a pause, which I interrupted to re-emphasise: “I have lots of friends.”
“OK,” Jesús replied, cautiously. “Just that I know you know lots of people, but just in case you need anything, my sister’s been living in Barcelona for years now, and she lives very close to where you’re going to be, so if you ever need anything just give her a call.”
I was taken aback. Not only was this so incredibly kind and thoughtful of Jesús to suggest, but the reality is that whenever you move to a new country, you never really know as many people as you think. There are fleeting connections that come and go, occasional numbers exchanged at meet-up groups, people you get on with who then mysteriously leave the country without saying a word… Knowing somebody who actually lived there, permanently, and was from there was like finding water in the desert. I graciously accepted.
The next day, a TV crew from the Catalan News Station TV3 had come to find me at work in London and shoot a short interview about why I was moving to Barcelona. When I met them at reception, the journalist greeted me in Catalan. I then turned to greet the cameraman in Catalan too. He turned out to be from Madrid, and although he understood Catalan, he said he didn’t really speak it because, well, he was Spanish.
The journalist, Sergi Mulero, then told me that actually, although he was Catalan, he came from a Spanish speaking family in Catalunya as well. He’d learned Catalan at school and grew up bilingually, but actually, his first language was Spanish. That was that. We spent the rest of the morning speaking just Spanish.
The day I arrived in Barcelona, the main Catalan TV channel had been playing that report on repeat pretty much all day. When I logged into Twitter, I found hundreds of messages from people all across Catalunya welcoming me, thanking me for choosing them, and wishing me all the best.
That evening, I got a WhatsApp. It was Jesús. “My sister and her family have been watching you all day on Catalan TV, and they want to invite you to join them for lunch,” he said.
I got in touch with Jesús’s sister, Maria, and we messaged in Spanish and arranged to meet that Saturday at 2pm — lunchtime in Spain — by the newly refurbished Mercat Sant Antoni.
Needless to say, I got totally lost. After 20 minutes of walking in circles around the outside of the gigantic, €80 million crucifix that was the Mercant Sant Antoni, I received a phone call. It was Maria, asking where I was. I explained I had no idea, but that I was by one of the entrances. Eventually we found each other, and walked to the restaurant to meet her, her husband, their daughter and her godfather. After we finished greeting each other, Maria asked a question that nobody would ever ask in London.
“Pues ¿qué idioma vamos a hablar? So what language are we going to speak?”
I was taken aback. Weren’t we already speaking a language? Wasn’t it already decided? Every centimetre of my body began to fill with fear that they were going to ask me to speak English to them. How many times had that happened to me when living abroad? How many friendships had I started that turned out to just be glorified free English lessons? I groaned.
“Bueno, es que el idioma de nosotros es el catalán,” she explained while my head exploded. “Cuando salimos a comer los sábados, siempre hablamos en catalán. It’s just that our language is Catalan. When we go out to eat on Saturdays, we always speak in Catalan.”
My head was exploding for lots of reasons. The first, was that I knew Maria was from Valencia. When I lived in Valencia, I remembered distinctly that Catalan (or Valencian, as it’s known there) was always the elephant in every room. Everything — all street signs, all addresses, bus timetables, etc. — was always written in valencià, but nobody really spoke it. I remembered so clearly when I went to the town hall to register my existence in Spain, asking the civil servant behind the desk whether she spoke any Valencian.
“Nos obligan a aprenderlo en el colegio, pero… They force us to learn it at school, but…” she leaned closer, to whisper: “Nadie lo habla aquí. Ni palabra. Nobody speaks it here. Not even a word.”
The other reason was that I knew that although Jesús was very proud of Catalan and had done most of his school in it, he tended to speak Spanish. I’d just assumed that, like the presenter from TV3, he came from a Spanish speaking family.
“Si, és molt estrany. Yes, it’s very strange,” Maria said, switching to Catalan when I asked her about this. “En Jesús era sempre el meu germà castellanoparlant. Tots parlàvem català, i ell sempre contestava en castellà. Jesus was always my Spanish-speaking brother. We all spoke Catalan, and he always answered in Spanish.”
I told them that I loved Catalan, that I thought it was the most beautiful of all the Romance languages, the missing piece of the puzzle between Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese. But I apologised, explaining that although I wanted to learn more Catalan, I had just arrived and my spoken Catalan was weak. I asked them to please continue speaking Catalan as though I weren’t there, but that I would feel more comfortable expressing myself in Spanish.
Of course it was no problem, but as the conversation went on, everyone by default shifted into speaking Spanish. I felt terrible. I felt like that one annoying person at a group of internationals in Berlin who all spoke German but who kept saying “Could we just speak English please so everybody understands?” Forcing people to use a major world language instead of their beautiful ‘minority’ language so they could speak to me was certainly nowhere to be found on my list of things to do when I moved to Catalunya. Yet I’d just arrived, and that’s exactly what I was doing.
It was so lovely to meet Maria and her friends and family, and I really couldn’t have imagined a nicer way to start my new life in Barcelona. I had sudden flashback half way through to last time, when I was living in Valencia, and I used to go out to restaurants on a Saturday for lunch that were always packed full with huge tables of Spanish families and friends eating, drinking, talking and enjoying. I’d always observe them from the tiny table they’d put me on in the corner, thinking that I would never feel the same connection to this beautiful place that they did. I would always be an outsider, a permanent tourist, a guiri. Those thoughts are partly what took me back to the UK, convinced that really you had to live in your own country to be happy. Yet three years later, here I was sitting at the table, chatting away in Spanish and dishing out huge plates of arroz negro.
Yet I felt so bad about forcing everyone to speak Spanish, that I made a pact with myself. From now on, I was only going to use Catalan. Everywhere, and with everyone. Why not? After all, all the signs everywhere were almost always just in Catalan. In most cafés and restaurants you had to play this weird game where you’d decide what you want by reading the menu in Catalan, then translate it back into Spanish so that you could order it from the waiter. Why not make life easier for everyone and just speak Catalan to everyone instead?
Well, almost everyone that is.
Armed with my new Catalanophile confidence, my first target was the new Tim Hortons that had opened up near my house. I’d never heard of Tim Hortons, but apparently it was the place to go in Canada, which is why it made total sense for it to open just off Plaça de Catalunya in Barcelona, where, once again, every single word inside it from the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ signs on the doors to the list of coffees was written in Catalan.
I awaited my turn, and eventually was served.
“Hola, ¿qué te pongo? Hey, what can I get you?” I was asked, in Spanish.
“Bona tarda,” I replied proudly, in Catalan. “Em dones un cafè negre sisplau, i un donut de dolç de llet. Could I get a black coffee please and a dulce de leche donut.”
There was a silence. I had been concentrating so hard on remembering how to say dulce de leche in Catalan that I’d made the whole order focusing on the display case, without looking up. Clearly I had made some horrendous grammar mistake. Clearly I had used some kind of Castillian Spanish word. Something had happened. Something had gone wrong.
Eventually I looked up. As my eyes made their way up to meet dark circles of the man behind the till, they passed over a name badge.
First I saw the name ‘Eduardo’. Then I saw the Colombian flag next to it.
“Oh shit,” I thought.
“Molt bé,” he answered in perfect Catalan with the most beautiful Colombian accent. “És per aquí o per emportar? Is that to have here or take away?”

Barcelona conquered my heart 12 years ago. Since then I have known no other city that enchants me so much. She keeps her memories in the Gothic Quarter and Old Town, and exquisitely dresses up in the architecture of the Eixample.
I recall the words of one taxi driver in Valencia who, with a sigh of complaint, noted that his native city turned its back on the sea, while Barcelona faces the sea flirtatiously. Those who have been there can see the driver’s point.
Indeed, Barcelona was born under a lucky star. It started its growth from the seashore and developed as a port city. The sea predetermined not only its urban development, but also the spirit of Ciudad Condal — a free city, the seat of a county unto itself. It is artistic, independent and constantly changing.
Barcelona consistently irritated Francisco Franco, who espoused centralism and linguistic unification. The burden of dictatorship that constrained Catalan cultural self-identification and sidelined their ancestors’ language amounted to a straitjacket on Catalan identity. Once free, Catalonia erupted in national pride, gained autonomy and enacted widespread use of the Catalan language. Today, picking out a book in Spanish (Castellano) in a Barcelona bookstore can become a dizzying challenge for the eyes.
If you’ve been to Barcelona, you can’t fail to notice red-and-yellow Catalan flags hanging from some balconies, or black stickers with a donkey adjusted to a car bumper. These are the signs of Catalan self-identification. A driver from Madrid, on the other hand, would festoon his car with a sticker of an Osborne bull. This is the animal that witnessed a passionate coitus between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in the explicit movie Jamón, Jamón.
The relationship between Madrid and Barcelona reminds me of the relationship between Moscow and St Petersburg. There is an intrinsic rivalry between the two cities, which can be compared in terms of size, grandeur and cultural imprint.
Still, in my mind’s eye there is no place for competition between Madrid and Barcelona because I tend to view them as cities of the opposite sex. Barcelona sounds like a woman’s name and its architectural lines embody femininity; whereas Madrid manifests itself as a king and has a male energy. Would it not be laughable for a man and a woman to compare assets?
However, nobody would deny that it was not Madrid, but Barcelona that in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was a wellspring of artistic, bohemian and eccentric lifestyle in Spain. The Catalan capital was greatly influenced by Paris. In 1989 the Parallel avenue became famous for its own Moulin Rouge, the El Molino music hall. Another Parisian-like venue was a famous café, Els Cuatre Gats at carrer Montsió 3. It was opened by Pere Romeo, who had previously worked as a waiter and an entertainer in the cabaret Le Chat Noir in Paris. He timely sensed that Barcelona was lacking a tavern with affordably priced food and sounds of a piano. This place was bound to become legendary. The upper crust of the artistic world, namely Santiago Rusiñol, Ramón Casas, Pablo Picasso and Antonio Gaudí held their vibrant round tables there.
Els Cuatre Gats is still up and running. If you are willing to travel back to the early 20th century and see a place where creative ideas were born, you should definitely pin this café on your map.
To help you understand what makes me feel enchanted by Barcelona, I would like to share some of my favourite routes and spots. In my recommendations I will deliberately skip some of the most revered tourist locations.
To start with, I must confess that I loathe La Rambla. The reason is simple. It is overcrowded and has a precarious feel. If you are up for a long straight walk, instead of going down La Rambla toward the sea, turn around and head up the Rambla de Cataluña. This long boulevard is wrongly ignored by the touristic herds, who prefer to ransack numerous shops on Paseo de Gracia rather than peacefully explore the streets inhabited by genuine Catalans. You can see the essence of Barcelona life along the Rambla de Cataluña. There are families with strollers passing by, senior gray-haired couples sitting on the benches, loud groups of friends drinking cañas or eating tapas in the street cafes.
Merging with locals doesn’t exclude the opportunity to do some shopping. Don’t miss Muji, Jo Malone or Zara Home. But the foremost highlight of this boulevard is the elegant architecture of the buildings. Be ready to have a sore neck as you will constantly feel the need to look upward. Soon enough, your long walk will be rewarded with an imposing view of Tibidabo mountain. This name comes from the Latin, meaning “I will give to you”. These were the words that the Devil said to Jesus Christ, trying to tempt Him in the desert with all the riches of the world — and what greater riches could there be, one should think, than the seducing skyline of Barcelona?
Our Savior turned down the diabolical offering. But we, trespassers and sinners, should not refrain from enjoying the breathtaking view of the city. And we should also visit the Temple of the Sacred Heart atop Tibidabo, crowned with a monumental figure of Jesus Christ.
Due to its distance from the city center, Tibidabo is not considered as a main attraction. But I would strongly recommend you to take a bus or a taxi and see the beauty of Barcelona from here, almost from Heaven. I will concede, of course, that Sagrada Familia is a masterpiece beyond human conception, where you will witness a triumph of life, but here in the Temple of the Sacred Heart you will get all that plus a unique feeling of hovering over the city.
In order to feel Barcelona’s heart beating, one should go to Diagonal. Despite its proximity to Paseo de Gracia, this long and important artery is almost free from tourists. Instead of casually dressed foreigners you will see business-like, formally dressed Catalans, who hurriedly park their Vespas along the road and rush to their offices.
As a driver, I prefer to avoid this avenue because of the traffic and frequency of traffic lights, but as a pedestrian, I value this street a lot. I love its architectural attire: the splendid façades and ascending perpendicular streets, Muntaner and Aribau, which lead to Vía Augusta. These streets shape one of the city’s most affluent neighborhoods — Sant Gervasi. Its residents are doctors, professors, lawyers and businessmen. You can see them during their morning walks with their dogs in the tiny lovely Parc Turó or in the nearby cafes enjoying a café cortado or café solo and reading El Periódico on the weekends.
If you are hungry and tempted to try traditional tapas, I know a place that you would like. Cervercería Catalana reflects the easygoing nature of Barcelona — it takes good care of its visitors, but not at the expense of the locals, so be ready to rub elbows with the white collars who come here for lunch. If you choose to munch between 13.30 and 15, you will have to wait for approx. 15 minutes to be seated. But if you come alone, don’t miss the chance to get a place at the bar. Apart from the so-much-talked-about tapas you will face an abundance of fresh seafood and seasonal vegetables on the counter. Don’t be shy, point your finger at whatever raw ingredient you find attractive and in 5–10 minutes you will have it, cooked in the Spanish way. Take advantage of the menu of the day. During the weekdays it includes rice of the day (arroz del día). If you come in good company, bear in mind the Spanish tradition of sharing food, when all the plates with different tapas are placed in the middle of the table. This custom (para compartir) is not only generous but also very useful, as you are allowed to indulge in a symphony of various flavours.
Speaking of tapas, here is an interesting fact. Nowadays it is not a common sight, but 10 years ago you could rate the quality of a bar by the quantity of crumpled napkins thrown under the bar counter. Imagine yourself drinking a glass of wine or a pint of beer, savouring morsels of tapas, wiping your fingers with napkins and throwing them down. For a passerby, a floor covered with paper would be the best advertising campaign.
In tapas bars I prefer to skip the deserts and treat myself to un carajillo con Baileys — a small glass of coffee with Bailey’s Irish Cream. Let me end Part I on that sweet note…

This note is part of my travel series, Giant Leaps: a collection of my experiences from across the globe. You can view all of my trips on here.
Find me on Twitter. Thanks for reading!
Visiting the iconic city of Barcelona has always been a long-standing item on my bucket-list. I am not exactly sure which aspect of the city I was most excited about…perhaps it was the culture. I have always been excited by what looked like incredible food, vibrant nightlife, and extremely passionate people. And, of course, there was the soccer.
I made a special effort to visit Barcelona, en route to Asia, and was lucky enough to spend eight days in the heart of the city (big thanks to my friends who let me crash on their couch).
My first impression of the city came from above. Literally.
Flying in (via London), I immediately recognized Barcelona’s impressively mapped out urban design. Spacious, walkable roads are snaked across a grid, encouraging walking and biking throughout the city.
Cerda’s l’Eixample (Expansion) plan made walking enjoyable almost everywhere — 50 percent of all street space is dedicated to walking space, with the other 50 percent for all other forms of ‘traffic.’ — CityLab
Architecture, as I quickly learned, was an important aspect of Barcelona culture. Their buildings blended art and science. Brilliant curves and mathematical lines came together. Funky shapes and simple circles lined buildings in magical ways. That was Barcelona.
Five years ago, when I moved to Sant Antoni, a neighborhood in the Eixample district (pronounced ‘eshampla’), I was overwhelmed by the endless blocks and blocks of buildings. And on each block, everything looked the same — fruit stands, bakeries, supermarkets, banks, then more fruit stands, more bakeries, more supermarkets and more banks… — Guide
But why? And how? How was the city architected in such a way to provide consistency and accessibility to its urban population?
The godfather of Eixample’s city grid is urban planner Ildefons Cerdà. He believed in healthy everyday living through basic needs — among those are sunlight, ventilation, greenery, and ease of movement.
The uniformity and continuity of squares was designed to eliminate segregation of all neighborhoods. Cerdà believed in sanitary conditions for all social classes.
(This did not completely work, as much of the city suffers from income inequality and rising home prices).
Another interesting thing I had never seen prior to coming to Barcelona was the “chamfered street-corners.”
These were designed in such a way to make traffic move more fluidly while still giving walkers a place to move. There are other interesting phenomenon, further outlined in this article, about Barcelona’s unique design characteristics, like how “all blocks are oriented northwest-southwest for maximum solar access,” or how the buildings were “supposed to be as tall as 16 meters in height as to not block the sunlight for other buildings.”
As I experienced, much of Barcelona’s beauty is non-obvious: subtle splashes of math interwoven in the art.
In roughly a week, I was able to see a great deal of the city and truly immerse myself in what I now come to see as “Barcelona culture” — a mix of going out until 6 in the morning, eating tapas, and admiring the brilliant architecture.
La Sagrada Familia is perhaps Barcelona’s most well-known tourist attraction. The unfinished Roman Catholic church, famously designed by Gaudi, is truly an extraordinary sight. “It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026 — the centenary of Gaudí’s death.”
Like many districts of the city, the area surrounding La Sagrada has tons of small restaurants and bars to sit at and admire the site.
I saw the Arc both during the day and at night. It was built, by architect Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas, as the main access gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. It is definitely worth a quick visit.
The Montjuic Castle sits atop one of Barcelona’s many hills. It is an old military fortress, with an interestingly troubled past, as it was overrun by the Nazis. The view from the top is great, and I recommend taking the tram up.
Growing up both playing and watching, I have always had a keen interest for soccer. Regardless of your passion for the sport, Camp Nou is a sight to be seen. It is the largest stadium in Europe (second largest in the world) and home to centuries of sports’ history. Unfortunately, my visit did not overlap with an opportunity to see a game in action…but I imagined it…
Barceloneta, a seaside neighborhood, is perhaps my favorite part of the city. The beach is lined with dozens of traditional restaurants and bars. All of the best clubs (which are in my mind some of the best in the world) are lined right along the boardwalk. We spent many late nights (and early mornings) in in this area at Opium, Shoko, Pacha, to name a few…
I wish I had more specific recommendations/names, but, in general much of the food across Barcelona is the same: Tapas. Tapas are small appetizer-like items that vary in style/cuisine. My favorites were Patatas Bravas and spicy peppers. We also had great western foods. Bar-wise, we had a lot of fun at George Payne and the Stock Exchange Bar.
In general, Barcelona completely lived up to (and surpassed) many of my expectations. The nightlife scene is really amazing and the people you meet throughout the city are friendly and willing to help you get around.
The city-system is fairly easy to navigate, as there is an intuitive metro system that can take you pretty much anywhere for fairly cheap.
One interesting anecdote, in recollecting on the experience, is just how laid back the culture is there. Perhaps my gut takeaway is that Spanish people, much like Italians and Greek, live for the day — not the year, decade etc. Future planning, in my limited conversations with locals, did not seem to be the big priority (as it feels like it is in the US). This is obviously a generalization, one rooted in a biased sample size, but, nonetheless, I found immersing myself in the “relaxing” environment of Spain to be a fresh injection of culture and presence — to live life, and nothing more (or less).

On the 30th March 2022 at the Camp Nou, one of football’s great amphitheatres, Barcelona defeated their eternal foes, but new rivals in the women’s game, Real Madrid 5–2 in the second leg of their Women’s Champions League Quarter Final in front of a modern record crowd of 91,553. To capture a little bit of history I loaded up a cheap one-shot 35mm camera with some black and white film and got clicking.
Here’s a selection of some of the shots taken across the evening with a couple of bloopers at the end because having just one shot at it means that sometimes the stories the eyes see and the pictures the camera take can be very different.
Camera: Reto Ultrawide // Film: Ilford HP5 Plus 35mm
The modern record set that evening would be broken just a few weeks later. The venue would be the same. The manner of victory for Barcelona, this time against German side Wolfsburg, would be just as emphatic, a 5–1 victory setting the table for a 5–3 aggregate victory that would take them to the final.
There were 91,600 fans on April 23rd 2022. As women’s football continues to flourish the records will continue to tumble.
IF YOU LIKED THIS: If you enjoyed this I have set up a Ko Fi page, if you want to, and you are able to, I’d love your support. The link to do so is here and it can be whatever you want.
Thanks for reading, stay safe and be back soon and as promised here’s a couple of extras just to say thank you for sticking with me to the end.

July. That was the last time I was in Barcelona. I was on vacation with A & M. First time for them; definitely not the first for me. I can barely remember how many times I have been in town: so many times that I can formally nominate Barcelona my third home-town, after Milan and London. I speak the language, I am familiar with the places, I simply feel at home.
Next week I am supposed to be in Barcelona, one more time. I will chair a conference and I have some personal business. I truly hope that everything will be resolved peacefully, that the vote will take place smoothly and that Spain will give local population the right to choose their destiny.

In this series of articles, I will take you behind the scenes of my global adventures conducting executive programs and delivering keynote presentations. Join me as I share my most entertaining and often humorous stories from my decades on the road. You can subscribe to ensure you never miss an article.
Between 1987 and 1988, I spent about one week every month in Barcelona, Spain, consulting for a company that was implementing my multi-track program for corporate transformation. On average, I stayed in that city about five days every month, conducting my programs for about 250 managers and executives in that company.
Typically, on a Monday evening every month, after teaching my afternoon doctoral seminar at the University of Pittsburgh, I would fly from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, where my British Airways plane would then pick up some additional passengers before continuing on its direct flight to London. Once I arrived in London and went through customs, I would then take a flight to Barcelona on Iberia Airlines. Several days later, usually on Saturday of that same week, I would then reverse my trusty route that brought me there in order to travel back to Pittsburgh, so I could again teach my doctoral seminar on Monday afternoon as well as attend to my other university responsibilities during the rest of the week.
As noted, I followed this same routine, once a month, for almost two years. In addition, since I was taking that long, cross-Atlantic trip to Europe, I often extended my stay and traveled to other nearby countries in order to deliver additional keynote presentations or conduct some other top-management programs — before returning to Pittsburgh. It seemed I was constantly “on the road again,” as melodically captured in Willie Nelson’s famous song of that same title.
During my two-year consulting project in Barcelona, the senior executives of that company would occasionally ask me to deliver a presentation or workshop to a group of executives from other companies in Spain in order to inspire those other Spanish companies to also proceed with corporate transformation. The goal was to encourage all those Spanish companies (and Spain as a whole) to become more competitive with their counterparts in other European nations. In fact, in 1986, Spain joined the “European Communities” (12 countries in total at that time), which would later become the European Union in 1993, after the fall of communism and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was clear to me that many Spanish companies knew they had to transform their way of doing business in order to succeed in a much larger — unified — European marketplace.
On one particular occasion, the CEO of that Barcelona company asked me to present my approach to transforming organizations to about 50 distinguished senior executives from other Spanish companies who were already successful inside Spain, but were concerned just how well their organizations would fare when they had to complete with other European companies. Not surprisingly, such an important program had to be planned many months in advance in order to coordinate the travel schedules of those very busy senior executives. To do justice to the anticipated importance of my presenting a completely integrated program for achieving long-term organizational success, the chosen venue for this program was a fancy resort hotel on the top of a mountain, just outside the city of Barcelona. I was absolutely delighted to have been given this opportunity to further extend the reach of my work to several more organizations in Spain — in such a beautiful setting.
I scheduled my usual flights from Pittsburgh to Barcelona. A private car would then meet me at the Barcelona airport and transport me to that mountain-top resort. I was especially looking forward to this exciting adventure, not realizing that simply getting there would be much more demanding than I could ever have imagined beforehand.
When it was time for me to take this special trip to Spain, there was a snowstorm already taking place on the East Coast of the U.S. Since my flights were neither canceled nor delayed, I proceeded on my journey. However, when my Pittsburgh flight was descending on its assigned runway at the Philadelphia International Airport, my plane grazed a service van that had lost its way, due to the blistering snow that had been falling for several hours. Even though we landed safely (after experiencing a huge jolt just before we touched down on the runway), the plane was damaged in the incident and therefore could not continue on its scheduled flight to London. Moreover, there were currently no available planes to take the place of the damaged one. The remainder of my flights to London and Barcelona, therefore, were officially cancelled.
Once all us passengers departed the damaged plane, I checked the flight schedules in the airport lounge: There were no more flights to London that evening. The next flight from Philadelphia to London wouldn’t depart until the next evening. But I had to be in Barcelona tomorrow, since my presentation to those 50 Spanish executives was scheduled to take place the following morning in that mountain-top resort. If I waited for the next flight to London from Philadelphia (tomorrow evening), I wouldn’t arrive in Barcelona in time to attend my own presentation.
In my mind, there was no way I could miss that executive meeting on the mountain top just outside of Barcelona, which had been arranged six months earlier. I had to be there. Period. If that special event did not take place as scheduled, it would be especially disappointing (perhaps even embarrassing) for the Barcelona company that was sponsoring my presentation for those executives from several other companies.
As such, I was in desperate need of a Plan B.
After waiting on a long line to speak to an airport concierge, I learned that there was only one possible way through my current predicament: As it turned out, British Airways did have a flight the next morning at 9 am, which would get me to London the same day, so I could take a later flight from there to Barcelona and still arrive in the evening. But there was a catch: That morning flight to London did not depart from the Philadelphia International Airport (as I already knew from the evening before) but was scheduled to depart from the JFK International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City … which was more than 100 miles from my current location.
Basically, proceeding with Plan B, I would first have to rent a car and drive — through a snowstorm — to arrive at JFK Airport in Jamaica, Queens, by early morning. Ordinarily, the driving time would be about 2 hours between the two airports. But with the bad weather, it was hard to say how much additional time would be needed for my drive to New York City. However, it was now 9:00 pm in the evening, so there would not be any traffic jams on the road going north, other than what slowdowns might occur from the storm. Since I had to arrive in Barcelona tomorrow (so I could deliver my presentation the very next morning), it seemed I had no other choice.
More specifically, that flight to London was scheduled to depart from JFK at 9:00 am in the morning, New York Time, which was 2:00 pm in the afternoon, London Time. That flight was scheduled to arrive at 6:00 pm in the evening, London Time. Doing the math, given those departure and arrival times (taking into account the 1-hour difference in time zone) suggested a four-hour flight. But I knew very well that it usually takes about 8 hours to fly from New York to London, with an average jet speed of about 600 miles per hour. Yet British Airlines was offering that same flight in half the time? Naturally, I asked the concierge: “How is this flight time even possible?”
The concierge then informed me that the Concorde (a supersonic jet that can travel more than 1200 miles per hour) would be making the flight, which would only take half of the usual flight time. Naturally, I (or rather my client) had to pay for the difference in airline fees (since the Concorde flight was much more expensive). But for the time being, money was no object in this adventure: I had to be in Barcelona in time for my presentation! Once I made the reservation for the Concorde (and paid the extra fee), I phoned my contact person in Spain who was coordinated all my educational programs there. I let him know that I would keep him abreast of any changes in my travel schedule. But if everything worked as planned, he would pick me up at the Barcelona airport and drive me straightaway to that mountain-top resort.
After I picked up my one suitcase in the baggage claim area, a service van took me to the airport rental car place. It was now about 10:45 pm in the evening. Because of the storm, they only had two cars left to rent. I was in luck!
By midnight, I was already driving on the road to New York City, thoroughly exhausted from the unexpected events on my trip so far — but I had to keep going. I also had to drive as safely as possible, given the bad weather. In fact, my average speed was only about 40 miles an hour on the New Jersey highway (the posted speed limit was 65 miles an hour), since I had trouble seeing the road through the swirling snowfall.
I finally arrived at the JFK International Airport by 4:00 am in the morning. I had a few hours before I had to check in for my 9:00 am flight on the Concorde. But before I returned my rental car at the airport, I parked on a nearby street, set the alarm on my digital watch, and did my best to rest my eyes and maybe even sleep for a few hours.
At 7:30 am, I was already at the gate, where I then boarded my Concorde flight. Finally, the process was going smoothly. I must say: It was really nice experiencing that super-fast mode of transportation and flying so high in the sky (60,000 feet above sea level) that you could see the curvature of the Earth. As tired as I was, I kept looking out the little window by my seat as I marveled at this amazing technology that would hopefully allow me to fulfill my professional commitment to that inspired group of Spanish executives. Good news: The Concorde arrived in London pretty much on schedule at about 6:15 pm in the evening, local time.
Then I faced the next nightmare on my precarious journey to Barcelona.
When I entered the large room in the Heathrow Airport for going through customs, I was shocked to see a few hundred people who were waiting on a very, very long line to present their passport to a row of customs agents (and answer any questions about their trip and its purpose). My first response: “Oh my God. It’ll take me a few hours to get thought that line!” Since I had missed my previous connection from London to Barcelona (because my plane from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was damaged when it hit a van on the runway), I had to purchase a new plane ticket to Barcelona. I had already discovered that there was only one available flight this evening to that airport, leaving London at 7:45 pm and arriving in Barcelona at 11:00 pm, local time. If I missed that last flight to Barcelona, I wouldn’t get to deliver my presentation as scheduled. I would, once again, be in the exact same predicament as I had been in Philadelphia, just the evening before.
Basically, for me to make it to Barcelona so I could deliver my presentation to those executives on the very next morning, I first had to get through customs, next I had to make my way to the ticket counter in the airport lobby so I could purchase my ticket to Barcelona (and check in my suitcase), and then I had to sprint to the departing gate in time to make the flight, which was only 90 minutes from now. Keep in mind: There was no Internet in those days, so I couldn’t process anything online (such as scheduling my flight to Barcelona, let alone purchasing my airline ticket). I had to get to the right ticket counter, in person, which could only work if I got through customs in a hurry and then make it to the ticket counter in a very short period of time.
With my one suitcase in tow, I walked up to a uniformed customs agent who was positioned in the back of the room and asked him if there was some way that I could get to the front of the customs line, since I had to catch the last flight that evening to Barcelona. I told him that I had to make a keynote presentation the following morning, which was arranged for 50 executives more than six months ago. I exaggerated a little when I added that my professional reputation was at stake, so he would be sure to know that I really needed his help.
The customs agent listened intently and then said: “Everyone in this room has to be somewhere else by yesterday. I’m sorry for your situation, but you’ll have to wait on the same customs line, just like everyone else.” I also listened intently, but I wasn’t pleased with his response, so I asked again: “Isn’t there some way I can get through this line more quickly?” Again, the customs agent responded, “I’m sorry, Sir. But there is nothing I or anyone else can do. Everyone has to wait on the same line before going through customs. Several planes must have landed about the same time, which results in these long custom lines.”
It now seemed that this latest obstacle to my getting to Barcelona on time had thoroughly defeated me. Nevertheless, I thanked him for his consideration and began walking away to get on that very long line as soon as possible — even though the effort would be fruitless in the end. But a few seconds later, I instinctively turned around and walked back to that same customer agent and tried one more time to compel him to join me on my sacred mission: “I appreciate what you are saying, sir, but are you telling me that there is no way under the sun, no workaround, no loophole, no alternative … that would allow me to get to the front of the line?”
This time, the customs agent seemed to express a little more compassion on his face, as if another approach had miraculously, yet instantly, emerged from the deep recesses in his mind. He responded with a brand-new perspective on the current situation: “It seems you are going to keep pestering me for the rest of the evening unless I help you. How about this: If you promise to leave me alone and never bother me again, I’ll take you to the front of the customs line. Just follow me and all will be well.”
He proceeded to walk to the front of the customs line, with me right behind him. In a few moments, I was in the front of the line, showed my passport to the person who sat behind the counter and then answered his standard questions about why I was visiting London.
As soon as I had cleared customs, I thanked my dear friend who had stood right beside me for the entire time, and then I dashed to the designated counter in the airport lobby to purchase an airline ticket (and check in my suitcase) for that last evening flight to Barcelona.
When I was settled in my seat on the plane, I finally could take some deep breaths and reflect on the last 24 hours of my facing — and then surmounting — one roadblock after another on my very long journey to that distant mountain top. Yes, in the end, I made it to my intended destination on time and delivered my presentation to that inspired group of senior executives. Years later, I still marvel at all I had to go through, behind the scenes, to share my theories and methods with people and organizations around the globe.

The race for the Spanish Crown could not get better. Where Barcelona won away from home with an uncertain 2–1 win, both Atlético and Real Madrid lost points: A last minute goal gave Bilbao the three points and Betis halted Zidane’s men with a 0–0 draw.
Following the clumsy 5–2 win against Getafe, Barcelona had to confirm against Villarreal. There’s a difference of level between a relegation side and a European challenger. Something Barcelona noticed very early. Despite having an excellent first half, the Catalans were not exactly comfortable against Emery’s men. A tight marking scheme, almost man-marking, was imposed on the visitors. At times, only Ter Stegen had more time on the ball. Barcelona sometimes found it hard to bypass such an aggressive press, too. Not that the defense helped, where Villarreal set the fight on with the first goal of the afternoon.
Barcelona’s defense forced doubts upon the fans. Villarreal’s defense, on the other end, gave hope. Where Villarreal were comfortable on the wings, where Villarreal found it easy to pass through the centre with through-balls, Villarreal was shaky to put it mildly in the defense. Barcelona simply didn’t seem to be interest into blocking these passes in the first place — that could have prevented so many of Villarreal’s chances — but held on the lack of finishing of the hosts. Fortunately, Barcelona were able to bypass Villarreal’s defense with patience, despite it often needed a lot of positioning and effort.
The reaction of the Catalans was quick. Quicker than anyone expected, including culés themselves. Griezmann first equalized and then put Barcelona in the lead, in only seven minutes. Where the Frenchman is the target of criticism — and rightly so — it’s yesterday that ‘AG7’ has justified his time on the pitch. His goal in the Clasico, his brace today: the man is getting goals, and Barcelona loves to see it. When a 120M signings steps up, and despite the aesthetics might not be there, Griezmann gets the goals when needed. And slowly but surely, he is improving. For how long? What about Dembélé? That is another question.
The second half, however, was somewhat of an unfortunate story, for both sides. Villarreal started in a sub-optimal manner by losing one man to a red card following a dirty tackle on Lionel Messi. On the other end, Barcelona couldn’t take advantage of the situation. With Villarreal pressing even higher, Barcelona failed to control the game. In the wild chaos, a chaos where the Catalans couldn’t score, an incoming goal of Villarreal would be very damaging in the title race. Only one goal was needed, and the 2–1 lead wasn’t for sure the most comfortable lead.
Where Barcelona and Atlético played on Sunday, Real Madrid had to faced Real Betis at home on Saturday already. A fixture of fatigue, one that shows justifies the score perfectly.
There was little inspiration or innovation in Madrid’s team on that (rainy) Saturday. Not that players were already tired between fixtures, but the rain surely didn’t help. Pellegrini set-up a smart pressing scheme, and Madrid had a problem: Breaking the lines. Two of those were on the bench: Federico Valverde and Vinicius Jr. Logical, given that Zidane’s men are set to face Tuchel’s Chelsea in an epic tactical clash. The three points were waiting, but Real Betis reminded Madrid: “You have to win the three points”. Points that were never won, given that Madrid never really managed to break the deadlock.
Madrid had the intentions. Benzema and Modric, together, showed Madrid’s fatigue at best. Benzema couldn’t finish despite some astonishing play, and Modric could barely hold onto his feet — essential to Madrid’s play both on and off the ball, Luka couldn’t run — he was mostly jogging, just like the majority of the team. An excellent representation of the long list of fixture. Except Zidane found out he had a problem on the wings as well. Where Vinicius was needed, Rodrygo and Vinicius were halted. Madrid’s recurrent problem — bar in games where most are fit — remains the lack of ‘x’ factors in the wings. Guardado was comfortable to shut down Rodrygo without too many problems.
Where Madrid’s defending was lazy — or better said, out of touch — Real Betis couldn’t take advantage of Madrid’s weaknesses. Strong enough to stop a fatigued Madrid, but not strong enough to punish Madrid. A sum-up of the fixture, where Betis will regret not taking more points on the score-sheet but happy to have avoided a loss. Madrid, on the other hand, will regret dropping points in the title race when it matters the most.
Atlético’s story is familiar by now. With over ten points of lead early into the 20/21 season, most predicted Simeone’s to collect the damn trophy. At the end of March, with only a few games left, all of this doesn’t look this comfortable as it should have been.
Atlético was the last one of the ‘big three’ to play. Athletic, on the other hand, are also known for being a team ready to sacrifice every single bone available to claim simple three points, a loose match or a trophy. No matter the relative importance of the match, Bilbao is about honor, about fighting for the badge. And yesterday, it was Iñigo Martínez that punished Atlético at the 86'. Where Savic remains composed throughout the match, Felipe found it hard to find his ground. Trippier couldn’t place his crosses accurately either. With the block that Athletic are known to be — and usually, Atlético too — it was never going to work.
Where Simeone thought he found in Correa mid-week his new hero, his new gladiator, the forward couldn’t find the goal. His turns, bamboozling his opponents, couldn’t find the ultimate fruit: The goal. Despite a few shots, Correa couldn’t hit the target, to Atlético’s demise. Only Llorente, out of the three forwards, seemed to display his usual brilliance — far from enough. Substitutes couldn’t help either, may it have been Luis Suarez, Joao Felix or Thomas Lemar. At the back line, Atlético seemed shaky, and in the front-line, too timid. Two ends that explain in a nutshell Atlético’s regrets. They are still first — for now, at least. And it’s up to the others to now take the lead — as Barcelona could should they win next Thursday. Meanwhile, Sevilla have also become somewhat of a surprise guest in the title race — could they also cause some problems? Answer in the next weeks.

Wabi-Sabi is an aesthetic, a way of experiencing life, a belief that worth exists in the overlooked and imperfect. A wabi-sabi journey is slower, personal, less driven. It’s travel with an open heart and curious mind that challenges the self.

So, you like to visit or would like to see Barcelona, but wish it were not so crowded and full of tourists like yourself? Travel writer Susan Kraus has a perfect alternative destination for you.
It was a beautiful autumn afternoon in Tarragona, Spain. Locals packed into the pedestrian-only cobbled streets of the medieval town center, and we were there with them, having found a perch on the side of a rock wall of the 12th- century Cathedral of Tarragona. All eyes were focused on the street, where a parade unlike anything I’d ever seen before was approaching. Costumed figures led the procession and were marching throughout the ranks. There were magical beasts spouting fire (seriously, fireworks and sparklers erupting from mouths and tails), dragons, sea serpents, massive bulls, a mermaid-dragon, and even a giant golden chicken. Diables ( five-foot high handcrafted heads of biblical, historical, and contemporary figures) bobbed past. Surrounding towns were represented by dancers and marchers, all in traditional regalia reflecting their local heritage. Musicians played bagpipes made from goat bellies and skins, drums of all sizes, flutes, and horns. Young girls in white lace dresses and red sashes performed the folk dances of their Catalan traditions. Participating towns were represented by monster mascots and their own strolling bands. It was a riotous mix of colors and sound.
This was the procession celebrating Santa Tecla, a beloved patron saint. Her festival, spanning 10 days each autumn, celebrates the return of a relic, her arm. The year 2022 marked 700 years since its return, but even without that milestone number, it’s clear from the celebrations that this is one very special arm — and that the traditions honoring it are alive and well.
As I stood among the crowd, I couldn’t help but contrast it to a parade in the United States. We would have barricades up and police ensuring no one ran into the street or got close to the fireworks spouting from the costumed creatures. But here there were no barricades, no warning signs. Sitting next to me was a mother, three kids in tow. I asked her if there were rules or guidelines I didn’t know about. She looked confused. “It is Santa Tecla, always the parade like this. So, don’t wear flammable clothing,” she replied, gesturing at two of her children who had run into the street and were hopping up and down around what looked like a dancing, metal-plated armadillo. “See, my kids have on old cotton. They just brush off the sparks.”
After the parade, we walked back to our hotel. In the square, a Catalan band was playing to hundreds of people who were swaying and dancing to the music. There were concerts every night all over the city. People don’t sleep much during Santa Tecla.
But it was the human towers, the next afternoon, the “castels” (castles), that blew me away. Dozens of cities and towns have teams, for the competition; people climb up each other’s backs, stand on each other’s shoulders, many stories high. They do not start to descend, sliding down backs, until a small child completes the tower by climbing to the top and raising a hand. This authentic, exhilarating celebration was our introduction to a city I had never known much about but is now one of my favorite European destinations.
Never Heard of Tarragona? (You’re Not Alone)Like Barcelona, its more famous cousin 52 miles to the north, Tarragona is an eastern Spanish port city on the Balearic Sea, leading to the Mediterranean. It is a modern city of just under 140,000, but with a medieval core of twisty pedestrian streets leading to the magnificent cathedral. Roman ruins seem ubiquitous, from the time when Tarragona was “Tarraco,” one of the earliest Roman settlements on the Iberian Peninsula, more important to the empire than Barcelona, and older than Madrid.
But Tarragona is not detailed in most popular guidebooks, from Fodor’s to Rick Steves. Those omissions are strange because Tarragona feels like how people described Barcelona some 50 years ago — when it was just as wonderful and full of historic and cultural attractions, but not drowning in tourists. Tarragona still has that feel of a rich cultural center, but with less hassle. No lines and no waits for tickets. No jostling in front of tourist photo spots.
Tarragona feels different. Relaxed. One example: Many Spanish cities have a rambla, a tree-lined promenade in the middle of the city where people stroll, congregate, and visit. In Barcelona, Las Ramblas is now congested, tourist-driven, dotted by souvenir kiosks every 20 feet, and full of jacked-up prices and pickpockets. But, in Tarragona, the Rambla Nova is for locals: parents pushing strollers, older couples arm-in-arm or sitting on park benches under the trees, and gaggles of teens checking each other out. There are street musicians, but they are not encircled by throngs of tourists. No kiosks. No pickpockets. This rambla is for the people who live here.
Unlike in Barcelona, in Tarragona it is easy to find wonderful and affordable accommodation. Our hotel, the B&B Centro Urbis, was on a corner overlooking the Placa de Corsini, which was lined with umbrella tables of bakeries and restaurants. Across the Placa was the Mercat Central, built in 1915 to house stalls of butchers, fisherman, and vendors of produce, fruit, baked goods, and flowers. Now, the Mercat Central is an upscale market for all of these goods, along with fabulous take-out food. Within the historic building, there are now escalators descending to a modern, spacious underground grocery store.
A More Relaxed DestinationThe sights and daily bustle of Tarragona became our entertainment. We would watch everyday life from the open window of our room. Each morning, parents walked their kids to school across the open square. Each afternoon, kids kicked soccer balls and rode bikes as parents bought groceries for supper at the Mercat. Street musicians provided a backdrop. After just a few days, we were immersed in a different lifestyle — people walked everywhere, were unhurried, relaxed.
Touring Tarragona was serendipitous. We tossed out the checklist and itinerary; we took hours for a meal. It felt good simply to sip wine and watch the parade of ordinary life, so different from our lives at home, passing by. Of course, there are things to see and do in Tarragona … but being there is pleasurable enough.
To See and Do
Roman Amphitheater — Dating from the 2nd century, when more than 13,000 people would flood this amphitheater to watch gladiators battle — and public executions.
National Archeological Museum of Tarragona — Covers 8 centuries, providing context to understand the city’s cultural evolution.
Circ Roma — Chariot races were held here as far back as the 1st century. Small museum of artifacts. Kids love the tunnels. Great views from the rooftop.
Cathedral of Tarragona — Built on the site of a Roman temple and Moorish mosque, with the Catholic cathedral dating from 1154. I loved the interior cloister. Small museum included.
El Serallo — The Waterfront district has a fishing village feel with pastel houses, waterfront promenade, and cafes with special fish dishes.
Museum of Modern Art — This is a jewel of a museum with changing exhibits. Its modern design is such a contrast to the cobbled streets of the old city that surround it.
Mercat Central Built in 1915 to centralize the stalls of butchers, fisherman, and other vendors, this is now an upscale shopping area.
Casa de la Festa — This small museum celebrates the festivals’ costumes, parade figures and history. Google “Casa de la Festa in Tarragona” to see delightful pictures of parade beasts and diables.
Port of Tarragona Museum — Maritime history, old ships, and artifacts galore are housed in this high-ceilinged, spacious waterfront warehouse.
Beaches — Playa de Milagro is walkable from the city center, along a bay with gentle waves. There are 15 kilometers of coastline, from rocky ledges to sandy coves. Many more beaches with amenities are with an hour’s drive.
Trails — There are 75 kilometers of paths to hike, mountain bike or ride horseback in and around Tarragona. Tourism offices have maps and suggestions.
Aqualon — A water park with slides, rafting, waterfalls and play equipment for youth and with deck chairs under palm trees for parents.
Jungle Trek is an adventure park with ziplines, rope bridges, and forest hikes.
For more Tarragona attractions, see tarragonaturisme.cat
Lodging TipsB&B Hotels (some do not do breakfast, but all have 24-hour coffee) originated in France but is a rapidly expanding European chain. Hotels are smaller, featuring minimalist décor and an IKEA feel. Prices shift with demand, but our shoulder-season rates were under $60 a night. If you’re planning to travel around Europe, consider a low-fee annual membership, with perks like 10% off every stay and more. Staying in Tarragona can be much less expensive than Barcelona, and trains and buses run regularly. Many Barcelona tours are available from Tarragona, with transportation provided.

In case you missed it, Barcelona have signed a lot of players.
Xavi Hernández has a whole new toy box — and while that’s exciting, finding the balance in his starting XI might be akin to solving a Rubik’s cube. Move any one piece, and you realise several others have to move with it.
This is particularly an issue in the back line. Traditionally, the most stable and unalterable part of the team. “You don’t mess with your centre back partnership”, I hear echoed through the eons of football clichés. And if Xavi is to go along with it, finding the right partnership early is of critical importance.
Today I’d like to play God (or rather, football manager) and work through the options Xavi has at his disposal.
We’ll discuss what is required from a CB in Xavi’s system, take a look at each profile, and knit together a winning combination.
This is a long read, so I’ve split it into chapters. Feel free to pick it up and come back to it.
Alright, let’s get started.
On the ball, Xavi’s centre backs have a varied level of responsibility depending on the game phase.
In general build up, when Barca have established possession, the centre backs are integral to ball progression. That’s because they have more time on the ball than anyone else.
Take the example below, against Real Madrid’s mid-block. The centre backs remain narrow, often supported by a full back (Alba), with the defensive midfielder ahead of them.
Madrid are doing what most organised teams will do: 1) man-mark the defensive midfielder and 2) block the passing lanes to the attacking midfielders.
This is a problem that needs solving. The centre backs need to be smart and technical enough to do so. They usually have three options:
The more of these options the CB can execute consistently, the more valuable they are on the ball. If they have a supreme passing range, and can also drive forward with the ball, they tick all the boxes.
Later we’ll look at the data to help us choose our ideal candidate.
Under pressure
The second scenario that Barca centre backs face is heavy opposition pressure. However, Xavi’s team has a tendency to be pragmatic in these situations, looking for a way out as early as possible.
This means the centre backs don’t have as much responsibility as you might expect.
Usually, they will either go backwards to goalkeeper Ter Stegen — who then is tasked with a progressive pass — or sideways to the full backs. The centre backs don’t tend to take risks.
At most, the centre back will be asked to play a diagonal pass, often to the full back. Which is why, if we’re ranking offensive attributes, passing range is the most important.
Calmness is also necessary, of course. Plus the ability to identify and execute these passes quickly.
Now, on to actual defending.
To be blunt, Xavi’s system is extremely demanding on its centre backs. Not only are we looking for an excellent technical profile, but defenders who can manoeuvre in high-risk situations. Xavi’s Barca commit players forward very aggressively, often leaving the centre backs with a lot of space to cover. Especially if the opponent goes direct.
In this example, eight players are caught ahead of the ball, and Ronald Araújo is burdened with a huge responsibility.
It’s not infrequent to see Barca centre backs isolated like this. Here, the decision whether to press aggressively, or slow the opponent down, is of utmost importance. Making the right call, and executing it decisively, is a huge part of the job.
So the next thing we’re looking for is a proficiency in 1 vs 1 duels. An imposing, athletic profile, capable of either winning the ball outright or (just as useful), slowing the opponent down until the midfielders get back.
Statistically, we can look at aerial duels won %, tackle %, fouls committed, and how often a player gets dribbled past to help find our man.
But wait, there’s more.
On top of this, we’re also looking for the best possible ‘traditional’ centre backs. Those that make important defensive actions inside the box, and nulify the opposition at critical moments.
These players are harder to find using raw data, because their decisions require context to understand. However, we will look at some clips to give us an idea at which defenders excel at this.
Ok, let’s summarise what we’re looking for in our ideal centre back. In a rough order of preference:
With all this in mind, it’s about time to look at our centre back choices, and try to find the right balance and partnership.
Age: 23
At 6'1"" and built like a heavyweight boxer, the Uruguyan behemoth is a unique and important profile in Barca’s squad.
He is clearly Barca’s most aggressive, physical and fastest defender. He wins the most aerial duels (73.5%), has the highest tackle success rate (76.7%) and gets dribbled past only 0.28 times per 90, less than anyone except Gerard Piqué.
In other words, he’s outstanding 1 vs 1, and a rugged ball winner who’s not afraid to engage far from his own box. He’s also a major threat from set pieces.
Sounds pretty good, right?
He has, however, shown some lapses of judgement when defending his own area. Often as a result of over-exuberance. Whether it’s abandoning his position, or getting too tight and committing a foul, he can — at times — lack the calmness that typifies the world’s best centre backs.
But Araújo’s bigger weakness is his on-the-ball prowess. While his pass completion number are good, he is often slow to identify the right option. He can be guilty of dwelling on the ball until the passing lane is blocked.
On top of that, he makes more mistakes on the ball and is dispossessed more often than any of the current Barca centre backs (Koundé has more errors, but we’ll talk about him later). This is highlighted most when Araújo is put under pressure.
He is, however, quite effective at carrying the ball forward. His speed and strength make him difficult to dispossess, and he’s brave enough to take responsibility.
All-in-all, we’re looking at a brute of a defender who, while not dreadful in possession, still needs to work on that aspect of his game.
Strengths: Barca’s premier ball winner, excellent 1v1, athletic and quick, not afraid to carry the ball forward
Weaknesses: Vision and passing range, uncomfortable under pressure
Age: 21
I thought it would be fun to put Eric next, because he’s at the other end of the defensive spectrum.
Without a doubt, Eric García is Barca’s best ball-playing centre back. He averages around 95% pass completion, and is by far the most accurate passer over long distances. He’s also the most proactive passer, identifying options and executing immediately. And to complete his passing profile, he’s deadly accurate with both feet.
He’s also very good at carrying the ball through the lines.
But, as I’m sure you know, this all comes at a cost. If Araújo is Barca’s best ball winner, Eric is by far the worst. He wins the least aerial duels (56.1%), is the least effective tackler (a pitiful 37% success rate), and gets beaten more than anyone else (0.75 times per 90).
It’s clear that Eric uses aggression to make up for his lack of physical stature— and it’s not totally in vain. Only Christensen makes more interceptions than Eric (2.29 per 90). But his aggression is a double edged sword; he commits more fouls than anyone else (1.59 per 90).
To give Eric his due, when he doesn’t have to win 1 vs 1 duels, he’s a reasonably stable defender. His anticipation inside the box is usually good, and he’s 100% committed, always. But at the highest level he can and has been bullied.
He’s young, so he has time to develop physically. And his skillset is so specialised that he’s worth keeping around. But you’d be hard-pressed to trust him when it’s do or die.
Strengths: Supreme passer with both feet, identifies passes quickly, carries the ball effectively, a solid box defender
Weaknesses: Loses duels often, commits a lot of fouls, a very inefficient ball winner
Age: 26
Christensen is a new addition to the squad who has already shown a lot of promise. He sits between Araújo and Eric on the real defender — ball-player spectrum, and I’d go so far as to call him the most balanced centre back in the squad.
Defensively his numbers are stellar. He made the most tackles + interceptions last season (3.13 per 90), while not getting beaten very often (0.30 times per 90), and also making very few fouls (0.78 per 90).
We can infer, then, that he’s a very efficient ball winner. Even his tackle success rate (66.7%) is only eclipsed by Araújo.
He’s less aggressive than the Uruguayan, but an equally effective defender in most scenarios. He wins less aerial duels (only 61.9%), but he’s better suited to defending his own box due to his calmness and positional awareness.
Christensen’s other advantage is a rounded profile in possession. He too is capable of carrying the ball forward. But more importantly, he has excellent vision and passing range. After Eric, he’s the most consistent passer over long distances.
A balanced profile that is certainly in contention for a starting position.
Strengths: A composed ball winner, commits few fouls, good vision and passing range, a great box defender
Weaknesses: Aerial duels, not as fast or athletic than some of his competition
Age: 23
Koundé is a very interesting case, and not just because of the fanfare around his signing.
Of all the centre backs in the squad, Koundé is by far the most forward thinking. He is a willing ball carrier, who is often seen marauding into the opponent’s final third.
This offensive movement has been facilitated by Sevilla’s system. The holding midfielder (usually Fernando) drops between the centre backs in possession, creating a pseudo back three. With Koundé on the right, he has license to break forward and become an offensive threat. And he’s not shy about it.
Positionally, this role is quite comparable to how Barca’s inverted full backs operate. It suits Koundé because it makes the most of his ability to break lines, while also remaining an important defensive presence — particularly in transition.
So lets move onto his defensive ability. He is, undoubtedly, an accomplished defender despite his young age. His combination of anticipation, balance, speed and composure is frightening. Not only is he extremely difficult to beat, he reads the game immaculately, making him a superb defender around his own box.
His anticipation borders on prescience; it’s like he’s moving before the ball is played.
In terms of underlying data, he’s most comparable to Christensen. He is dribbled past only 0.33 times per 90 and commits fewer fouls than anyone else (0.72 per 90). His tackle success rate (63%) is middle of the road, as are his aerial duels (64.5% won), but he has an advantage when it comes to speed and athleticism.
You can see why there’s so much excitement around this signing.
Strengths: Excellent 1 vs 1, fast and athletic, great anticipation and composure inside his own box, attacking mentality and high-impact ball carrier
Weaknesses: Lowest pass completion over long distances (73.8%)
Age: 35
Ah, Piqué. A club legend who, even up until last season, was Barcelona’s most important defender. At least, that’s what the data suggests.
When Piqué was on the pitch, Barcelona’s xG difference increased by +0.77 per game, compared to when he wasn’t playing. That’s the biggest impact of any defender last season.
Of course, stats like these need context. Piqué profited from being fit during Barca’s most successful spell of the season. Truth be told, his level has dropped, injuries have blighted him, and physically he sometimes struggles to keep up.
That’s why last season he went to ground more often, and committed more fouls than ever before (1.47 per 90).
However, his defensive numbers are still very adequate. Last season he was second only to Araújo in aerial duels (67.4% won). He was dribbled past less often than anyone (0.22 per 90). He also made the most recoveries (11.8 per 90).
However (spoiler alert) he’s not in my first choice back line.
On the evidence of pre-season, his physical condition is deteriorating considerably. If he can’t be counted on for the vast majority of the campaign, it makes little sense to give him minutes over the other options.
His experience will be useful, as will his leadership. But there’s enough quality in the squad now to warrant phasing him out of the team. And at 35, there’s no shame in that.
Ok, we’ve finally made it. I think this calls for a drum role…
If I were Xavi, my first choice back four would be:
I know, this might come as a surprise. In fact, I’m going against 80% of fans who voted on my Twitter poll. But let me explain.
Christensen — Araújo — Koundé is unbreakable
This is, admittedly, a defence-first selection. By sacrificing a ‘real’ right back I’m taking away an important offensive weapon, right?
Well, not exactly.
As I explained earlier, Barca commit a lot of players forward. At the very least, it’s the front three, plus both attacking midfielders. Sometimes Jordi Alba joins in too. Purely for the sake of balance, I want the remaining players to be defensively imperious. These three — Koundé, Araújo and Christensen — are exactly that.
This decision is made easier by the fact that Xavi’s right back is often inverted. Working in the right half-space, it’s important for the right back to be comfortable on the ball, carry a threat from a deep position, and manage transitions effectively.
Here’s why I think Koundé fits the bill perfectly:
Why Koundé at right back?
Knowing that I want these three in the starting lineup, the question is who’s being ‘sacrificed’ at right back. I’ve gone with Jules Koundé.
The obvious answer is Araújo, but on the evidence I’ve seen, he’s simply not comfortable enough receiving on the touchline or under pressure. Meanwhile, as we’ve seen, Koundé’s role at Sevilla is surprisingly similar to an inverted right back.
For example, he can comfortably receive and progress from the right touchline:
He can drive forward and break lines in the right half-space, which is an incredibly valuable weapon against well-organsied mid blocks:
He can find runners from the right half-space:
He can comfortably snuff out counter-attacks:
And he can defend 1 vs 1 against the world’s best wingers:
It’s unfortunate that, at right back, you might lose his fantastic positional awareness in the box. But for my money it’s a risk worth taking to get both Araújo and Christensen in the starting XI.
Why Christensen at left centre back?
I think Christensen is a fantastic defender. He was a staple in Chelsea’s Champions League winning team, and he’s shown already he can adapt to Barca’s system.
He’s at left centre back specifically for two reasons. 1) I want Araújo on his more comfortable side, because he’s less composed under pressure. 2) Christensen is better equipped to deliver the left-to-right diagonal ball into the right winger.
Barca create a lot of overloads on the left, with the intention of switching the ball over to the right, where Dembélé (or Raphinha) is 1 vs 1. Christensen will execute this more consistently than Araújo.
What about Eric?
I wouldn’t be surprised if Eric García gets decent game time this season. Against teams that provide little attacking threat, perhaps. Equally, I can see him wasting away on the bench.
His performances in pre-season have been excellent. His profile is unique and Barca are certainly more devastating offensively when he’s playing. But at the highest level, the reward isn’t worth the risk.
He has time, though. He’s only 21.
And finally…Piqué?
You might have noticed that Piqué is the only centre back over the age of 26. That’s not ideal. His level might have dropped, but from a squad-dynamics perspective, he’s a useful asset.
I think Piqué will get some game time this year, perhaps to protect a player on a yellow card, or in a rotational situation. But in terms of development, it’s far more important to prioritise every other player on this list.
So there we have it. No doubt plenty of you will have something to say about my selections and reasoning, so I’m continuing the discussion over on Twitter. I hope to see you there.
FINALLY — this is one of the more extensive pieces I’ve put together. If you enjoyed, please do ‘clap’, it helps immensely. And, as always, follow the page for more in-depth Barcelona content.
Until next time!

7 Reasons why FC Barcelona has fallen so low
FC Barcelona frustrated me for a long period of time. They have beaten teams I supported far too often. Now, the situation is quite the opposite, which brought many smiles to my face. However, I didn’t wish them to fall so far of a cliff.
The Catalans were knocked out of a Champions League. In Spanish Primera Divison they are nowhere near the title race. Things that were seasons or months ago self-evident are nowadays anything but that. Let us look at 7 reasons why this is the case.
Everything starts and ends with money. Unfortunately. Due to COVID-19, the club’s income rapidly fell. Because of that players at some point lowered their wages up to 70%. A case where Gerard Piqué had to lower his earnings to the point that newcomers could join the club before the season (Sergio Agüero, Memphis Depay …) was bizarre. With the ability to earn more in clubs that are perhaps nowhere near the rename of Barcelona, footballing superstars are far from being the biggest fans of joining the Spanish giant. Earning more in an environment with less pressure is far more tempting right?
2. Inability to keep Lionel Messi
Related to point 1. was an inability to keep Lionel Messi. The greatest footballer that ever was, didn’t receive permission from the Spanish La Liga delegates that he could play for free (Barca no longer afforded him due to enormous debt). Therefore, he moved to PSG and the club was left without a player that won them trophies and football matches over and over again. Sometimes even simultaneously. It’s true that lately, he stuck his nose in something that he should not have (more on that later), but since decision-makers decided to tolerate it, his departure was a massive blow.
3. Catastrophic recruitment
Since Neymar left, everything went from bad to worse in a transfer market for “Mes que un Club”. The pressure to add a deadly quality to the duo Suarez-Messi (later only Messi) was enormous. And it failed on every single occasion. Barca has spent hundreds of millions of pounds for the likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Philippe Coutinho, and Antoine Griezmann. If anyone justified their gigantic transfer fees then we should all stop watching this beautiful sport right away. It’s as simple as that. Dembélé was struggling with injuries most of the time, Griezmann was with his head still in Atletico Madrid and Barca’s fan opinions stressed in public made Coutinho forget how to properly play football.
4. Inability to stabilize the team’s core
It would be totally unfair if we have criticized only the above-mentioned players. Arda Turan, Samuel Umtiti, Miralem Pjanić, Martin Braithwaite, Andre Gomes, etc. were all high-profile players. Players that would stabilize the team and bring what is required of them. Instead, these mid-size signings if you like, also failed in the long term. The team was extremely far away from the season 2008/2009 when you can name practically the same starting 11 at 3 AM all year long.
5. Lionel Messi
We covered that, right? Nope. We are just getting started. Despite all the unique masterclass, the Argentinian overstepped his authorization far too many times. By giving ultimates to the club president who should they buy and sack, which became publicly known, he tried to position himself as the biggest authority there is. Even bigger than a club itself. Something like a one-man band. Remember, no player is greater than the club. Just ask David Backham’s rubbed face when it was hit by the football booth thrown by Sir Alex Ferguson when the England international tried to do the same. In this case, Josep Maria Bartomeu didn’t have a plan for how to deal with “bossing” Messi. It seemed that he opted for a middle ground by fulfilling and on the other hand rejecting some of his wishes. However you put it, the full extent of such bad influence is seen now. The recruitment process should be dealt with by the people responsible for that. Furthermore, Messi’s lack of defensive engagement only worsened the whole situation on the pitch. Walking on the field after they were losing became a begging to an end of once a brilliant all eleven team effort. And when everyone is not committed 100%, poor results follow, especially on important matches.
6. Shaken European mindset.
After squandering a big advantage against A. S. Roma, uncertainty began to flood through the veins of Barcelona’s players when it came to Champions League matches. After repeating the same against Liverpool a year later, a winning mentality changed immediately. Catastrophes against Bayern Munich and PSG seasons later were written all over. Hmmm. Let me correct myself. Everything even escalated by not reaching the competition’s knock-out phase this year.
7. Sacking Ernesto Valverde
Being first on a La Liga table doesn’t guarantee you keeping a managerial position. Total madness. Before that, Valverde also brought 4 trophies to the club. After sitting top of the table, he was sacked because of … whatever strange reasons you believe. Since his departure “Mes que un Club’s” strength only worsened.
There you have it. If you think, I have missed any, just let me know in the comments below. I’d be happy to agree or disagree.

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

Alright, Barça fans — with love, truly — but who told you to walk into San Siro like you were on a guided tour of the Colosseum? Yes, the Camp Nou is majestic, yes, the Barça DNA, positional play, and all that jazz. But the Champions League isn’t a stroll down Las Ramblas — it’s the Iliad: every match is an epic, and the gods — fickle as ever — love flipping the script right before the final note. And in this opera, the twist came from a character nobody saw coming.
Because watching Barça up 3–2 in the 89th minute, at San Siro, no less, felt like watching Achilles casually sipping tea. “It’s done,” you thought. Victory in hand, job well done. The Inter players looked half-dead, folded back like they knew how this was going to end. But there’s always a Hector ready to charge in — except this Hector was 37 years old, had beaten cancer twice, wrestled with alcohol and depression, and answered to the name Francesco Acerbi.
And this is where it gets good — and beautiful. Tancredi Palmieri told the story on The Iñaki Angulo Show with that mix of awe and disbelief: Inter, on the ropes, legs gone, out of breath — and suddenly… Acerbi! What the hell was he doing up there? Nobody knows. Inzaghi didn’t send him. There was no arrow on the tactics board saying “90th minute, Acerbi turns into last Roman standing.” Even his own teammates had no clue. Darmian summed it up in the mixed zone like a man still dazed: “Nobody told him to go up.”
And there he was. In the 90th minute, body probably screaming, Acerbi showed up in the box like a centurion who missed the retreat call, crashing through the chaos like an old wolf smelling blood in the fog. A loose ball, a single opening — and bang. With his foot, not his head. No flourish, no elegance — just pure grit. He struck it like a man who’d had enough. Goal. Barça stunned. San Siro exploding. Wojciech Szczęsny frozen like a marble statue watching history unfold.
Because Acerbi’s move wasn’t tactical. It was faith. Rebellion. A refusal to accept the script. That goal wasn’t a play — it was a soul cry. A man who’s stared death in the eye — the real kind, and the kind that creeps in silently — knew that some moments don’t wait for permission.
De Rossi nailed it: “Acerbi thought, this can’t happen to me.” And that right there? That’s not football anymore. That’s pure Nietzsche — the will to power. That raw, vital force that doesn’t just want to win, it wants to affirm life, to scream yes in the face of pain and limits and fading odds.
At 37, scarred more than stat-padded, Acerbi ignored the clock, the fatigue, the script — and rewrote the ending. A guy who’d never scored in the Champions League picked that moment to make his mark. As if to say, “I choose when this ends.”
In that improbable leap, in that lone-wolf instinct, the brutal beauty of sports came alive: the best don’t always win, but sometimes the most human do the impossible. And right there, in the chaos and the glory, a story was born. One Barça probably still doesn’t fully understand. But the rest of the football world does.

Written by: Shane Emch, student contributor, Foster School of Business
My study abroad experience has undoubtedly been the most memorable quarter of my time at UW and one of the most transformative experiences in my life so far.
Through my classes, I’ve had the chance to observe the distinct teaching approaches in Spanish education. The country’s remarkable transportation system has allowed me to travel weekly, visiting destinations beyond Barcelona such as Madrid, Tarragona, and Granada. I even had the eye-opening opportunity to spend five days in Morocco with a school group, where I was immersed in a culture vastly different from my own.
The highlight of this journey has been my homestay with a local Spanish family, where I’ve been fully immersed in both the language and culture. Their incredible warmth has made me feel at home, and I feel my Spanish has improved significantly.
This experience has solidified my long-standing interest in a global career, strengthening my desire to pursue a path filled with international opportunities that will continue to fuel my curiosity and passion for cultural exploration.

Restaurants I ate at recently and where I’m heading next

Eating our way through Disfrutar, Bar Canete, Mont Bar, and more
I made our reservation at Disfrutar a year in advance. Literally 365 days. Right before San Pellegrino ranked it the 2024 best restaurant in the world. We planned a whole trip to Europe around this lunch. However, making that reservation was actually the easy part. The hard part was deciding where to eat our other meals. The options were overwhelming, but I ultimately made some hard choices, and I’m mostly happy with my picks.
I’ll cut to the chase — this restaurant was worth the trip!
PROS: The food was exactly as I’d hoped it would be. It was creative, delicious, and fun. It was surprising, but not too weird or serious. One of my favorite things about high-end Spanish dining is how joyful and playful chefs are with their food. We laughed and tried on chocolate rings and exploded walnut shells all over the table and cleaned our hands with water drops shaken out of a red rose. We ate caviar on top of a butter cloud and inside of a doughy bun, spherical-I olives, and golden eggs. We left stuffed, but not painfully so. It’s not the best meal I’ve ever had, but it’s fully deserving of being in the same category as San Pellegrino’s other best restaurants in the world. It’s a much more casual experience vs. something like Noma (which feels like a special event every step of the way), and it’s closer to the El Bulli style with innovative food in an unexpected setting. While I leave most fancy meals thinking one time was enough, this is a meal that I’d actually want to eat again soon. I’m including more photos at the bottom of this post.
CONS: Just two gripes…
(1) When we first arrived, I was horrified that they sat us at one of the two worst tables in the restaurant located in the entry hallway instead of in the dining room. Those two tables should not be used for regular bookings. I feel bad for the staff who have to disappoint two groups at every seating by showing them to these tables. I was worried the lack of atmosphere was going to ruin the whole meal, but luckily, it ended up allowing us to focus more on the food.
(2) The sommelier did not know their wine list and was unable to give a recommendation for a Spanish wine Chablis drinkers might enjoy. Later in the meal, he suggested a second bottle that did not pair well with the richer, hearty final courses. I’d expect more at a restaurant of this caliber. However, the rest of the team provided excellent service.
While the trip was planned around Disfrutar, we certainly didn’t go hungry for our other meals…
Mont Bar — World-class fine dining in a bar
I’m so sad that this restaurant isn’t in San Francisco, because I would eat here regularly if I could. Since reservations for Disfrutar are so impossible, this is the restaurant that I will recommend to everyone I know. They manage to strike a unique balance between a fancy special occasion restaurant and an informal tapas spot (they self describe as “fine dining in a bar”). The restaurant is tiny with space for about 20 people. Most diners are eating the tasting menu or creating their own tasting menu like we did. When I read the menu online, I was worried that the combinations of ingredients were going to be too unusual, but everything came together beautifully. We all agreed the chicken skin squid canape was our favorite bite of the night, but we also loved the sea bass ceviche, mochi with sobrasada, and tuna belly. The nori seaweed and caviar ice cream sandwich was a wonderfully weird way to end the night.
Berbena — Hip newcomer, still finding its footing
The vibe of this restaurant was perfect. It was upscale but casual, with an open kitchen and a small dining area that was full, but not too cramped. The waiters had a warm style, and it felt like they were all friends and you got to be their friend for the night too. They did a great job offering us a range of wine options based on our preferences. The food menu was interesting and diverse, but only had a few standout dishes. You must order the bread with sides (sliced ham and butter), the tapioca & cheddar dadinho (delightful texture and cheesy taste) and all the desserts. Somehow I did not take pictures of any of the best dishes! The vegetables and main courses were all underwhelming, but I would go back again in a different season since the menu changes regularly.
Bar Canete — Old school tapas, worth the hype
I was worried this famous spot would be full of tourists, and it was — but I still loved it (supposedly the locals arrive around 10pm). You’ll have to force your way to the front of a crowd to check in with the host, but as long as you have a reservation they operate efficiently. We were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation. The waiter was high energy and funny and helped steer us towards all the best dishes. We ordered way too much, but I’m glad we didn’t miss the tuna tartar, steak with foie gras, or crema catalana.

Barcelona — Zaragoza — San Sebastian — Cudillero — A Coruña — Madrid — Valencia.
This November I turned 30 years old and decided to celebrate it with my friend Eugene, traveling across Spain. Though I grew up in the far east of Russia, it was a long awaited return to a place where, five years ago, I lived and studied. Spain is also a place that I once called my “foreign homeland.”
After landing in Barcelona, we rented a car, named it “Pepe,” and embarked on our Spanish journey. Throughout the trip we visited seven cities in seven different Spanish regions, going from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coast and back to the southeast of Spain.
Here are some personal impressions of the places we visited.
We arrived in Spain during the pinnacle of a political conflict: “Catalonia v. Spain“ — a perennial debate that has engulfed the region, culminating in Catalonia’s recent independence vote. The day we landed there was a demonstration in favor of a unified Spain in la Plaza de Ayuntamiento de Barcelona. Semi-sober protesters, draped in Spanish flags, were yelling, singing, drinking and dancing in favor of not dividing the country into two.
The following day we went to listen to Estrella Morente’s heart-touching voice. The widely renowned star of Spain’s traditional flamenco music headlined a concert at the iconic Palau de la Musica in Barcelona with her band. While purchasing the tickets I asked the woman at the box office if she liked Señorita Morente. The attendant charmingly looked at me and said, “Of course. She’s the most important singer…from a country that is next to us.”
In Zaragoza, in the Aragon region in between Barcelona on the south coast and San Sebastián, near the French border on the north coast, I met up with my friend Nick, a photographer who recently moved with his family from New York City to a small village near Lleida in Catalonia.
Nick said that after living in New York he feels way more relaxed in Spain. He’s discovered a new lifestyle. Life on the outskirts has its own advantages, including fresh food and a chill vibe, but also its flaws, namely a lack of art that is vital for the nourishment of any artist. Nick loves the region and terribly misses his work, photographing people and making portraits. Gladly, he brought his camera to our luncheon and we did a few shots in the streets of Zaragoza. Ever since meeting Nick in New York a year ago, I’ve considered him my photo inspiration. Every time I face his camera we get lost in the collaborative process and find creative images together.
Barcelona is my favorite city and the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. Or so I thought until I re-discovered San Sebastian, a resort town that is located near the French border on the north coast. Six years ago I visited but I don’t know how I failed to fully appreciate all of its beauty. Walking the streets of the old city and experiencing the sunset from atop a mountain was perhaps was one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve had — ever.
While wandering around San Sebastián, I happened upon a local bakery in town where I randomly met an 18 year old young kid from Guatemala. We sat for coffee and talked. Our surface conversation led us a to a deeper level, sharing personal stories. He told me that his parents found out that he is gay and did not take it so well. He turned sad when talking about his family and said that he didn’t want to have contact with them anymore. He left his home and rented a small room in this city. Now he goes to college in the morning and works at the bakery in the evening. He dreams of being a model and a flight attendant. I was amazed by his strength and focus at such a young age. I was touched by his coming out story. He reminded me of myself and my own.
In Cudillero, a small village in the northwest of Spain, we rode horses for a stroll through the rugged forest to observe the sea from the top of the mountains. It was one of the most therapeutic experiences I’ve had. The beauty and harmony of green Asturian nature mixed with the rhythm and sound of the horse’s hoofs created a sense of pure bliss.
Right before we began the afternoon journey, a small dog approached me. Her fur was matted and messy from the rain, and, she had sad gaze. I caressed the dog and said, “hello.” She was friendly and even with a coat that could use a brushing, quite cute. Five minutes later, as we mounted our horses and made our way to the main road to start the trail into the woods, our guide, Jesus, noticed that the dog was laying on the grass along the narrow road. The dog was dead.
Although we didn’t see what happened, probably a passing car hit the dog. She belonged to Jesus’s co-worker and Jesus started to weep deeply. Tears of sorrow also struck my own heart. It made me think of life and instant death. Five minutes ago I was caressing a dog and looking into her eyes and then …bah… and the soul is gone.
A few days later we went to see Goya’s “Black Paintings” in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Among all of them there was one that grabbed my full attention. Perhaps I would not have been so struck by it if it had not been for the recent accident. The painting, called “Drowning Dog,” represented fatality and mortality. I still keep thinking about it — the painting, the dog and the message.
In A Couña, a port city in the Galician region, I had the most delicious Pulpo a la Gallega. In general, food all over Spain is fantastic. I could eat cheese with bread and drink wine endlessly, as long as its Spanish. The cuisine embraces the pure art of a simple food. No need to go to a fancy restaurant approved by magazines, or entitled with the stars. Just stop by a local bar and ask for un pincho de tortilla con un cortado. Simple and easy … and damn good!
My new acquaintance Davide commented that if you are born in Galicia you have to say that you are Gallego, not Spaniard. In some areas of Galicia if you, as a Gallego, proclaim yourself a Spaniard first, “you might be beaten up,” he said. Two other friends from Galicia were in total disagreement with Davide’s statement when I shared it with them.
Traveling through Spain we faced, on several occasions, statements from people proclaiming their regional pride. Throughout Cataluña we heard how proud people are to be Catalan first, and later in Cudillero, locals expressed pride at being born in Asturias region, then in A Coruña, in Spain’s far corner above Portugal, girlfriends of mine did not let us buy them lunch proclaiming, Vamos a pagar nosotros porque somos chicas Gallegas (We will pay for ourselves, because we are Galician girls)!
Later in Valencia, south of Madrid and back on the Mediterranean coast, people speak Valenciano and feel deeply rooted in their language and its preservation. It was interesting to observe how one single country is so diversely separated by it own dialect, food, language, culture and economics. People throughout the nation persistently point out these differences. It felt foreign as coming from Russia, it never occurred to me, nor any of my friends, to proudly declare that we are from a specific region.
I turned 30 between day and and night somewhere on the road between Madrid and Valencia. I was driving a car, accompanied by an exceptionally beautiful sunset that scattered around the sky and minute by minute as if it were a perfectly composed playlist, changing colors as if they were tracks of music, from mild light blue to loud poisoning red to eventually calm and quiet dim orange. It felt deeply symbolic, driving forward towards new experience without looking back.
Heraclitus once said, ”No man ever steps into the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.“ The more I age the more I get it.
In 2010 I came to Valencia from my home country of Russia to get my Masters degree. I studied Communication at the University of Valencia and graduated in 2012. When I got a job offer in New York City, I left Spain. Needless to say, I felt quite emotional coming back after five years of separation.
The morning after we arrived, I was showing my friend Eugene my favorite places where I spent the best times of my youth. I took him through the river from the City of Arts and Science to the Old City and the City Center. On bikes, we rode to my language school where I studied Spanish, and I wandered through the halls of my university and somehow found myself in the cafeteria. I recall that I was always hungry during that time and looked at the faculty terrace and saw students smoking in groups and chatting about university life sitting on the stairs. I did exactly the same a half decade ago.
It felt surreal.
We greeted the sunset atop Torres de Serrano, where the old town starts. If you climb the stairs of the tower you can observe a spectacular view of the city. At the top there was one young guy playing guitar and one girl clapping in the rhythm of flamenco. The sound of the music, the towers, and the sunset all together were so harmonic that I could not help but dance.
My trip ended in Valencia. Eugene left for the U.S. and I stayed in the city for a few more days meeting new people, discovering and rediscovering old friends and simply walking around Valencia, absorbing the Spanish air, voices, smells and sights. It made me realize that I fell in love with Spain — again. Or perhaps my Spanish romance never stopped, it just took a five year break.
I hope our long distance relationship will continue to develop in some way no matter how far we are from each other.
Traveling by car across the country is the best way to discover Spain. Our car “Pepe” took us from the south all the way through the north and back to the south, more than 2,100 km. Spanish highways are high-end!
Barcelona — Sail the Mediterranean with Enric and see the city from the sea boathttps://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Barcelona-Fun-Sailing/members/204961128/
Zaragoza — It’s impossible to avoid passing it but Basilica del Pilar is an astonishing architectural legacy.
San-Sebastian — Among of the best Pinxos I tried were here at Atari Gastroteka. Calle Mayor 18
Cudillero — Climb to the mirador and take a look at the village from above. It worth it to travel all the way there just to see the view with your own eyes.
A Coruña — Have lunch at Pulperia de Melide ask for Pulpo a la gallega — OMG — this Octopus with potatoes was EVERYTHING. You can not imagine.
Madrid — Dine at Sobrino de Botin — one of the oldest restaurants in the city founded in 1725. Calle Cuchilleros 17
Valencia — Cozy atmosphere, tasty coffee and way too tasty pastries are at coffee shop Dulce de Leche. You can sit there forever and it’s not going to be enough. A place I always want to come back. Carrer de Pintor Gispert 2

Before we went to Barcelona, we thought that Boulder, Colorado, north of Denver, might be the world’s dog-loving capital. In Boulder, you can take your dog practically everywhere, and people do. They’re in restaurants and grocery stores, running alongside their bike-riding owners, playing in dog parks, and going on walks. According to one website, there are 15,000 dogs in Boulder, and one out of three households has a dog.
Then, after our 10 days there, I had to believe that Barcelona residents had to love dogs more. There were dogs everywhere we went.
Imagine my surprise when I looked on Google to discover that neither Boulder nor Barcelona is the biggest dog-loving city. There are lots of cities with more dogs per capita, including Houston, Seattle, Bern, Budapest, and others, including Paris and Denver. But I have to wonder if this website is truly up-to-date.
Barcelona may not be the biggest dog-loving city listed on Google, still perhaps it’s the city that cleans up after its dogs the best.
Only once in 10 days did we encounter squished dog poop on the sidewalk, unlike in Paris, where you have to watch where you step, even in the nicer neighborhoods…

On Monday, April 28, a power outage disrupted travel and daily life across Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and parts of France and Belgium — grounding planes, halting trains, and leaving hundreds stuck in elevators. This is a first-hand account of what it was like to be in the middle of the outage.
“Everything all right? You seem tense,” my wife remarked from the passenger seat. We were in the car, a roaring Peugeot 3008 with brake calipers screaming to be replaced, driving our six-month-old to his pediatrician appointment across town.
I’m a calm driver — somewhere between your grandpa and a limo chauffeur — except for the occasional curse word. At least normally. Yet yesterday, the streets of Barcelona were unusually jammed even for a Monday. I could feel myself getting more tense by the minute. And, apparently, so could my wife.
“Half the traffic lights aren’t working,” I pointed out. “Oh, sh — “ I slammed on the brakes. “That guy on the left thinks he has the right of way.”
“Must be some kind of power outage.”

What does it look like when the idea of care as a practice that sustains life, communities, and cities is considered in an urban context? How can this idea be used to inform projects and planning interventions? Those were some of the questions we brought with us to Barcelona (Spain) where we have been conducting fieldwork this week. Today, we completed our visit as part our ongoing research into care-informed urban planning. The project titled “Care-Informed Urban Planning: Learnings and Exchange Across Countries and Sectors” aims is to generate insights into how care ethics are operationalised in the context of planning and urban governance in selected cases. The insights, exchanges, and warm welcomes we encountered in Barcelona have left us both intellectually energised.
Barcelona is truly intriguing. It is a city that is not shying away from pioneering projects, programs, and interventions informed by ideas around inclusion, Ethics of Care, and feminism. We learned that the Barcelona City Council has set up the Area for Feminisms and Equality, a department with a commitment to gender equality, has established the Councillor’s Office for Feminism and LGBTI Affairs and set up a Gender Impact Assessment (GIAs) tool used in policymaking processes, particularly in urban planning and budgeting. These initiatives are part of Barcelona’s broader Gender Justice Plan, aiming to work on inequality through proximity and diversity and reflect a broader commitment to feminist municipalism, integrating equality into urban governance and public policy.
During our fieldwork, we aimed to understand and gain a clearer perspective on how considerations about care are integrated into urban governance. We are incredibly grateful for the warm welcome and generous engagement we received from everyone who we spoke with.
Barcelona has a rich and dynamic approach to urban governance, where multiple actors are involved in shaping living environments. Care concerns seem to be informing many activities of urban governance. We had the chance to learn more about a range of innovative interventions that make care visible and actionable within the urban fabric.
These include the time use initiative, climate refuges, the justice-based approach to culture, Vila Veïna, and the city’s superblocks (in Esp. superilles). Most of these initiatives are run at the neighbourhood level, and a common thread across these efforts is the idea that care is not just a private matter confined to the home. Instead, care is increasingly recognised as a collective, social, and spatial issue. It is an issue that belongs in the public domain. And as such, it deserves institutional recognition, public investment, professional expertise, and spaces for diverse voices to be heard, especially those historically underrepresented in traditional planning processes.
We’re leaving Barcelona inspired and full of ideas and reflections. Thank you to all those who shared their time, knowledge, and reflections with us.
With gratitude,Romina & Miriam

“Gun store, liquor store, gun store… Where the fuck you taking me!?!” -Dave Chappelle (Killing Em’ Softly)
April 12, 2006
My 3 cabinmates were far lamer than the ones from my other long train trip, so I drank in the bar car by myself and bit my nails until I was drunk enough to pass out. My dad bit his nails too, and I’ve always been extremely embarrassed of the habit as a result. It’s just so hard to quit a drug you grow yourself.
When I woke up, we were in the French countryside, which had no graffiti, but was still quite beautiful, with its’ rolling hills, herds of sheep, and never-ending rows of grapes to be transformed to wine.
That reminds me of a Mitch Hedberg joke…
“I saw this wino, he was eating grapes. I was like dude you have to wait.”
I could feel the temperature, and the moods of the passengers change as soon as we crossed the border into Spain and saw the sea. Only the sea, or maybe a bucket of Xanax, can calm an anxious crowd of travelers so quickly. Anticipation turned to relaxation, as we watched the waves crash into the shore. Redemption was in the air, and I was more than ready for mine.
Stepping off the train, I felt like Uma Thurman in Pulp fiction when she takes the shot of adrenaline to her heart. I was born anew, my past mistakes forgiven. The Berghain, the prostitute, the near arrests… Those mishaps were soon to be a thing of the past. Barcelona, I told myself, would be my travel baptism.
My hostel was only a short walk from the train, and when I got there, I was impressed. It was very much righton the beach. The sand reached the entrance. There were a few guys drinking outside with their shirts off. One of them had a brindle hound he let me pet. Everything was falling right into place.
I was greeted warmly by the manager, who, to my surprise, bought me a beer while I waited for the room to be cleaned — a fine protocol, if you ask me. As soon as my room was ready, I threw on my shorts, along with the flip flops I’d been using to shower, and headed for the beach with my book in tow. On the way, I stopped in a little shop, which looked very much like a New York bodega, and bought a few 20oz Heineken cans. I had my book, my cigs, and my drinks. I was set until dinner.
There were only about 100 people peppered along the beach, most of them drinking in small cliques. I found an isolated area and made myself comfortable. I was almost done with my book and had every intention of finishing it that day.
As soon as I fixed my eyes on the page though, I heard a voice, an American sounding one, holler in my direction.
Guy: What book are you reading?
I looked up and saw three men walking towards me. The one leading the way was pale and gruff looking, maybe 35 years old, with a mullet. He was wearing jeans and a jean jacket.
Me: Hunter Thompson. Ever heard of him?
Guy: No. It sure is big though.
Me: Yep, lots of words.
Guy: Are you making fun of me?
Me: No, not at all. I’m Sam. Here, have a beer. I have one more if you fellas don’t mind sharing.
Guy: Sure, we can share. My name is John. That’s Carlos, and that’s Aaron.
I pulled the remaining two beers out of my bag and tossed them their way.
This was my thinking… Here we had three odd strangers who had been nothing but nice thus far, though I was sensing some odd undercurrents. So, I made a generous offer of friendship, one that would allow me to gather additional information from a position of kindness and generosity, as opposed to weary skepticism. That approach has gotten me far in life. The other benefit was that I was now out of my remaining beers and had an excuse to leave our soiree as soon as my can ran dry. Not bad, right?
Aaron was about 30 years old and didn’t talk so I couldn’t determine where he was from. His skin was weathered from the sun, his blue tank top tattered from years of wear. He wreaked of beer like he’d been drinking for two straight days. And he seemed a bit touched, but that could have been the result of a sun-soaked bender. It was hard to tell.
Carlos looked to be about 20 years old. He was quiet, with dark skin and a 90’s bowl cut. I could tell he was much more innocent than the other two. I assumed he was a local but couldn’t be sure. [SR1]
Both guys gestured towards me but none of us shook hands. We were a crew now, whether I liked it or not. At least until my beer ran out.
John: We need more beer.
He flipped his can over to show me he’d finished it.
I thought, “FUUUUCK, that was remarkably fast,” realizing the trap I’d fallen into. It was now becoming clear that they were homeless people, and John was the leader of the crew. He had me in his sights. I was the mark, and he was going to work me for as much as he could. I scrambled for an out but came up with nothing, so I went along. What were they going to do, kill me after I’d given them beer?
Me: Ok, I’ll go grab a few more.
John: Wait, I’ll come with you.
Me: It’s just right there. I can —
John: I’m coming. Let’s go.
We walked 2 blocks to the store I’d previously been in and grabbed four of the same 20oz. Heineken cans. As I approached the counter, I saw John talking to the clerk, who was handing him a pint of Jack Daniels from the shelf behind the register.
John: Let’s get this too. And some Cheetos. I haven’t had Puffs in like 15 years.
I thought, “What the fuck does he mean by that? Was he away somewhere? WHY WOULD HE NOT HAVE HAD CHEETOS IN SO LONG?”.
Me: Yeah, fine, just total it up. But that’s it. I need have dinner soon and I can’t get that drunk.
I lied. That was exactly my plan.
John: Sure. Of course. You’ll get to your dinner.
John held the bag as we walked back to the beach. We’d only just exchanged names, and I was already 30 Euros in the hole. What little leverage I had was gone.
John: Sam got us food and drinks!
Everyone rejoiced, except me. John pulled the bottle of Jack out and took a big swig, handing it to me after.
John: Here, have some.
Me: Oh, no. I’m good. I don’t even like Jack that much.
John: You’re not going to drink with me…?
Me: I mean, I bought it. That must count for something, no?
John: Still, rude.
I took the bottle and wiped the mouthpiece.
Me: (sarcastically) Is that rude too?
I took a swig and looked back at John. For the first time I noticed the burn marks around his mouth. He saw me staring.
John: Don’t worry, they’re burns, not herpes.
Me: That’s good… Or bad… I’m not sure what you want me to say.
John: My parents burned me.
I ignored him, hoping the subject would change, or a plane would fall out of the sky and crush us all into mush.
John: That’s why I killed them.
I looked up hoping to see the plane. Nothing. Carlos and Aaron were still sitting silently, sharing their beer. They didn’t even look particularly bothered or uncomfortable. All just terrible, terrible signs.
John: I’m not joking, I killed them both.
Me: I believe you. No disagreements here.
John: You can Google it when you get back to your hostel.
He pointed to my hostel, which he’d apparently seen me come from. Another awful sign.
Me: No need. I believe you.
John: Seriously. Give me your book.
He reached out and snatched the book from me, removing the pen I used as a bookmark. He opened it to the last page. That’s when I noticed his nails. They were caked in weeks’ worth of sand and dirt, and there were sores everywhere. He handed me the book back and I looked down at it. It read: “John _____.”
John: Just Google that name and the word “murder,” and it’ll come right up.
Me: Gotcha. Will do. Thanks John.
Just as I slunk back down into the sand, John took another swig of Jack Daniels and yelled, “Hey, check this out!” before tackling Aaron to the ground. It quickly escalated to a fight. People were looking on, but no one seemed to care enough to jump in. People don’t really break up homeless people fights, do they?
Sitting next to Carlos, away from the other two, I tried to gather more intel. Unfortunately, Carlos barely spoke any English. I had some experience from high school and working in kitchens so I did what I could with what I had.
Me: Los conoces?
Carlos: Los conoci hoy.
Apparently, Carlos had just met John and Aaron that day. “What the fuck is going on here?” I asked myself, “I thought they were a roaming band of brothers.” I knew what I had to do at that point; I needed to separate Carlos and I from the murderer(s) before we met a similar fate.
Me: Quiero escaper de ellos conmigo?
I asked him if he wanted to escape with me.
Carlos: Si.
I looked over at John and Aaron. They were still fighting, now even closer to the shoreline, about 100 feet away. I slowly started to gather my stuff, leaving the Cheetos and booze behind as to not raise suspicions.
I looked at Carlos. Surprisingly, we seemed to have an understanding.
Me: Sigueme.
He followed me and we walked as nonchalantly as possible, too scared to glance back. I picked up the pace once we hit the cobblestone road.
Me: Only, 20 more paces. Please, God, don’t let that murderer turn around.
We rounded the corner together then peeked back. John still had Aaron in a headlock. They were all twisted up. We were safe. Carlos looked at me and we both sighed. Then we broke out into laughter, delirious from the fear. Or at least that’s why I was laughing. I wasn’t sure why he was, given he probably didn’t understand John’s admission. I thought about trying to explain it to him in Spanglish but decided against it. Hell, I didn’t even want to know.
The Adderall was wearing off, and I still wanted shellfish, so, in a giant leap of faith, I asked Carlos out to dinner. There I go again.
Me: Tienes hambre? Voy a pagar.
I offered to pay.
Carlos: Por que, no?
He was in.
We walked down a street parallel to the beach, trying to get to know each other. From what I gathered; he was homeless. He was a mechanic by trade, but currently not working. He used to stay with his mother, but that bridge had burned. The only thing he’d eaten that day were the Cheetos.
He spoke pridefully, not seeming to have been broken by the world yet. He had a confident smile and looked me directly in my eyes when he addressed me. That’s always important. He’d lived a lot of life for a 20-year-old but seemed up for the fight.
We passed a couple of oceanfront restaurants before I chose one with a patio that opened to a small dock. It was a lovely place, perhaps too lovely for some underdressed fellas like us. Regardless, we were welcomed in without judgement.
Have you ever seen the scene in The Wire where Bunny Colvin takes the corner kids to Ruth’s Chris, and they don’t know how to behave because of the culture shock? When Carlos accidentally shattered a wine glass, I felt like Bunny, conducting a misguided social experiment. Who was it all for, me or Carlos?
When Carlos came back from cleaning and bandaging his thumb, I ordered us a variety of shellfish, along with a paella to share. I figured we might as well fill our bellies regardless of the awkwardness. And that we did. For the next hour we sat in relative silence, stuffing our faces like garbage-can racoons. The food couldn’t have been better, same as the wine, which I continued to order until there was nothing left on our plates, three bottles in total.
Drunk and extremely full, I paid the waiter and thanked him repeatedly for putting up with us. Then, we exited towards the beach.
That would have been a good time to end the night, I know. But then, I did what I always do.
Me: Donde esta la mota?
Of course, I asked him to find me weed. I knew it was risky, but I was almost out and still had enough Adderall to last for 2 weeks. I needed it. That’s the problem with balancing drugs; if you don’t have enough of one, you can’t fully enjoy the other. I know, it’s madness.
Carlos: Si, Seguro. Necesitamos un taxi.
I got us a taxi and Carlos gave the driver directions.
We drove for much longer than I expected, almost 30-minutes, all of which I spent rationalizing the situation. “Maybe this is where the best weed is? Yeah, that’s probably it… Carlos won’t set you up, you just bought him the meal of a lifetime… At least you have a knowledgeable liaison if things go sideways…”
When we pulled up to our destination, I knew I was in trouble. There were large brick buildings, with bars on the windows, and a centralized courtyard. It was a fucking housing project. Carlos took me to the goddamn projects. Granted, I didn’t tell him the projects were off limits, but for fuck’s sake.
When I exited the car, everyone loitering in front of the building turned to me. They pointed and laughed at my pale legs. I must have looked like an alien to them. My confidence was shot.
Carlos: (hand out) Treinta Euros.
I went in my pocket and gave him the money. He placed it in his underwear and took off into the housing projects.
Me: (sarcastically, to no one) I guess I’ll just chill here with my new friends.
I waited out front of the building, pacing back and forth, smoking cigs, trying to think of an exit plan in case the situation went even more haywire. I popped another 10mg of Adderall too, realizing the night may still be young. A few guys yelled things at me in Spanish, but no one seemed like they wanted to take it to the next level. Still, I was so fucking paranoid.
Then I saw Carlos. He came out of the building with his thumb up and motioned for me to follow. When we got to a more secluded area, he pulled the goods out of his underwear. I was relieved to see a plastic baggie filled with approximately 3.5 grams of green, seedless weed.
Me: WOW! Great job Carlos.
Carlos: De nada, amigo.
He handed me the weed, then pulled a joint from his pocket. I was happy that he didn’t pull it from his pants, but I was confused. “Did he have it the whole time? Was it a freebie from the drug dealer?”.
Before I could contemplate any longer, Carlos lit the joint, took a hit, and passed it to me. I took a hit too and immediately started coughing. I took another hit and did the same. The taste was weird and it made a crackling sound with each puff. “Huh, never seen that happen beeeefffooooor.”
It was at this point I realized that, to my surprise, I was not smoking weed. I was smoking angel dust. The hallucinations started almost instantly. I could barely stand. Carlos, realizing that I was unstable, came to my aid.
Me: Whaaaat wwwaaasss thaaaat?
He leaned in closer, his arm propping me up.
Carlos: I kiss?
His question half-sobered me. Then he leaned in further, his lips pursed.
Carlos: I kiss?
I pushed him away.
Me: No! You do not kiss!!! What the fuck?!
He was pissed. I turned and ran as fast as I could toward the main road where we’d entered the housing project. I looked back and saw Carlos chasing me, screaming at the top of his lungs like a madman.
Carlos: I kiss! I kiss!
I jumped in the first taxi I saw. Carlos was only 40 feet behind us and gaining speed. In my state, it looked like there were 2 of him.
Me: (to driver) VA! VA! VA!
Driver: Tranquillo, senor.
Carlos: (banging on the window) Kiss!! Kiss!!
Me: (to driver) Tranquillo!?! FUCKING DRIVE. VAAAAAAAAA!!
The driver took off and fearfully sped away with Carlos still sprinting behind us. I looked back at him, my heart pounding. He was feral.
Me: Sea Hostel, por favor, y lo siento.
He looked at me quizzically in the rear-view mirror, I think because he assumed I was skipping out on a prostitute without paying. I’m not sure, but it was certainly a look of judgment.
We rode in silence, the cabbie alternating his gaze between me and the road. I kept checking my pulse but lost count of the beats every time my eyes fixated on the bright lights outside my window. I was still hallucinating, but I was at least beginning to calm down.
I had the driver drop me off a few blocks away from my hostel so I could scope out the area before entering. I needed to make sure John wasn’t waiting for me out front to knife me. I wouldn’t have put it passed him. I mean, he slept on the beach only a few hundred feet away and knew I’d be returning at some point.
High out of my mind, I tiptoed quietly up to the front door and slid in. The front desk person saw me and looked concerned.
Guy: Are you ok? Is someone after you?
Me: I think I’m high on PCP. Long story… If a guy named John comes looking for me, tell him I went to Portugal.
Guy: Umm… Ok. How come?
Me: Do me a favor. Please Google “J-O-H-N, _-_-_-_-_-_-_ , M-U-R-D-E-R”
Guy: Why?
Me: I just want to see something.
Guy: It says he killed his parents when he was 16. Do you know him?
Me: May I please check out?

April 13, 2006
The next morning, I woke up feeling like I’d recently smoked PCP and almost made out with a homeless person, which I had, so before eating, I walked a mile to a more private beach and plunged myself into the ocean for a literal baptism. Like Lady McBeth though, no matter how hard I scrubbed, the stain of the previous night wouldn’t come out. In 18 hours, I’d managed to turn my PG-rated redemption story into an R-rated horror film. I’d missed the mark, by A LOT. I needed to get my act together and stop trusting everyone. And I definitely needed to stop hanging out with vagrants. I’ve always had a penchant for hanging out with homeless people. I remember going to a Bar Mitzvah in downtown Chicago when I was 13, and instead of dancing inside with everyone, I took a 2-hour walk around the city and mixed it up with homeless people. Spiritually, I relate. I think it’s the pain that attracts me. Or maybe it’s because I too cannot hold down a job.
Breakfast went down, then came right up, like I assumed it would, so I went to the same shop I did the previous day to get some Tums. The same clerk was working.
Me: Have you seen the guy I was with yesterday again today?
Clerk: John?
Me: You know him?
Clerk: He’s in here every day.
Me: Have you seen him today?
Clerk: (Smiling mischievously) Not yet.
Then, I felt a hand touch my shoulder.
John: Sam! Where’d you go yesterday? You and Carlos just ran off.
Me: I wasn’t sure how long you and Aaron would be fighting, so we went out to dinner.
John: You didn’t invite me?
Me: Sorry, man.
John: Did you Google me?
Me: I did. You weren’t lying.
John: Lying is a sin.
Me: I’m going to take off now.
John: Where to next?
Me: Portugal. Then Russia.
John: Well, it was nice meeting you. You mind buying me some more Jack before you go?
Me: Um… sure.
I paid the cashier, like the pushover I am.
John: Carlos is on the beach, you want to say hi?
Me: No. I gotta go. Madrid awaits.
John: Don’t you mean Portugal?
Me: That’s right, Portugal.
John: You’re not lying, are you?
Me: No, I meant Portugal. I’m going to Portugal.
John: Remember, lying is a sin.
Me: Ok, I’m going to Madrid. My train leaves tonight.
I lied again.
John: Don’t worry, I’m not going to follow you.
Me: Uh, good. It was nice meeting you.
I lied again.
John: Same.
I left the store and booked it to the train station without looking back. Madrid, I thought, was where I’d have to find my redemption.

Who is the greatest football team of all time?
Many people would answer this question with the FC Barcelona in 2010/11. During that season, they won the Champions League, the Spanish League and the Spanish Supercopa. It was a truly successful season. However, there were equal or more successful Barcelona sides in the club’s history. It wasn’t about trophies that made this squad special. Instead, their style of play stood out to others.
Pep Guardiola created a position-based team. Every player knew where to position himself in any given scenario. This positioning enabled Barcelona to control the game. They could hold possession for long periods and therefore have stability.
As the coach himself once said: “Stability is the ball. It’s not to defend 40 meters behind or up front, or high pressing or defend deep or long balls, to be stable as a team is the ball” (Guardiola).
Furthermore, their way of using possession was truly fascinating. Barcelona didn’t just have the ball in sake of having the ball. They constantly seeked for superiority to eventually create chances. It was sometimes slower and sometimes faster, but every pass had an intention.
This article aims to find out, why this Barcelona side is often called the greatest of all time. It mostly covers their in-possession phase as that was most special. But don’t get me wrong, their pressing was incredible too. Nevertheless, most people associate this squad with their possession phase. In the end of this article, I’m shortly going to analyse their counterpressing and why it was so strong.
As already mentioned, the positioning of the players was the most important to create this dominance in their possession phase.
“It’s a game of position, not possession!” (Torrent)
Barcelona’s structure created a lot of diagonal passing lanes and a good distribution all over the pitch. This enabled them to have the ball, progress further up and create chances.
On paper, it was a 4–3–3. But in possession, it was very unusual and asymmetric. It is difficult to describe it with numbers, so let’s have a look on each players role.
Let’s start with the back line of four. The centre backs stayed in the centre and the half-spaces. Besides them, the fullbacks positioned themselves asymmetrically. The right back (usually Alves) moved high up the pitch, nearly playing like a winger. On the left (mostly Abidal) usually stayed deeper. He only moved up on a few occasions, which I will mention later.
The central defensive midfielder (usually Busquets) was the anchor in the midfield. He had a less flexible role than the other midfielders higher up. Busquets mostly stayed in the centre in front of the centre backs and would make horizontal movements. Rarely, he moved higher up.
The two 8s, Xavi and Iniesta also positioned themselves asymmetrically to each other. Xavi on the right played deeper, sometimes besides Busquets to control the game. On the left, Iniesta moved higher up in the left half-space.
The wingers (usually Pedro and Villa) also had different roles. The right winger mostly moved into the right half-space to open the wing for Alves. The left winger usually stayed wide, to open the left half-space for Iniesta.
Lastly, the heart of the squad was their striker, Lionel Messi. He played as a false nine, meaning he constantly dopped deep to connect with the midfield. He often had a tendency, to drop in front of Xavi, to make use of the opened space by the deeper positioning of the Spaniard. Although, Messi’s role was more or less free and he could move wherever he wanted to.
The structure mostly remained the same. It was important that the positions/spaces are occupied, not who occupied them. Most of the time, it looked like in the image above. Though, rotations could occur, meaning the structure could vary for a short period. I will go into detail on these rotations later.
Although, sometimes the structure changed slightly for longer periods, but the principles always remained the same. One change in the structure was e.g., both fullbacks high and wide and both wingers in the half-spaces. This happened mostly when Maxwell played on the left as he is more attacking-minded than Abidal. At this variation, Iniesta would be a little bit deeper.
Only few opponents forced Barcelona to build up deep, as the opposition was often feared of giving more spaces to the midfielders. They therefore sacrificed pressure on the first line of Barcelona’s build-up.
But if the opposition sometimes pressed higher, to put pressure on the centre backs, Barcelona could often easily bypass them.
When pressing higher, most opponents used two players to press Barca’s centre backs. In the deep build-up, Barcelona could use the keeper (Valdes) as the free man, to create a 3v2 overload. The centre backs then would often split wide and deep, to give Valdes more time and space.
The usage of the keeper often had many positive effects to Barcelona’s build-up play. A backwards pass and a pass to the keeper are often pressing triggers for most opponents. This usually led to a striker, who initially marked a centre back, pressing Valdes. Then, the centre back would be the free man.
Even better for Barcelona could be, after a forward, who initially marked a centre back and then pressed on Valdes, another player would take the centre back over. This would again leave a new player free, in a higher position.
This scenario didn’t happen that often, though it showed that Barcelona always had an answer to what the opponent tried to do.
But as already mentioned, most opponents played deeper against Barcelona and would leave the first line free or less pressed.
Still, an overload in the first line was often created, to progress the ball cleaner into higher zones.
Against one striker, the centre backs would naturally have a 2v1 overload, meaning no change in the structure was necessary.
Against two forwards, even though they didn’t press that much, Barcelona liked to have an 3v2 overload. There were a few ways to create the back three:
One was to have Busquets dropping between both centre backs. The centre backs would then move wider and the fullbacks pushed higher up. This enabled the centre backs to be free, have bigger spaces and dribble forwards with the ball.
Sometimes, Xavi dropped between the centre backs or besides one centre back, to create a back three.
The second big way was to use a deeper fullback. Abidal would often stay deeper, to form a temporary back three. This again enabled the centre backs to dribble forward as they had more cover. Moreover, the deep position of Abidal often pulled the opposition’s winger higher, meaning more space were created in the midfield.
As already mentioned, a back three enables the halfbacks to move forward with the ball as they have more cover. This advancing can be very beneficial, to unsettle a deep block.
Many teams aren’t prepared what to do if a centre back starts to dribble with high pace towards them. This quick change of dynamics gave Barcelona an advantage.
One obvious advantage is that by simply moving forwards with the ball, Barcelona was nearer to the opposition goal. Furthermore, it can create a free man or spaces. Any opponent has to press the advancing centre back, no matter what. If no one does, he could dribble freely to the opponent’s goal.
So, one player has to leave his initial marker to press the advancing centre back. This leaves one player unmarked. Either the advancing centre back can directly pass to him, or through another way. Barcelona is incredibly good at finding the free man. Something I will cover more later on.
This is why dribbling is so important for Guardiola: “My first question is always, ‘Can this guy dribble?’ I only want players who have that skill so that’s always what I look at. I want full backs and central defenders and midfielders and inside forwards and winger who can dribble. Because you can learn control and good passing…So, yeah, dribbling, that’s the key.” (Guardiola)
Now that we know, how Barcelona was able to get past the first line of pressure, let’s have a look on how they tried to progress the ball and get into valuable zones to eventually create chances.
First of all, with four players in the midfield (Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta and Messi), Barcelona often had an overload there. These four players mostly formed a box shape or an asymmetrical diamond.
The overload helped Barcelona to find a free player in the centre/half-spaces (the most valuable zones).
Sometimes, the overload was enough, to find the free player. Although, Barcelona also used some interesting mechanisms to find him if it wasn’t that easy.
Now, let’s have a look on some ways to find the free man:
As already mentioned, Barcelona used clever rotations and movements, to unsettle the opposition and eventually create a free man.
You can see the most basic rotation on the image above. Xavi moved deeper, nearly besides Busquets. This allowed Iniesta to move up. Moreover, Messi dropped deeper (mostly in front of Xavi) to create a box structure.
The movement of Xavi usually pulled a midfielder out of position. This opened more space for Messi in between the lines.
We could also often see Busquets making a horizontal movement slightly to the left. This could drag an opponent to the side, which opened space for Xavi to drop into and receive in a deep playmaking position, where he was especially strong.
This rotation occurred mostly, but all in all the midfield box was highly fluid. Sometimes it looked like a box and sometimes like a diamond. Though, the structure wasn’t the most important. What was most important was to create superiorities, find the free man and eventually progress towards the goal.
The fluidity and the rotations had many positive effects and intentions:
The players constantly moved in relation to each other. One big intention was to open passing lanes. Movements could drag defenders out of position, which opened passing lanes and spaces for other players.
The second intention was to move into these open spaces. The midfielders had such an incredible understanding of time and space. They dynamically occupied open spaces. This created a factor of unpredictability and made them harder to mark.
Every midfielder could occupy every space if it had an intention for the collective. That’s why Busquets could also sometimes move into higher zones, to occupy open spaces. The players always moved in relation to each other, therefore, someone needed to occupy Busquets’ central defensive midfield position if he moved up.
Furthermore, the rotations often forced man-oriented opponents to decide between strictly marking or handing over. This is a difficult task to handle. Therefore, a mixture of both often occurred and a player would be free.
Barcelona kept on performing these rotations until a player would eventually receive the ball with time and space. Though, these rotations weren’t the only mechanisms to progress further up.
Barcelona combined the movements with quick combinations, as you can see above. That’s were their famously known Tiki-Taka comes into play.
Sometimes it looked like that they just passed to each other to simply have the ball, but again, every pass had an intention.
“The intention is not to move the ball, rather to move the opposition.” (Guardiola)
The aim of Tiki-Taka, as seen on the quote above was always to manipulate the opponent in a way, to open spaces and create a free player.
Through their structure, Barcelona had small distances in the midfield, which enabled quick combinations that are difficult to defend. The Barcelona players were the best in the world, to execute those combinations.
At the quick combinations, the midfielders and Messi constantly moved related to each other, as already mentioned. Often in the box structure, but also even more fluid, when spaces were somewhere else.
The short passes attracted pressure. Especially, if Barcelona passed to a player with a backwards-facing view. This is often a pressing trigger for the opposition. The opponent thinks he can steal the ball from the player with the suboptimal view, but that’s not the case. The Barcelona player often made a one touch pass, to get out of the pressure. Therefore, the positioning around this player was important to create passing lanes. That’s where the rotations came into play.
When the opponent pressed the Barcelona player with the backwards-facing view, spaces somewhere else open and could be exploited by another player.
Moreover, due to the small distances, many opponents just pressed through and left their initial opponent free, to press another one. Due to Barcelona’s great structure and the mechanisms as already mentioned, they were able to find this free player.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is that the free man should always be supported, to progress further up and use his potential correctly. The midfielders always had that in mind. Their rotations helped the free man to either have more space or a passing option.
Another movement I’d like to mention, which isn’t necessarily a rotation, is the dropping to the side-line performed by Iniesta. This movement can have two effects.
Iniesta could either receive himself with space or he dragged an opponent to the side, opening spaces in the half-space.
Another rotation we often saw was a winger (mostly the right winger) switching positions with Messi. The winger then moved centrally to pin the opponent’s centre backs. This allowed Messi the move around even more.
It was mostly the right winger as he is usually positioned in the half-space and the right fullback occupied the right-wing zone. Meaning no real change in the structure occurred, but different player profiles had different positions.
The opponent often didn’t know how to react to this switch accordingly. The opposition’s fullback was usually tasked marking the winger and the centre backs marked Messi. Now, with the rotations, the opponent couldn’t carry out this task.
This dilemma combined with the high and dynamic role of the right back often forced the back line to leave Messi free and give him even more spaces than in a central position.
This rotation sometimes occurred surprisingly or Barcelona kept this switch of positions for longer periods.
On an individual level, there were two other major ways on how to find and create a free man:
The first was dribbling. I mentioned the dribbling of the centre backs, but also in the midfield, dribbles were very important to progress and eventually create chances.
In the centre, Barcelona didn’t just have the best creators, but also the best dribblers of all time. Players like Messi and Iniesta constantly waved through the opposition with their breath-taking dribbles. But again, this wasn’t just to show off. It also had an intention.
Their dribbles would attract pressure. When a player bypasses an opponent through a dribble, another player has to step up to press the dribbler. This creates spaces and potentially a free man somewhere else. Messi and Iniesta would often bypass numerous opponents and be surrounded by a lot of players.
The other individual way to find and create a free man were disguised passes. This refers to faking a pass to one player and then passing to another. The opponents can be manipulated for example through the view of the eyes or the body position.
This guides the opponent to a wrong passing option. The opponent often moves to the fake passing option, leaving the real one free.
All midfielders, but especially Busquets were masters at this skill.
Another way, to attract pressure were backwards passes. A backwards pass doesn’t gain space. Though, it can be the beginning of a new and better attack. Backwards passes attract pressure as the team with the ball doesn’t move nearer to the goal.
“[…] a back pass does not indicate fear, but the beginning of another, better play.” (Guardiola)
Mostly, only few players of the opponent move up after a backwards pass. This is dangerous, as these players leave their deeper positions, which can open space between the lines if the other teammates don’t move up.
If the whole team moves up after a backwards pass, spaces between the lines stay narrow and therefore difficult to access. Though, spaces behind can enlarge. If the forwards exploit these spaces, they have a dynamical advantage as the opposition just moved forwards.
Especially for Barcelona, the ability to attract pressure was very important as many opponents just sat deep and tried to defend with eleven players. Being able to constantly manipulate the opponent was a big factor of their incredible in-possession phase.
Sometimes, these mechanisms weren’t enough and Barcelona wasn’t able to get into valuable zones. This mostly happened if the opponent tried to congest the centre with as many players as possible.
The opponents would either use four midfielders or their wingers tucking inside (this occurred more often). This obviously helped the opponents to control the centre and give Barcelona’s midfielders less time and space.
But this led to another problem. By congesting the centre, spaces wide enlarged. This is also why Guardiola always wanted to have both wing zones occupied.
Through the constant occupation of both wing zones (mostly by the wingers or fullbacks), Barcelona could stretch the opposition and had always a passing option wide if the centre was congested.
Sometimes, Barcelona could purposefully play wide. An example would be the overload to isolate principle. This refers to creating an overload on one side of the pitch and then switching to the other side, to create a 1v1 there.
Barcelona often combined the switches with the pinning of the ball-far fullback. This would create even more spaces wide.
Barcelona had amazing wingers and fullbacks with incredible dribbling and crossing abilities. So, it wasn’t really a downgrade compared to going centrally. Nevertheless, Barcelona preferred to go through the middle.
“You have the ball on one side, to finish on the other.” (Guardiola)
Similar to the overload to isolate principle, generally Barcelona used a lot of switches to progress and create chances. Often, the opponents were able to have good local compactness at a specific area and stopped Barcelona from progress. From here, backwards passes and switches were very important.
I already wrote about why backwards passes are so important and why Barcelona used them. Something I didn’t mention was the position of a relay player. This refers to a player who positions himself behind others, to be a back pass option. Combined with the wing zone, Pep Guardiola always wanted to have this space/position occupied.
When being stuck on the wing, a backwards pass option can be highly important. That’s where the relay player comes into play. He usually positioned himself behind the wide player and in the half-space. This was near enough to the wide player and near enough to stay connected with the other players to potentially switch the point of attack.
As seen on an image earlier, which I used to represent a backwards pass, Alves is the relay player in the right half-space. Though, mostly a midfielder (Xavi & Iniesta) provided this back pass option. Sometimes the fullback would stay deeper in the relay player position.
Another position which is very important to be able to switch is the link playing position. Guardiola too always wanted to have this position/space occupied. The link player was mostly positioned centrally in front of the block. He can be the immediate option for the relay player or the player to play a switch to the other side.
Again, it didn’t matter who occupied this space unless it was occupied. But it was mostly Busquets, who positioned himself there. Sometimes, an 8 could occupy this space.
The link player is very similar to the relay player, as he can also be a back pass option. Though, he is positioned differently and even more important for a successful switch.
Many teams congested specific areas. Being able to switch the point of attack elsewhere had many positive effects. Due to those switches, the opponent constantly had to shift across. Sooner or later, the opponent just makes a mistake. For example, someone pushed up to far or someone didn’t move to the other side accordingly.
Although, the act of switching alone isn’t really effective. Sometimes, it can open spaces and create a free man, but mostly it’s about the following action. After a switch, it’s important to support the receiver and force the opponent to make as many decisions as possible.
This quote from Adin Osmanbasic summarizes best Barcelona’s way on how to find the free man: “The goal is to find the free or unmarked man by moving the ball, positioning, or player movement” (Osmanbasic).
Another big chance creation method was combined with Messi’s dropping movement in a false nine position. His dropping move often pulled a centre back out of position, opening spaces in behind. Immediately, as Messi dropped deep, other players (mostly wingers) started to make diagonal runs in behind, to exploit this space.
Villa and Pedro were very fast and had a great timing. Therefore, these runs often caused the opposition big troubles. They also looked to make these runs on the blindside of the opposition, making them even more effective.
Messi could then use his outstanding passing qualities to pick a run of his teammates. Sometimes, Messi would lay it off to another teammate who then could find the running players with a forward-facing view.
This chance creation method mostly was successful against opponents with a high defensive line. But it could also be seen to attack crosses in this way.
Everything I mentioned in this chapter combined forced the opponent to make as many decisions as possible. No matter what the opposition tried to do, Barcelona always seemed to have an answer and the opponent more and more questions.
I’d like to finish this section with a quote from the famous basketball player Stephen Curry, which perfectly describes Barcelona’s aim in possession: “The main goal is to just make the defense make as many decisions as you can so that they’re going to mess up at some point with all that ball movement and body movement and whatnot” (Curry).
As already mentioned in the introduction, I will now analyse Barcelona’s counterpressing. Yes, this article should mainly cover Barcelona’s in-possession phase, but their counterpressing was outstanding and it is also connected to the in-possession phase as the structure decides if the counterpressing is successful. Moreover, as Barcelona mostly wanted to have possession, their counterpressing was very important to immediately win the ball back.
“Without the ball, we are a disastrous team, a horrible team, so we need the ball.” (Guardiola)
The most important factor of Barcelona’s counterpressing was probably their structure. They always aimed to have small distances to each other. These small distances were a key part of their in-possession phase. As already mentioned, they used small distances to be able to make quicker combinations. Moreover, the different local overloads in possession also led to small distances to each other. This is a good starting point, but that’s not enough for a successful counterpressing. Let’s dive a little bit deeper.
“It’s about how you place yourself in relation to the others on the field when you have the ball and where you should be so that you can continue pressing when you lose it.” (Domènec Torrent)
@roshanrao_ on Twitter used an interesting approach on how to analyse the counterpressing from Manchester City here:
I will also use it a little bit to get a better understanding why Barcelona’s counterpressing was so good.
Basically, @roshanrao_ divides the structure around the counterpressing action into three zones:
“1. Zone of intervention — immediate engagement takes place on the ball
2. Zone of mutual help — support around the ball through numerical superiority
3. Zone of cooperation — Hold positions for width and depth” (@roshanrao_)
Let’s start with the first zone, the zone of intervention. This refers to immediately applying pressure on the ball-carrier after the ball is lost. Barcelona’s players instantly pressed the opponent after a ball loss with full pace. Mostly, the one or two nearest players would sprint towards the ball-carrier. Although, it wasn’t always about winning the ball back immediately. Sometimes, the presser ran through or looked to guide the opponent into a specific area.
Often it was just important to seemingly put the opponent under pressure even though the Barcelona player couldn’t win the ball back. This led to hesitation and often a mistake from the opponent.
Furthermore, it isn’t just important that immediate pressure is applied. The players also need to anticipate counterpressing actions quickly. The Barcelona players were masters at this. They constantly had in mind what would happen if the ball would be lost. Pressing triggers such as a Barcelona player with a bad body posture, a teammate under pressure or a great run from the opponent were signs to apply pressure. The Barcelona players would then slowly move over and backwards to be prepared for the counterpressing action but also for a potential counterattack from the opponent.
Secondly, the zone of mutual help. This refers to the players who position themselves around the ball to provide support and stability but at first don’t directly apply pressure. The occupation of this zones is very important as some teams can come through the zone of intervention. Players in the zone of mutual help can also act as a second wave.
At Barcelona, mostly around three or more players would occupy this zone. They looked to control the space around the ball by using the cover-shadow and often positioned themselves between the opponents. Also, the positioning on different vertical and horizontal lines helped to control the area.
Moreover, if Barcelona won the ball back, players in the zone of mutual help were often the first players who were seeked to play out of the congested area. Counterpressing actions are often very narrow and random. Having players positioned to get out of this space was also key.
Thirdly, the zone of cooperation refers to players who are positioned even further away. The aim of these players is to provide cover if the opponent can break through the first and second zone, e.g., with a long ball. Additionally, these players can also be outlet options after the ball is won from the counterpressing action.
This zone was usually occupied by the centre backs, the ball-far fullback and a midfielder to provide cover for a potential transition. Moreover, forwards would also be positioned in this zone to be the outlet and to transition forward after the ball was won back.
Sometimes, the structure wasn’t ideal or the opponent could play themselves out of the pressure. If this happened, usually the nearest player would still apply pressure and the other players would fall deep to provide cover.
This Barcelona side wasn’t just beautiful to watch, but also incredibly effective. Pep Guardiola brought the possession-based philosophy to the world of football and started an evolution. His Barcelona team was feared but also admired at the same time around the globe.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is the individual quality of this squad. Without these outstanding players, it wouldn’t be impossible to achieve all this. Though, it’s the role of the coach to fit them into a functioning and effective system. Pep Guardiola definitely established this and should therefore be respected.
I hope you enjoyed this article! It’s my first piece on Medium, so I wanted to make something special. Moreover, I hope that this article was detailed enough but not too long at the same time.

This season, FC Barcelona’s bold defensive strategy has been central to their reclaiming of the La Liga title. At the core of this approach is a high defensive line, meticulously orchestrated to stifle opposition progression. The visualization below plots Offsides Conceded against Opposition Progressive Passing Distance, placing Barça in a distinct and extreme corner of the graph as they conceded by far the most offsides while simultaneously allowing the least progressive passing distance. This is not a coincidence but in fact the natural outcome of one of the most aggressive defensive setups in world football.
Anchored by the positioning and anticipation of Iñigo Martínez and Pau Cubarsí, Barcelona’s high line compresses the pitch, forcing opponents into their own half and encouraging them to attempt risky balls over the top. The result is a flurry of offside calls as attackers struggle to time their runs behind a relentlessly disciplined back line. By stepping up with precision, Barça not only denies space but also disrupts rhythm, collapsing the time and room opponents need to construct meaningful attacks. Progressive passing distance, a key indicator of territorial gain, is dramatically reduced under this pressure.
Naturally, this strategy carries inherent risks. A high defensive line demands elite timing and communication, particularly from central defenders and the goalkeeper. When the long-term injury to first-choice keeper and captain Marc-André ter Stegen threatened the integrity of the system, manager Hansi Flick remained committed to his tactical principles. Emergency signing Wojciech Szczęsny rose to the occasion, helping the team secure an extraordinary 43 points from a possible 45 in the league. Even so, goalkeeping with so much space behind the defence inevitably invites moments of uncertainty, most memorably against Benfica, when Szczęsny collided with Alejandro Balde while charging out to intercept a ball played over the top.
When executed with the precision Barcelona have shown under Flick, the high line becomes a proactive defensive weapon. The high number of offsides conceded is not a sign of disorganisation, but a deliberate, repeatable outcome of a system designed to neutralise threats before they emerge. It is controlled through compression, and over the course of the season, it proved to be remarkably effective.

I realized a long time ago that our lives are like football teams. Everyone needs a good team to have a chance at success.
Ultimately, what brings success is diligence and tactics — a balanced and a realistic plan. Tonight, Barca had everything: a good team, diligence but fell short due to their half baked plan.
Nathaniel Bassey is simply saying;
""know when to go all out and when to be reserved"".
If your plan lacks balance and realism, it is half baked. What Barca did in the last minutes of normal time lacked reality.
In a football team, everyone needs to be diligent at their respective duties to have a shot at success. It is the duty of attackers to create and convert chances while the defenders tighten security and stop attacks.
This applies to reality as well. Your team — which can also be your circle of friends or social circle, needs people who can bring and take opportunities, as well as people who can protect from being extorted. You need someone who understands the game enough to devise plans that drive you forward, as well as people who share the same interest as yours to be dedicated to your course.
Every team needs a good manager (the tactician), an X factor in attack and defense, and the will to succeed:
Be cautious of the team you buildBe cautious of the relationships you keepBe cautious of the circle you keepBe cautious of your aspirations.

In a crowded café on Barcelona’s Plaza Molina, they chant his name, exuberant at the flash of magic. Waiters pound their metal trays on the counter, college students throw their arms in the air, and old men shake their heads in disbelief. Together they shout his name with abandon, over and over again. Messi! Messi! Messi! He’s done it again. On this night, the shining light of Barcelona football has created a moment of legend, the type of play that turns mortal players into a name that is chanted into the night.
I found this café by accident, wandering down the hillside from my flat in Putxet. Plaza Molina, a busy Metro stop, was not my destination. Typically, I strolled past the bustling square on my way into Gràcia, skipping the little restaurants on the border of the plaza filled with commuters and business people stopping for drinks on the way home.
But the lights of a small place on the corner caught my eye. My only goal was to find a place to watch the Barca match and have a beer. The café was small, but I spotted an empty stool at the cramped counter. Drowned by the sound of the announcers booming from the TV, I…

The day felt special for many reasons. Firstly, it was the first spring day warm enough to wear shorts outside. Coincidentally, this day happened to be the 23rd of April in Catalunya — otherwise known as Sant Jordi. The streets were filled with book stalls and flower stands, overwhelming the carrers of Barcelona with the smell of paper and roses.
Catalan flags were wrapped around every book stall, hung from balconies, and wrapped in ribbons around the singular roses that would soon be gifted to loved ones. Sant Jordi feels less like a festival for books — it’s a declaration of cultural Catalan pride.
A long time ago, there was a fearsome dragon that wreaked havoc on the inhabitants of a small village in Catalunya called Montblanc. In order to keep the dragon from destroying the village, the townspeople decided they would sacrifice one person every day through a lottery system.

By Vasco ValentimCreative at VBAT
For sixteen years now, OFFF takes place in Barcelona at the Museu de Disseny. It’s a platform where a vast variety of creatives share knowledge and experiences across all disciplines of Design. It’s where we go to drink and soak our creative souls.
Nowadays, OFFF is a creative hub and platform based in Barcelona with extensions all over the globe: Mexico City, Porto, Milan, New York City, you name it.
This year’s edition had an incredible line-up. From the holy Lance Wyman to legendary Vaughan Oliver, Imaginary Forces, Buck, or Vallée Duhamel, Annie Atkins, Stink Studios, Gary Baseman, Moving Brands, Anthony Burrill, Joshua Davis, and many many more.
The vibe and outside mood made it feel almost like a music summer festival.
Thursday I made sure to attend to Buck , a house of motion-graphics to be reckoned with. Here, the main venue had its biggest crowd of the day and it was completely justified. These guys are really solid and an inspiration. Just check the video below and you will know what I mean. Fascinating to learn how this short was created and realize that everything really starts with pen and paper.
Afterwards, it was Vaughan Oliver’s turn. I was looking forward to this one. Oliver was a delight to listen to — to learn how he created, back in the 80’s, together with the 4AD label, some of the incredible album covers for The Cocteau Twins, Breeders, Lush or Pixies. Looking back, as he said, he ended up doing what he loved most — designing covers of music albums, specially during that exciting post-punk period. His work is very recognizable — bold, vigorous, and ironic at times. Photography played a huge part in his work. He collaborated intensively with Chris Bigg throughout his golden days at 4AD, juxtaposing powerful imagery with puzzling blackmail lettering. Pure graphic design.
The crowd now was not as enthusiastic nor as full as with Buck; you could see that the young scene is not really familiar with Oliver, and I couldn’t help feeling bad for him. A great opportunity wasted out the window! Generation gap, I suppose.
The first day was coming to an end, and Imaginary Forces were the last speakers. These are the guys behind the hyped Stranger Things TV show main titles, Mad Men, Jessica Jones, Band of Brothers, Boardwalk Empire or Vinyl. Karen Fong and Michelle Dougherty were the speakers in charge.
Again it was interesting to see that even with the most mainstream media, everything starts with a piece of paper and a pencil.
It’s a very hands-on process, very intuitive and empiric some-how. For the Jessica Jones main titles sequence, for instance, they wanted to be true to the original covers of the comic books Jessica Jones: Alias, by David Mack, in which he uses watercolors profusely, something that became very iconic and popular among the fans. So, they started exploring ways of filming and portraying ink mixing with water, on glass or other media. The idea was to blend it eventually with actual footage.
Friday, was the day of Annie Atkins and Moving Brands.
“My name is Annie and I do graphic design for movies”.
That’s how Atkins introduced herself to the crowd. Annie is from Dublin and studied at Film School, only to realize that what she’s really passionate about is, actually, graphic design. Her first job was doing the graphic design for the 2007 Showtime The Tudors. She was working with the graphic design department on the show, and would create everything that you can think of: from patterns for tapestries, to medieval calligraphy on a wide variety of documents of the kingdom of Henry VIII.
The project was successful would lead to new opportunities and eventually she managed to work with directors like Steven Spielberg (on A Bridge of Spies) or Wes Anderson, on The Grand Budapest Hotel. Here her role as a graphic designer got to its higher, since she and her peers had to design virtually everything to the fictional Empire of Zubrowka. Documents, stamps, passports, telegrams, newspapers (!), maps, or other items, like packaging for pastries or even book covers. It was interesting to learn the difference between hero props and regular props, background props; some of these props are of course always in the background, out of sight, out of focus even, whilst when you have a hero prop, like the Mendl’s pastries box in The Grand Budapest Hotel, eventually you may get to have your piece shine in the silver screen for 2–3 seconds, in all it’s majestic glory.
In film, every item is unique and has to be replicated at least a dozen of times, so that, for instance, an actor can open an envelope (prop) on any given take and that this envelope is new and look the same, with its stamp and handwriting looking the same from a scene that possible did appear before in the film. Atkins loves her craft. She truly does.
Moving Brands turn was up next, with co-founder Jim Bull. Well known among us creatives, Moving Brands has offices across the globe. Originally from the North of England, Bull gave a non-apologetic talk, direct, honest and inspiring. Their work speak for themselves, so Jim was more interested in sharing mind-sets: sheepism, as he called it, is a terrible but avoidable tendency that ought to be stopped. We, as creatives that are responsible, must avoid sheepism at all costs, to follow hollow trends that lead to empty and fake brands that look like carbon copies of each others. Brands that in the end lack added value or recognition at all.
Saturday was the last day and I tried to make the most out of it. American illustrator and painter Gary Baseman, was interesting, unexpected, wild and crazy.
Anthony Burrill, gave a talked focused on typography and letterpress. Burrill shared is love for bold shapes, urban signs and symbols. To be passionate and honest about yourself and your work. He is the creator of the poster Work Hard & Be Nice to People, all set and printed manually, on a letterpress machine.
And lastly, Lance Wyman. Graduated from Pratt Institute in NYC, Wyman is regarded as one of the greatest, just like Paul Rand or Otl Aicher.
It’s incredible to think that Wyman was only 29 years old when he won the pitch for the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games. A time that brought him success, recognition and effectively launched his now long and vast career.
As he shared with us, at the time, he and his partner didn’t have enough money to get return tickets from Mexico, so they ended up staying there for a few years, leading up consequently to work on the Mexico City Metro visual identity as well, something that Wyman is very proud of, especially how such a complex premise could be simplified and systematized virtually using only a set of bold icons and colors — something still new at the time.
Wyman has transformed cities and public spaces across the world through the simple power of iconography. It is a reminder that often good design is timeless, pure, simple — and above all transversal and understandable to all cultures.

About a month after moving to Barcelona, I learned that one of my co-workers also lived there. I was ecstatic to meet another digital nomad in their 30s. The prospect of meeting someone I enjoyed working with for over a year was even more exciting. I couldn’t wait to see her!
I called a cab, and Uber directed me to Las Ramblas to wait. If you don’t already know this, Las Ramblas is known as “the World’s Most Pickpocketed Street.” I followed my usual precautions and stood with my back against a hotel wall.
As I waited, a gentleman approached. He was young, pulling a large suitcase as he walked toward the hotel’s grand entrance. The person next to him seemed to playfully snatch an item out of his hand. He turned around and grabbed the person by his shirt. They jumped into oncoming traffic to get away.
At first, I thought, “Look at these two fools in the street! They’re about to get hit by a car.”
But then I realized they weren’t friends. It wasn’t two guys roughhousing each other recklessly. One had just been robbed.
It was broad daylight: around 2 PM on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I couldn’t believe it.

It was Christmas time in Barcelona, and I was facing a creature I’d never encountered before: a log with a painted-on smiley face, wearing a Santa hat. This wasn’t Rudolph or Frosty; this was “Tio de Nadal,” and apparently, I was supposed to beat it with a stick. Welcome to Catalonia, right?
That’s how my adventure in Barcelona began — a whirlwind of cultural quirks, language barriers, and unexpected discoveries. My journey started when I followed my husband to his hometown, leaving behind my familiar life in Indonesia. I was a graphic designer by profession, but little did I know that this move would lead me down a new career path and spark a whole new set of passions.
My career started in the vibrant world of children’s publishing, where I worked as an art designer for a foreign magazine with a local editorial team in Indonesia. It was a fun and creative environment, but I soon felt the pull to explore new horizons. That led me to a graphic design and marketing promotion role for a real estate and hospitality company in a different city. This was my first taste of the marketing world, and I quickly realized I had a knack for it.
A few years later, I landed a position as a creative designer and digital marketer for a factory. This was where my fascination with the digital world truly blossomed. I was immersed in website design, social media campaigns, and the ever-evolving landscape of online marketing. And then came AI — the game-changer that sparked a whole new level of curiosity in me. I was hooked!

Learning a new language is like navigating a maze blindfolded. You bump into walls, take wrong turns, and occasionally stumble upon a hidden gem. That’s been my experience with Spanish and Catalan.
Despite my best efforts (and countless hours with Duolingo), my progress has been…let’s just say “gradual.” But I’ve learned to embrace the stumbles, the mispronounced words, and the occasional blank stares. It’s all part of the adventure.
The truth is, my attempts to speak Spanish often end up as a jumbled mix of Spanish, English, and even some Catalan thrown in for good measure. “Spanglish” with a Catalan twist, anyone? But hey, I’m learning, and that’s what matters.
Amidst the linguistic chaos, I found solace in a surprising place: Sashiko and embroidery. These intricate crafts, with their repetitive stitches and calming rhythms, became my refuge. They provided a sense of accomplishment and a way to connect with a new culture through its traditional art forms.
As an introvert, moving to a new city always presents a unique set of challenges. But trading the familiar hustle and bustle of Jakarta and Surabaya for the vibrant energy of Barcelona brought a new dimension to my introverted experience. While both Indonesia and Spain have their own brand of urban energy, the cultural shift and the unfamiliarity of my surroundings amplified my need for solitude. I found myself retreating into the comfort of our house, venturing out mostly for errands or when accompanied by my husband.
But here’s the thing: I didn’t feel lonely.
In fact, I discovered a newfound sense of fulfillment in my solitude. I filled my days with new hobbies, exploring the city at my own pace, and diving deeper into the digital world that fascinated me. I learned to embrace my introversion, finding joy in the quiet moments and the freedom to explore my own interests.
My journey in Barcelona has been a tapestry of unexpected turns, new passions, and personal growth. From accidental digital marketer to “Spanglish”-speaking crafter, I’ve embraced the challenges and discovered new facets of myself along the way. And while my introverted nature might keep me close to home most days, I’ve found a rhythm that works for me, a balance between solitude and connection, exploration and comfort.
I’m constantly learning and adapting, embracing the changes and challenges that come with living in a new country. And I’ve come to realize that the most rewarding part of this journey is not just the destination, but the process itself.
Looking back on my journey, I’ve learned a few valuable lessons:
I hope my story inspires you to embrace change, embrace your individuality, and pursue your passions, no matter where you find yourself in the world.

I like to participate in boutique-like forest trail ultras where there are only a handful of runners but last month I somehow managed to run the Zurich Barcelona Marathon with 16000+ runners signed up.
I usually don't care about my finishing time as any finished ultra is a success for me regardless of time. But now I ran a marathon distance with many other runners and this made me think about the end result.
I found this presentation of my result clean and simple but incredibly boring.
My finishing time was 3:31:44. I'm relatively happy with that time but I know that I got tired in the end. How did that compare to the people around me? How fast are the pro runners compared to me?
I decided to take all the results I could find and write a small program that would give me a more visual overview of the event.
First thoughts:
I also took a look into the finishing times and it seems that people who aimed under 3h and under 4h were pretty successful (no peak after the time in a graph) but it seems that a lot of runners with aim of 2h45min, 3h30min and 4h15min barely missed their mark.
The slower you are, the more you slow down in the second half of the race. People around the 4h finishing time were avg 10% slower in the 2nd half, that means a whopping 24min added.
And the race starts from the 25th km :) Almost everybody is able to hold the pace till 25th km but every next kilometre is getting harder to keep the pace.
Regardless of your results, it's amazing to see so many people running! We are all winners!

Each new trip announced by Celebrity sounds better than the last. Clearly the trip of a lifetime for many would be to spend some time in Rome, then cruise through the Greek Islands, and end up in Barcelona. That is the opportunity you will have if you book this incredible journey for ten days beginning in Rome on September 5, 2022. What makes it even better is this trip is on Celebrity’s newest ship BEYOND.
Now that alone sounds exciting, but add Celebrity has announced celebrating the BEYOND, and traveling with you, will be no less than Celebrity Cruises’ President and CEO, Lisa Lutoff-Perlo. Just imagine being on the ship with her, with Captain Kate McCue at the helm, and special host and Greece native, Captain Dimitrios Kafetzis, who will lead everyone on amazing tours throughout the sailing. It doesn’t get better than this.
This cruise gives regular Celebrity travelers a chance to reconnect with fellow Captain’s Club members meeting old friends and making new ones. There will be special events like a Santorini sail away with local entertainment, cuisine, and as usual in the Greek Islands one of the most beautiful sunsets in the world.
Now you begin your journey in Rome where you will meet the ship. If you are like me, you will want to spend a few days in Rome before you board. One can’t help love this Eternal City. The incredible Trevi fountain where you will throw a coin in to guarantee you will return again and again.
Then if you haven’t seen it before you must take this opportunity to embrace the power of Michelangelo’s vision at the truly inspiring Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. Then you board your ship on September 5th and take a walk around to start to appreciate its incredible beauty.
The excitement mounts for your visit to eight different ports. First Olympia, where the first Olympic Games were held in 776 B.C. Then among other exciting adventures discover the prehistoric Akrotiri ruins in Santorini, and enjoy the world-famous sunset while sipping some wine from a local vineyard. Hike to the spectacular Lindos Acropolis summit in Rhodes, and marvel at the Temple of Poseidon’s ancient glory in Athens. In Malta, admire the glittering baroque interior of St. John’s cathedral. Of course, no trip through the Greek Islands would be complete without a stop in beautiful Mykonos with its narrow white washed streets, my favorite Island, where I have spent many memorable vacations over the years.
Then while onboard this incredible newest of the Edge® Series ships, you can experience a signature restaurant by the renowned Chef Daniel Boulud (make your reservation early); the reimagined Grand Plaza inspired by the piazzas of Italy; a Rooftop Garden that extends out beyond the ship’s edge; and the new expanded two-tiered Sunset Bar. The Sunset Bar being one of my favorite places on any Celebrity ship.
You will be treated to great entertainment in the BEYOND’s theater which surpasses all other ships with its state-of-the-art technology. Then you end your cruise in the exciting city of Barcelona and what could be better than that?
I have been told by friends who took BEYOND’s maiden cruise that once onboard you will understand what Celebrity has said; this ship was designed to change the way you experience the world. Even the incredible artwork on board is worth the trip.
So look at your calendar. It you have the time, or can make the time, get in touch with Celebrity or better yet my travel agent Scott Moster, an expert on Celebrity and all cruises, at scott@myluxcruise.com; and book this exciting cruise today.

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

Collection of reflections and experiences aimed at reimagining our society from an economic, social and environmental point of view

I have been to Barcelona several times, but since the last time it had been 10 years now.
A period in which the city experienced great transformations, socially and aesthetically speaking, related to urban regeneration. Fruit of the work of one mayor in particular, Ada Colau, a “grassroots” activist who brought a breath of new air to the city, and of many other figures who believed in positive change for local communities.
For work reasons, I was in Barcelona for a couple of days, and I took the opportunity for a “regeneration tour” in 24 hours, to understand what has changed in the city and what has unfortunately or fortunately remained the same over time.
I walk out of the hotel in Poblenou where I was staying and already I feel happy. In front of me trees and bushes hide the concrete. No horns or engine noise nearby, just the sound of Barcelona’s typical green parrots. The impact that noise pollution has on us becomes much clearer in these moments, yet we struggle to notice it in our daily lives. I keep walking, imagining what the city would be like if it were full of spaces like this, and what all cities would be like if the gray palette of urbanism…

Earlier this month, one of the main football agreements in recent decades was made official. Leading brands in their fields of activity, Barcelona and Spotify closed a medium/long-term partnership, which promises to take the relationship between sport and entertainment to another level.To understand this business in greater depth, we first need to understand what led each of us to get here.
Spotify is a music streaming company, founded in 2006 in Sweden. At the time, people basically had two options for listening to their favorite songs digitally: paying for each one (iTunes model), or pirating with platforms like Napster.
The company, which was only officially launched two years later, emerged as a viable option between these two options, with a business model based on offering a “freemium” service (see below), and thus gained a very popular user base. large, obviously much more because of the “free” part than the “premium” part.
In the same year of release (2008) Spotify sold around 19% of its stakes to major record labels (Sony, Universal, Warner and EMI) as licensing agreements for their music. Ten years later, it went public on the New York Stock Exchange, valued at US$ 26.5 billion, and months later saw the record companies sell their shares, with the exception of Sony, which still kept half of it, and Universal, which still holds the same stake (today both have, together, something around 6% to 7% of the Swedish company). Read more about Spotify’s ownership structure here.
At the end of the same year, it launched its services in countries in the Middle East and North Africa and in 2019, two important news came: for the first time, the company was profitable, and it announced a change in strategy and positioning.
From then on, it would become a company focused on audio, rather than just music. From there, we saw a series of actions by Spotify in an attempt to expand its operations via the podcast market, buying from two start-ups in the sector, Gimlet Media and Anchor.
In 2020, it acquired exclusivity via licensing agreement for the most famous podcast on the platform, the controversial The Joe Rogan Experience (video below), for US$ 100 million (which was later reported to have been for double the value), in addition to signing partnerships with influencer Kim Kardashian, and with DC Comics. Investment in the audio sector lasts until today, and even expands into the audiobook business.
This diversification/expansion of operations makes even more sense when we understand a little more about the margin that each “product” offers Spotify.
A part of the business model, mentioned briefly at the beginning of the text, is based on a complex formula for paying royalties to record companies and artists (Read more here). Many of the singers complain that they are paid much less than they should (Spotify has gained great bargaining power), and they show great dissatisfaction. The singer Taylor Swift even removed her songs from the platform in 2014 as a form of protest.
It is stipulated, however, that 70% of the earnings that the company has with its music, is passed on to the record companies, which in turn, are responsible for paying the artists (Spotify recently even created an institutional website, Loud & Clear , with very interesting information on revenue generation and transfer of these). When someone listens to a podcast like Joe Rogan’s, the company appropriates all the money.
Today the company is the leader in its field, with 31% of the market share of the global music streaming market (graph below), according to MIDiA Research, a company that conducts research and analysis of digital markets in its survey for the second quarter. of 2021.
Despite being consolidated at the top, Spotify saw its share percentage drop compared to the same period in recent years: 33% in 2020 and 34% in 2019. At the same time, it is beginning to see the growth of Amazon Music, a service offered within from Amazon’s Video Bundle, and from YouTube Music. The study points out that the latter:
“It particularly resonates with Gen Z and younger Millennials, which should set alarm bells ringing for Spotify as its core subscriber base of 2010s Millennials in the West is starting to age.”
In 2021, Spotify implemented a price increase for several plans worldwide, including in Brazil, which may indicate, once again, an attempt to increase its margins, even with the number of users growing every quarter. Currently, according to the last report published, Spotify has 406 million active monthly users (between free and premium accounts), with a forecast that would reach 418 million in the first quarter of this year.
Within this context, Spotify started approaching football a few years ago, starting with partnerships with clubs that now have official profiles on the platform, and making playlists created by their players available. This was the case with clubs in Brazil, such as Palmeiras, the first in the country to have a profile on the platform, São Paulo and Santos. Boca Juniors also closed with the company (video below) in 2019. All these agreements, inclusive, were between 2016 and 2019.
On the other hand, in recent years Barcelona has been in a delicate economic situation. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers got so much worse, to the point that the former CEO, Ferran Reverter, declared that if the club had been a limited company, it could have gone bankrupt in early 2021.In addition to having lower revenues (mainly related to its Stadium, photo below), Barcelona broke the record of spending in its history: €1.13 billion. €112 were invested in the development of Espai Barça (project to modernize and renovate the Camp Nou and its surroundings), in addition to other “extraordinary expenses”.
As a consequence, the Catalan club released its accounts for the 2020/21 season with a deficit of €481 million. Projected revenue for the current season, meanwhile, was approved at 765 million, up 21.2% from past earnings.
Within these contexts, Barcelona and Spotify seem to have found in each other possibilities to solve their (current and future) problems. Spotify will be Barcelona’s sponsor and the club’s official Audio Streaming partner. The agreement, valid from July this year, basically involves four fronts:
The first point refers to the sponsorship of the game uniforms of the men’s and women’s professional football teams (until 2025/26), which, according to the Mundo Deportivo portal, will be €57.5 million (R$292.5 million). Which will keep Barcelona as the third club that earns with sponsorship in their kit (graphic below). Spotify will also print the training shirts of the two teams, and of the Catalan football schools, the Barça Academy Pro, until 2024/25, for another €5 million (R$ 25.4 million).
Now, Spotify takes over as the club’s sole football sponsor, replacing three other companies. Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce company, paid something around €55m to €60m (this last season, the amounts dropped to between €30m and €35m due to the effects of the pandemic) to stamp the center of the shirt. of the men’s team.
Beko, the home appliance company, paid €19m to appear on the sleeves of the game’s uniform and training shirt. With the pandemic, Beko renegotiated the contract to reduce the payment to between €12 and €10 million, giving up space in the sleeves.
Stanley Black & Decker, an industrial and domestic tools company, has been the official shirt sponsor of the women’s team since 2018, and paid €3 million per season.
The agreement also involves the sponsorship of naming rights for the stadium, which will be divided into two stages: 1) while the modernization of Espai Barça lasts and 2) another long-term agreement after the completion of the renovation of Camp Nou, which will be renamed Spotify. Camp Nou (pictured below) from the middle of this year. The Swedish company will also have its brand present in other locations in the stadium.
Also according to Mundo Deportivo, this will be a €5 million deal for the first six seasons, with the possibility of renewal for another 15 years for between €15m and €20m for each of them.
The approval of the Espai Barça project took place at the end of last year, coincidence or not, two years after the Santiago Bernabéu modernization project. The works should be completed by the end of 2027, but the Camp Nou stadium is expected to be completed two years earlier, as shown in an official statement from the club. The expected expenditure is €1.5 billion.
Hoping that the alliance with Spotify will make the project “transform the facilities and surroundings of the stadium into a new world-class entertainment experience open to the city of Barcelona”, Barcelona intends to fund it with events that do not involve football matches (see chart below). In a dossier (very detailed, by the way) released by Barça, 63% of projected revenues will come from hospitality, sponsorship and naming rights, and from meetings and events.
The third part of the agreement involves advertising assets at Spotify Camp Nou and Estadio Johan Cruyff (where the women’s and men’s football teams play), on billboards, press room, mixed zone, among others.
Finally, the partnership also includes experiences and the presence of audiovisual content, hospitality packages (remember the graphic above?) and “Barça experiences”.
A deal of this magnitude represents a step forward for sportainment. This business is the biggest one involving sports and music (although we have other important ones, as shown in Jay-Z’s relationship with football). With this panorama, we can analyze even more possible advantages for each one of those involved.
Regarding branding, the first aspect that is evident is the reinforcement of the global character that the brands achieved in this co-branding, as evidenced in the official announcement:
“The collaboration with Spotify also marks the Club’s strategic objective to proactively seek partners who share the values and philosophy that define its brand and, at the same time, allow it to maintain its status as a global reference, within and off the field, in an increasingly competitive environment”
While Barcelona on its main social networks has more than 260 million followers (only on official accounts in Spanish), Spotify, as shown above, has more than 400 million active users and has been expanding its operations.
Remember the Midia Research study, which said that Spotify’s main user base in the West was “starting to age”? So let’s go to the last part of the company’s announcement:
“Barcelona have legions of young fans all over the world — in fact, the majority of Barça fans are under 30, which is an extremely important audience for Spotify. These fans also reside in some of Spotify’s fastest growing markets, including India, Latin America and Indonesia.”
Still in these numbers, what may have been the main factor of this agreement is data sharing. Both can use each other’s database to get to know the consumption habits of fans/users and improve their products and also seek cross-selling. This can happen, for example, through geo-location, as exemplified by Spotify itself:
“Spotify is working with Barça to leverage our access to elements within the stadium to promote artists and enable discovery. For example, using dynamic digital displays to showcase and geographically target artists relevant to Barça’s global TV audience. While viewers in Europe might see a message about an artist, viewers in India might get a different and locally relevant message.”
In terms of management, both would now also become an entertainment hub. Spotify has the possibility of no longer being restricted to the digital realm, but now, it can “tangibilize” its experiences in one of the main tourist cities in Europe by having the physical space of Camp Nou and its surroundings at your disposal. It is possible that we will see the Swedish company promoting launches, events or even producing shows themselves.
It is conceivable that Spotify follows the line of “original productions”, as Netflix and Amazon do, and becomes the owner (as in the case of Joe Rogan’s podcast) and content producer, which would increase its profit margin and would also be a differential in relation to its competitors.
Barcelona also benefits from this, because it will likely have secondary financial gains by taking a share in the revenues of possible future concerts organized in their stadium. Furthermore, the use of Camp Nou (pictured below) would not only be limited during the game season, but throughout the entire year, which would generate recurring revenue for a longer period of time.
This, without counting, of course, the immediate financial gain that the culés will have. Adding all the amounts together, the first years of the agreement will give the club around €67.5 million (playing and training uniform and naming rights), which represents 10.7% of its revenues from last season.
Complex and multi-factorial, the partnership between Barcelona and Spotify is very promising and, as seen here, very, very coherent.

As I explored in my assessment of Barcelona’s recent victory over Sevilla, there are signs that Xavi Hernández is doing more than just getting good results. He’s moulding a very accomplished footballing system.
But recently, not everything has been rosy in the era of #XaviBall. After a laborious draw against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, and a narrow victory against Levante that Barca had no right to win, it’s clear that the side is still in its juvenile phase at best.
In particular, it’s suffered against a specific shape and play style. After some analysis, it appears no coincidence that Barca struggles when the opposition plays five defenders.
So having watched some games back, with a keen eye on the tactical nuances, I’ve listed a few key reasons why 5 is an unlucky number for Xavi’s Barcelona.
1.The numerical advantage is lost in buildup
Building up from the goalkeeper, Barcelona have consistently used a 2–3–5 setup. Both full backs go wide, the attacking midfielders are high up the pitch, and the wingers stay wide on either flank. The goal is to make the pitch big, stretch the opposition, and ultimately create space in the wide areas.
Because of the positions of the attacking midfielders, the opposing back four must stay compact. By moving the ball from side to side, Barca can easily find a full back or winger with plenty of space.
And with the centre forward occupying two centre backs, Barca have a free man when the opponents press aggressively.
A back five changes everything
However, when the opposition plays a back five, or three, the man advantage is lost. All of the front players are man-marked, plus the attacking midfielders. Here against Levante, you can see every player, bar the keeper, is accounted for.
Eintracht Frankfurt used a similar idea. But instead of man marking everywhere, they conceded the numerical advantage in the first third of the pitch in order to create their own advantage in the zone Barca loves to attack most: out wide.
The consistent problem here is that the back line cannot be stretched.
With five players defending, both wingers can be marked tightly regardless of where the ball is. No matter how much Barca move the ball looking for space, it will very rarely appear on the flanks.
So how should Barca play out from these scenarios? The answer leads us on to the next problem.
2. Barca’s forwards struggle to hold up the ball
When passing lanes are blocked and the wide players are marked, the emphasis must shift to the centre of the pitch. The most direct solution is to use a ‘third man run’.
This means finding the attacking midfielders indirectly, by going through the centre forward.
The image above is the ideal scenario. Aubameyang makes a run deep and has Pedri in support, who has also peeled off his marker — one of the centre backs. This is the benefit of having the attacking midfielders high and wide.
The theory is easy, the execution not so much. And Aubameyang has been having a torrid time recently trying to hold the ball up.
Unfortunately, neither Dembélé or Ferran Torres are particularly adept at doing this either (á la Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane). This makes a man-for-man approach very appealing for the opposition.
To summarise so far: a back five nullifies Plan A (to create space out wide), and forces Plan B (go direct into the forwards), which simply hasn’t been fruitful. And perhaps not suited to the current personnel.
So what’s Plan C? Well, here’s the third problem:
3. The system is too rigid
Or, in other words, there is no Plan C. And that’s understandable.
Xavi has modernised the way Barcelona play. It’s not an understatement, after the mediocrity of several managers (that won’t be named), to say that players have had to ‘re-learn’ the game. At least with regards to understanding positioning and movement.
With that in mind, and with the players taking on a new system, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they haven’t yet mastered the next stage: improvisation.
Because improvisation is key when Plan A and B don’t work. That, and a lot of quality.
I’m talking particularly about fluidity of role and movement. Manchester City are the kings of this. Despite having a very defined idea of how to attack, the players interchange positions and responsibilities effortlessly.
We got a glimpse of this in the second half against Levante, as Gavi and Pedri came on and introduced an element of unpredictability. Especially the former, who did something no other midfielder had even attempted: dribble past his marker.
This characteristic, fluidity, should quite naturally mature and evolve with time. It’s reasonable that this is a work in progress.
However, my final point is perhaps more concerning. Especially in the face of some big games before the end of the season:
4. Nobody is marking the wingbacks
If there’s one flaw that everyone has realised, it’s that Barca’s biggest weakness is their defensive transition.
Two of the reasons for this have been touched on already:
The first: the loss of possession through the centre forward. With wingers high and wide, and attacking midfielders supporting, Barca can be very short on numbers in transition. Busquets and Pique become especially exposed due to their lack of pace.
The second: Jordi Alba drifts wide. Usually, Barcelona try to prevent counter-attacks with a 2–3 shape that remains behind the ball. But when Jordi Alba, the leftmost of the ‘3’ breaks beyond the ball, this shape is broken and opposing forwards exploit the space.
The third reason is specific to the five-man backline. You can see it materialising in the image above, in the bottom right corner of the image. It’s the opposition wingback.
Against Frankfurt especially, it was clear Barca’s wingers were not instructed to track back. With the entire backline occupied by forwards, these marauding wingbacks created overloads time and again.
It was the same story against Levante, who should have made much more of their numerous overloads.
And so while Barcelona and Xavi have spent much of these first few months tweaking the offensive setup, more caution will need to be paid to this type of counter attack. Fortunately, the tactical solution seems easy enough: players work harder to get back.
Whether anything more can be done about it (aside from making tactical fouls) remains to be seen.
Despite everything I’ve highlighted, things still look overwhelmingly positive for Barcelona. The speed in which Xavi has implemented his system, and the players have understood it, is credit to his coaching ability.
However, this project is still a work-in-progress. Come the summer, personnel will change, the squad will look different, and things will evolve again. Whether Xavi can fix these problems problems immediately will be a big test of his managerial prowess. But based on his record so far, I wouldn’t bet against him.
If you enjoy these tactical analyses, please give a ‘clap’ and follow the page!

Greetings, football enthusiasts! Today, I’m taking you on a timeless journey through one of FC Barcelona’s unforgettable nights. Join me to discover the magic that unfolded in the clash against Chelsea (2009), a night engraved in the annals of football history.
“Each second felt like an eternity”
The story begins in a hub of pure excitement. Chelsea already led 1-0, and Barça faced a mountain to climb. At that time, as a 12-year-old schoolboy, I returned from school with indescribable excitement. I couldn’t wait to see how my heroes would tackle this colossal challenge.
I remember sticking to the TV, still wearing my school uniform, eagerly anticipating the spectacle. It was more than just a match for me; it was an immersive experience, a magical interlude in my adolescence.
As the match progressed, stress mounted. Every whistle, every pause in play, everything seemed to decide Barça’s fate. My heart raced; each second felt like an eternity.
Then came the 93rd minute, a moment etched in my mind. Andrés Iniesta, the football genius, triggered an explosion of emotions. I remember leaping with joy, unable to contain the excitement. It was a moment of deliverance, where football transcended the sport to become a pure emotional experience.
Let’s be honest—beyond the scoreboard, there were refereeing decisions that could have altered the narrative. As a fan, I couldn’t help but acknowledge the whims of fate. Football, with its imperfections, added to the drama of that unforgettable night.
Ultimately, beyond the scoreboard, it was a fan’s journey—a roller coaster of emotions, from doubt to belief, from anxiety to jubilation. Join me next time to relive other unforgettable football moments.
Don’t forget to subscribe, and share your own stories in the comments. Until next time, keep the football spirit alive!
This is Stanley,

Barcelona was never on my radar as a place to visit, let alone move to. In 2024, nearly 12 million tourists visited this city, which is now my home. After four and a half years as a resident, I’ve seen its good and its bad, but moving here has still been my best big life decision, and I’ve made more than my fair share of bad ones.
Before you question, “I wonder what it’s like to be an American expat living in Barcelona,” let me make something perfectly clear. I identify as an immigrant. Expats, in my opinion, have large sums of disposable income, something I do not have.
My decision to move here had nothing to do with its beautiful architecture, fabulous food, and comfortable climate. I moved here because, while visiting Tuva, a small Siberian republic in the Russian Federation that shares a border with Mongolia, for a third time, I met a woman there who happened to live in Barcelona. What started as a friendship turned into a romance, and after several visits to see her, I took the dive into the deep end of the pool and eventually moved here permanently.
Anything worth doing usually has a few bumps in the road, and my decision to move to Barcelona was hit with a huge one. Three days before my flight from New York to Barcelona, the pandemic shut the world’s borders…

How I Learned to Blend in With Locals in Barcelona: Tips from a Grateful Foreigner,https://medium.com/@ntrntlf/how-i-learned-to-blend-in-with-locals-in-barcelona-tips-from-a-grateful-foreigner-1b506ab6472f,"Sign up

When I first arrived in Barcelona, I was wide-eyed and clumsy — like a tourist trying too hard not to look like one. I’d been dreaming of Gaudí facades, sangria by the beach, and a Mediterranean lifestyle full of late dinners and even later conversations. What I didn’t anticipate was how long it would take to actually feel like I belonged.
Here’s what I learned — sometimes the hard way — about blending in with locals in this magnetic, complex city.
1. Start with “Bon dia,” not “Hola”
I knew Spanish (Castellano), but I quickly discovered that Catalan is everywhere — on street signs, in supermarkets, and yes, in everyday greetings. Saying bon dia (good morning) instead of hola showed respect for the local culture. No one expected me to be fluent in Catalan, but trying a few words — si us plau (please), gràcies (thank you) — opened a lot of doors, literally and figuratively.
Tip: Download a basic Catalan phrasebook or app. Just trying a few phrases goes a long way.
2. Eat when they eat, not when you’re hungry
I once sat down for dinner at 7:00 PM and got a confused look from the waiter. In Barcelona, lunch is at 2 PM, and dinner doesn’t start until at least 9 PM. Adapting to this schedule was challenging at first (especially with my American stomach), but it helped me sync with the rhythm of the city.
Tip: Join the menú del día (menu of the day) crowd at lunchtime. It’s affordable, filling, and a great way to observe locals in their natural habitat.
3. Dress the part, subtly
Barcelona style is chic but effortless. Locals somehow make sneakers look elegant and never seem overdressed or underdressed. I learned the hard way when I showed up to a casual dinner in flip-flops and got side-eyes from every direction.
Tip: Leave the touristy sandals and loud prints at home. A well-fitted tee, stylish sneakers, and a light jacket can help you blend in instantly.
4. Embrace vermouth culture
I didn’t expect vermouth to become part of my weekend ritual, but “fer el vermut” (having a vermouth) before lunch on weekends is a sacred tradition. It’s not about getting tipsy — it’s about slowing down, snacking on olives, and chatting with friends for hours.
Tip: Go to a neighborhood bodega on a Sunday around noon. Order a vermut negre and some anchovies. Just sit, sip, and soak it in.
5. Avoid La Rambla — except at 5 a.m.
Everyone goes to La Rambla once. But locals? They avoid it like the plague — unless they’re walking home after a night out. If you want to see the real Barcelona, head to neighborhoods like Gràcia, Sant Antoni, or Poblenou.
Tip: Wander into the smaller plazas at night. You’ll find kids playing soccer, couples drinking wine on benches, and old men arguing about Barça. That’s the magic.
6. Be a regular
One of the best decisions I made was committing to a local café. I went every day, even if it was just for a cortado. Eventually, the barista started greeting me by name, and I was invited to a neighborhood calçotada (a Catalan barbecue). That’s when I knew I was more than just a visitor.
Tip: Pick a small bar, café, or shop near where you live. Consistency breeds community.
7. Understand the pride — and pain — of Catalan identity
Conversations about identity, politics, and language run deep here. I learned early on not to assume Spain = Catalonia. People here have a distinct sense of self, and respecting that nuance showed I wasn’t just another tourist trying to “do Spain in a week.”
Tip: Listen more than you talk. Ask questions, and stay curious. You’ll gain trust.
Final Thoughts
Blending in doesn’t mean pretending to be local — it means respecting the flow, showing genuine interest, and participating instead of spectating. Barcelona rewards patience and presence. It taught me to slow down, look around, and become part of the scenery.
I came to Barcelona with a suitcase and a guidebook. I stayed because of the people who welcomed me when I finally stopped trying so hard — and just started being.

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
I am on my way to the airport as I started writing this.
A few days ago, I flew to Spain to begin the first leg of my solo trip around Europe. There’s no deeper reason why I’m taking this trip except I know that, whatever the outcome is, I need to do it and it will reveal its beautiful purpose in time.
It’s too early to write my reflections about my experience, and there is definitely so much to be written. But, I’m about to fly out of Spain today to my next destination, and I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by the kindness around me, especially that I am far from home.
From that metro guy who brought out his phone to use Google Translate so he could better give me instructions,
that other passenger who help me carry my luggage upstairs because I didn’t know you can go around and maybe find a lift,
that guy from Albania on a holiday who walked me to the bus stop ‘coz I’ve been literally going circles, looking for my ride to my hostel,
that guy from Germany, who was also on a holiday, but who explained the route of the bus I took to assure me and who also made suggestions on what touristy things I should do,
my roommates from Egypt, Brazil, and Chile who already feel like long-time friends, offering help and suggesting to meet up again in my next destinations,
Viki from Hungary, who provided me company on my first day, sharing stories as well as the same love for sports and dogs,
Mary Margaret from the US, who helped me book a tour and let me pay her in cash because my card wouldn’t work for online purchases because of its registered local number,
Miquel, a true blue Catalan from Esparreguera who adjusted his sched so I could go hiking in Montserrat — the reason why I added Barcelona to this trip,
all the fellow tourists and travelers who offered to take my photo (regardless if they turned out good shots or not) because I was alone,
the Spanish girl who lives near my hostel who taught me the best way to the airport,
David, a guy from Slovenia who works at the hostel, who gleefully (but not sure if legally) offered to keep my luggage and carry-on bag at the storage room free of charge for two days,
the ladies at the buses and the metro who weren’t articulate in English but still entertained my questions and went out of their way so we could find the lift for my heavy luggage,
the guy on the wheelchair, who was, of course, an expert to accessing the elevators, who kept on reminding me not to ride the train that runs through the same line as the train to the airport,
the Spanish girl who sat closer to my luggage at the airport terminal when I had to leave and check my flight details on the screen, and who then told me where to find assistance.
I have been just less than a week away, and I have many people to thank for — especially my family. But let me start with these strangers. I hope I got to know all their names and keep communication, but it warms my heart to think that even strangers can play magical cameos in anyone’s life.
When I arrived in Spain, I knew that getting lost should be enjoyed just as much as getting to one’s destination in a breeze. And true enough, I got lost, I doubted my direction and decisions multiple times, but I survive, learning lessons and making memories.
I am about to leave Spain, convinced that the world is beautiful. Yes, because Barcelona and Catalonia are a sight to behold. But more so, because of the kindness all around us.

Barcelona is a city I visited without many expectations, but I saw how wrong I was. Before the trip, my knowledge was limited only something such as urban planning, building structures, big Gaudi’s structures, football club and generic things. But after spending three days there, I felt like I could actually live in Barcelona.
I want to share my experience and what I learned when I walked through the city. There are still some places I couldn’t visit; unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time. In this writing, I shared only some places that I went.
First, I gave a 3-day trip itinerary. Then, I explained each place in detail, organized by category.
Start your journey in the heart of the old city, dive into Gothic architecture.
Explore the green side of Barcelona with views, art, and calm spaces, plus a beautiful evening at the beach.
Today is all about imagination, emotion, and big symbols of Barcelona’s identity.
I organized my trip into the following categories:
🏰 Historical & Architectural Landmarks
1.Baslica de la Sagrada Famlia
The Basílica de la Sagrada Família is one of the most iconic landmarks in Barcelona and the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world. Designed by Antoni Gaudí, it looks like something out of a fairytale with its towering spires and intricate facades. Construction began back in 1882 and is still ongoing today.
Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect born in 1852 in Catalonia. He studied architecture in Barcelona and became known for his innovative use of materials and structures. Gaudí worked on several major projects, including Park Güell, Casa Batlló, and the Sagrada Família, which he focused on from 1883 until his death in 1926.
Gaudí didn’t start the Sagrada Família project himself — it was already planned as a Catholic church by a local organization called the Spiritual Association of Devotees of Saint Joseph. They wanted to build a church dedicated to the Holy Family (Sagrada Família) to promote Christian values in response to the rise of secularism.
Gaudí took over the project in 1883, after the original architect resigned. He saw it as a chance to combine his deep Catholic faith with architecture. For Gaudí, the church wasn’t just a building — it was a way to tell the story of Christianity through art, structure, and symbolism. He dedicated the last 40 years of his life to it, turning it into his life’s mission.
If you want to see the inside, it’s best to buy your ticket at least a week in advance.
2. Baslica de Santa Maria del Mar
The Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar is a beautiful Gothic church built in the 1300s by local sailors and merchants. It feels peaceful and grand inside, with tall stone columns and soft natural light. Tucked in the heart of El Born, it’s a quiet gem full of history and charm.
3. Baslica de Santa Maria del Pi
The Basílica de Santa Maria del Pi was built in the early 1300s and finished around 1391. It’s a quiet Gothic church in the middle of the old town, named after a pine tree that once grew nearby. With its tall bell tower and simple stone walls, it’s a peaceful place to rest and enjoy a bit of history.
Both churches were built in the 1300s and look Gothic, but they feel different inside. Santa Maria del Mar is brighter and more open, while Santa Maria del Pi feels stronger and a bit darker.
4. Cathedral of Barcelona
The Cathedral of Barcelona, also called the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia, was built between the 13th and 15th centuries. It’s a grand Gothic church with tall spires, stone carvings, and a peaceful cloister inside. Right outside is Plaça de la Seu, a lovely square where people often sit, watch street performers, or take photos of the cathedral’s front.
5. Palau Reial Major
The Palau Reial Major was the royal palace of the counts of Barcelona and later the kings of Aragon. It was mainly built between the 13th and 15th centuries and sits in the Gothic Quarter. Today, you can explore its old stone halls and the Plaça del Rei in front, a quiet square that feels full of medieval history.
In this narrow area, I felt a deeper connection to history.
6. Palau de la Generalitat
The Palau de la Generalitat is the seat of the Catalan government and has been used for that purpose since the 1400s. It has a mix of Gothic and Renaissance styles and is still a working government building today. You’ll find it on Plaça de Sant Jaume, right across from the City Hall.
In the square in front of this building we saw an old man talking about how much damage tourists were doing to Barcelona.
We saw a “tourists go home” protest in Barcelona. However, a touristic environment was created throughout the city and apart from this person, I did not see any attitude towards tourists; on the contrary, everyone was very interested.
7. Barcelona City Hall
Barcelona City Hall, also known as Casa de la Ciutat, has been the city’s main government building since the 14th century. Its front mixes Gothic and Neoclassical styles, showing how the city changed over time. It faces the Palau de la Generalitat on Plaça de Sant Jaume, a square full of history and political life.
8. Casa Batlló
Casa Batlló is one of Antoni Gaudí’s most famous works, designed in 1904. The building looks like something from a dream, with colorful tiles, flowing shapes, and a roof that looks like a dragon’s back. It’s on Passeig de Gràcia and often called the “House of Bones” because of its bone-like balconies and windows.
9. La Pedrera — Casa Milà
La Pedrera, also known as Casa Milà, was designed by Antoni Gaudí and finished in 1912. Its wavy stone façade and twisted iron balconies make it look like a moving piece of art. The rooftop, with its strange chimney shapes, is one of the most unique spots in Barcelona.
As I saw these works of Gaudi, they changed my perception a lot as they differed from other works of art.
10. Monument als Castellers
The Monument als Castellers represents the traditional Catalan practice of building human towers, called castells. These towers are made by people standing on each other’s shoulders, sometimes reaching up to 10 levels high. The sculpture shows the strength, teamwork, and trust needed to create these towers — core values of Catalan culture.
11. The World Comes To Life With Each Kiss
The mural “The World Begins With Every Kiss” (El món neix en cada besada) symbolizes love, freedom, and unity. Created in 2014 by photographer Joan Fontcuberta and ceramist Antoni Cumella, it commemorates the 300th anniversary of Barcelona’s fall during the War of the Spanish Succession. The artwork comprises 4,000 ceramic tiles, each featuring photographs submitted by citizens depicting personal moments of freedom. Together, these images form a mosaic of two people kissing, representing the enduring spirit of love and resilience in the face of adversity.
A nice area to take photos.
12. Camp Nou
The Camp Nou is FC Barcelona’s iconic stadium, originally opened on September 24, 1957. Camp Nou, FC Barcelona’s iconic stadium, is currently undergoing major renovations to expand its capacity to 105,000 and modernize its facilities.
I think they design great museums to introduce their teams. Additionally, it was amazing to see the Champions League trophy with my own eyes.
🏞️ Parks, Viewpoints & Nature
13. Montjuc & Montjuïc Castle
Montjuïc became a key part of Barcelona’s growth and global image in the 20th century. Many of its buildings and spaces were first developed for the 1929 International Exposition, a world fair that helped show off the city’s culture and progress. Later, in 1992, the area was transformed again to host the Summer Olympic Games, bringing new life to old buildings and adding new sports facilities.
Today, Montjuïc is a mix of history, art, and nature. You can visit the Montjuïc Castle, explore museums like the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC), walk through peaceful gardens, or watch the light show at the Magic Fountain. It’s a place where locals and visitors come to relax, learn, and enjoy some of the best views in the city.
14. Plaça de les Cascades
Plaça de les Cascades is a beautiful square in Barcelona, located just below the National Art Museum of Catalonia on Montjuïc Hill. Built for the 1929 International Exposition, it features a series of cascading fountains that lead up to the museum, creating a stunning visual effect. The square is a popular spot for visitors to relax and enjoy the views of the city.
15. Ciutadella Park
Ciutadella Park is one of the most loved green spaces in Barcelona, perfect for relaxing, walking, or enjoying a boat ride on the lake. It was once a military area but turned into a public park in the 1800s. On weekends, the park comes alive with events, music, and people dancing near the big fountain.
It easily ranks in my top 5 favorites.
16. Park Güell
Park Güell is a colourful and imaginative park designed by Antoni Gaudí, built between 1900 and 1914. Originally planned as a housing development, it became a public park filled with winding paths, mosaic-covered benches, and playful architecture. Today, it’s one of Barcelona’s most iconic spots and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It costs 18 euros, but totally worth it.
17. Barceloneta Beach — Playa de la Barceloneta
Barceloneta Beach is one of Barcelona’s most famous and lively beaches, located in the old fishing neighborhood of La Barceloneta. It was transformed in the early 1990s for the Olympic Games, turning into a wide, sandy beach with a long promenade. Today, it’s a favorite spot for sunbathing, swimming, beach volleyball, and enjoying fresh seafood at the nearby chiringuitos. The beach is also known for its vibrant atmosphere, with street performers, music, and people dancing along the promenade, especially in the evenings.
PERFECT!!!
It was full even though we didn’t go swimming. I can’t imagine summer.
🖼️ Museums & Cultural Sites
18. Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya
The Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC) was built for the 1929 International Exposition to show off Catalan culture and art. It’s located in the Palau Nacional on Montjuïc Hill, a grand building that became the perfect home for a national museum. Today, it holds one of the best collections of Romanesque art in the world, along with Gothic, Renaissance, and modern works.
⛲ Monuments & Squares
19. Plaça d’Espanya
Plaça d’Espanya is one of Barcelona’s largest and most important squares, built in 1929 for the International Exposition. It was designed to impress visitors and serve as a grand entrance to Montjuïc, connecting major roads like Gran Via and Avinguda del Paral·lel.
20. Plaça de Catalunya
Plaça de Catalunya is the central square of Barcelona, connecting the old city with the modern Eixample district. Inaugurated in 1927, it covers 5 hectares and serves as a major hub for transport, shopping, and city life. Surrounded by shops, cafes, and fountains, it’s a popular meeting point for both locals and visitors.
21. Plaça Reial
Plaça Reial is a lively square in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, just off La Rambla. Built in the mid-1800s on the site of a former convent, it was designed to honor the monarchy. The square features palm trees, elegant arches, and a central fountain called the Three Graces. Notably, the ornate lampposts were among Antoni Gaudí’s first public works. Today, Plaça Reial is a popular spot for dining, nightlife, and enjoying open-air events.
If you are looking for a nice place to eat, I recommend this place.
22. Plaça de la Vila de Madrid
Plaça de la Vila de Madrid is a peaceful square in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, known for its hidden Roman cemetery. In the 1950s, during construction, archaeologists uncovered 85 Roman tombs dating from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. These graves belonged mostly to ordinary people — freedmen, slaves, and lower-class citizens — who were buried along a road leading out of the ancient Roman city of Barcino. Today, visitors can view the tombs from a raised walkway and learn more at the small museum on site.
23. Arc de Triomf
The Arc de Triomf is a big red-brick arch built in 1888 for a world fair held in Barcelona. It wasn’t made for war, but to welcome people from around the world. Today, it’s a popular place to walk, take photos, and enjoy the wide promenade that leads to Ciutadella Park.
🛍️ Markets & Shopping Streets
24. Mercat de la Boqueria
La Boqueria Market is Barcelona’s most famous food market, found right on La Rambla. It started way back in the 1200s and became a proper market in the 1800s. Today, you can walk through colorful stalls, try local street food, fresh fruit, and even grab some tasty tapas.
25. La Rambla
La Rambla is a famous street in the center of Barcelona, running from Plaça de Catalunya down to the sea. It’s always full of life, with street performers, small shops, cafés, and flower stands. It’s a fun place to walk, grab a snack, and feel the city’s energy.
🚡 Rides & Attractions
26. Telefric de Montjuc
The Telefèric de Montjuïc is a scenic cable car ride in Barcelona that takes you from Montjuïc Park up to Montjuïc Castle. Opened in 1970 and upgraded in 2007, it offers panoramic views of the city and the sea. The ride has three stops: Parc de Montjuïc, Mirador, and Castell.
27. Transportation Tickets

If you are up for reading the long part, we have🤔 Why Barcelona💬 Interview Process📑 Spain Visa🏦 Working in N26🏠 Flat-scene & Utility Bills🥘 Food💸 Budget☎️ Language👯‍♀️ Friends and Indian Community💔 Pandemic☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona
If you followed along, I had decided quite early I wanted to rent a studio apartment in Paris and live there as an adult. After graduation, and while working in Bangalore, I was looking for reasons to travel or move abroad as my weekend side project.
With my experience and profile, I figured I should diversify my options. So I applied to a lot of places for jobs — Ottawa, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, New York (yes yes I know how impossible the US visa situation is!). I was pretty much open to any city for the experience!
I had applied to an N26 opening that had Berlin/Barcelona/Vienna mentioned. During one of the interviews, the recruiter mentioned I was being considered for the Barcelona office.
Recruiter: “So what do you think Chhavi?”
The open-source community I contributed to back in college, had roots in Barcelona. I had visited Barcelona before twice and had absolutely loved it. I had tagged it as “my city” pretty much on the first visit. I was always super grateful to be in Barcelona, but never thought I could ever live there. It just never crossed my mind.🙃
The recruiter stared back at me through the zoom call.
Me: “I love Barcelona!”
A friend of a friend used N26, and he mentioned it to me. Mobile banks were still a new concept to me, so I did a little bit of research. A quick Google search listed all of these fin-tech darlings — Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26.
I found a mutual on LinkedIn and requested a referral. I saw on LinkedIn that they had a few folks from India, so I thought maybe…maybe they do sponsor visas. Long haul, but worth a shot. I waited for a bit and heard back from a recruiter 2–3 weeks later.
I was super excited to make it to the interviews. The “funnel” is so dramatic when you apply abroad — that this feels like an achievement. First I ordered and ate a lot of ice cream through Swiggy. Then I spent a lot of time preparing. More on this in part 1.
chhavii.medium.com
1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.2. Design Exercise. I was asked to design a mobile application for reading curated books.3. Video-call to discuss the Design Exercise. My first chance to interacting with product designers on the team. We talked about the exercise, about the team, and in general how I could contribute.4.Video-call with a Product Manager and a Product Designer. Here we talked more about product thinking, our take on MVPs, using data, making trade-offs, and working as a cross-functional team. 5. Video-call with Head of Design. We talked about my career aspirations, how they see the team growing, how I could contribute, and on giving back to the design community and making the product more inclusive.
1. N26 was looking for someone with my level of experience. Most of the times it’s not you. It’s just about what the team needs right now.
2. N26 was building a truly international company, hence was open to sponsoring visas.
3. The extra effort I had put to balance out my years of experience — I had prepared an analysis of the N26 app, and the ways I could contribute to the team.
The whole process felt pretty organic and I think took around a month. The part that was the biggest selling point for me was the people I talked with. I found all of them super respectful, and great listeners. We talked a lot about how they see the team growing, and how I could add to it. In hindsight, these conversations were such a strong indicator of why the team would be perfect for what I was looking for!
My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!
It wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.
My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.
N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.
The process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.
I had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.
Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!
Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️
On workWe worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.
It was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.
I also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.
The office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!
On design teamWe call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.
We had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.
Honestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.
Side note: I will share some more pictures on my Instagram stories here.
This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃
You cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.
Barcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.
My first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).
I had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.
I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩
At one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳
We could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.
It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀
Again, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the Menu del Dia — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!
I also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s ras malai.
It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂
A rough breakdown of my monthly budgetRent — 650 EurosUtility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)Groceries — 200ishTransport — 50ishTravel (pre-covid) — 400ish
Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!
I took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.
Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.
I had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)
I am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!
It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.
I remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.
I was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.
I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.
Even though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.
I sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.
I would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!

On November 6th 2021, Xavi Hernández Creus, one of Barcelona’s biggest legends and best midfielders ever, was appointed as the manager of FC Barcelona following the sacking of previous manager and club legend, Ronald Koeman — after a run of poor results, caused by the lack of identity and dynamism in football, that led to Barcelona being 9th on the La-Liga table when he was relieved of his said duties.
Xavi took the same team, with a couple of reinforcements in the following January transfer window of 2022, took the same team to 2nd place with an impressive period — playing some fluid and entertaining football, and also beating Real Madrid 4–0 in the process, ensuring the first El Clasico win since Ernesto Valverde’s departure.
The football witnessed initially under Xavi seemed very refreshing to a fanbase that had witnessed consistently underwhelming seasons of football prior to this — which prompted hyperbolic conversations regarding him being the ‘2nd coming of Pep Guardiola’.
He instilled an identity — provided a tactical foundation to a squad that lacked it very much; he deployed a 4–3–3, a more direct version than the conventional Barcelona style, but an entertaining and fluid style due to how the players inter-connected and understood their environment, which declined overtime due to the departures of some of the key ‘connectors’.
The following season (2022/23) — Barcelona proceeded to win La-Liga and the Spanish Super Cup very convincingly. Barcelona opted to play the box-midfield (midfield of 4) gradually as the season passed by, which helped neuter some of Barcelona’s core issues in the league, but were again exposed in some of the European nights (like Manchester United, Inter Milan).
Although Barcelona suffered a UCL group stage exit that season, the feelings around Xavi’s future / tenure were very positive, especially going into next season. Most seemed convinced that he was Barcelona’s man long-term. But, things went downhill this season with Barcelona’s levels of performance completely regressing while also going trophy-less, overall.
“Signing Xavi Is The Best Decision I’ve Ever Made Since I Became President”
These were the words of Joan Laporta, the Club President in April 2022, and in over 2 years — On 24th May, FC Barcelona announced that Xavi’s last game in charge as manager will be against Sevilla (the last game of the season) and he will not be continuing next season. There’s been such a drastic change in the perception of him as a manager over a year, something must’ve changed, and something did change.
Barcelona’s feelings coming into this season were relatively positive; the aim for this season was clear — an establishment of threat in Europe while maintaining the impressive domestic success we possessed, but did no one see coming this level of regression with regards to our overall style of play, rather than just losing out on trophies due to marginal differences.
Barcelona’s board parted ways with the previous sporting director, Jordi Cruyff (son of Johan Cruyff) and appointed Deco as the new sporting director; The club also parted ways with Mateu Alemany — which, essentially meant there was more responsibility in Yuste’s and Laporta’s hands — which was unhealthy, because neither have the credentials to be holding authority involving them to make sporting decisions.
Now, certain issues seemed to come with the power gradient — there was a lack of respect / consideration with respect to the manager’s decisions / preferences when it came to certain decisions that’d affect the manager the most, like the Vitor Roque situation. No board should sign a player with a manager you’re aiming to keep when he’s insisting against a particular signing, because it becomes unhealthy within the board & for the player’s future, as well.
A few issues became seemingly clear, and primarily, it was the unwarranted amount of influence Jorge Mendes (the agent) possessed on Barcelona’s footballing operations, when in reality — he has no authority to have such grave involvement, and it brings in an inherent level of bias in transfer operations, that could result in Barcelona settling for players with Mendes as agent, despite them being suboptimal for Barcelona’s squad, like the pressure make the Cancelo / Felix deals permanent, the heavy links with Ruben Neves last season etc.
So, in reality, there has always been suboptimal conditions in terms of board structuring and planning that can make it infeasible for managers to succeed at this club, and it was made much worse with the departures of Jordi Cruyff and especially, Mateu Alemany.
The handling of certain situations — including Xavi’s sacking has been extremely poor from the board. Poor treatment of personnel who genuinely commit their all towards the betterment of the club is an attitude that cannot last long at a club such as this, and will / can ultimately lead to the downfall of this particular mandate.
This was a ‘decent’ transfer window considering the financial limitations and there was a good initiative to complete sales of players that weren’t exactly contributing to the club in anyway, anymore. Oriol Romeu seemed like a very good signing at first, but it didn’t go as planned as the season went on due to confidence issues and also primarily — systematic issues that aggregated his flaws and didn’t provide him suitable conditions to succeed.
Felix and Cancelo seemed to be decent reinforcements due to their high technical potential and talent. The issue came with Cancelo’s and Felix’s mental profiles — often ignorant, unwarrantedly complex, reckless, more flair, less effectiveness, which, as expected, led to improper application of their high technical qualities and inconsistent showings in possession, combined with poor showings in general out of possession;
Regardless, Ilkay Gundogan, hands down, proved to be Barcelona’s best signing for this season by a mile. A footballer of the highest level — mentally, physically and technically. He is a true Swiss-Army Knife in every sense of the word due to how versatile, resilient and intelligent he is.
Transfers regarding personnel has been decent at best, but the overall squad planning and direction regarding overall club’s structure has been unconvincing and seems very unsustainable due to the lack of rational basis behind most decisions this particular dispensation has made. Far too ‘individualistic’ and preference-based without looking at the overall larger picture.
Despite current transfer planning / direction being slightly off, the investment in youth for the B team has been pretty impressive, especially under Deco, with signings like Noah Darvich, Ibrahim Diarra and Mikayil Faye. Although, there’s no balance with respect to elevating the 1st team while doing it sustainably on a financial level — hence, the lack of direction and planning I stated.
It’s been a disappointing season overall, from Barcelona, in the tactical domain, on both offensive and defensive fronts. As shown in a graph created by “Markstats” on X :
Barcelona’s deep entries in the opposition graph has massively declined while the opposition deep entries increased as the season progressed. Although, it is very important to note that most teams don’t look to threaten Barcelona through consistent entries / pressure in their box, rather — they use transitions / counter-attacks to try and exploit / attack Barcelona’s defense. But, Barcelona, being a dominant team in possession, in La-Liga, not being able to create enough deep entries, and it going to an extent that it’s not too dissimilar as opposition deep entries suggests poor effectiveness in and, also out of possession.
Barcelona’s issues this season showcase the fact that Xavi is an inexperienced coach with ideas that need proper maturing, multi-dimensionality and clarity in implication. It could, either, be an issue regarding a lack of transcendence of the ideas clearly or a lack of applying these ideas properly, or both — either way, both are co-related mechanisms. Let’s get into some detail.
Barcelona didn’t change much, in terms of their structural base or their formation in terms of positioning. There was a continuation on the 4–3–3 with often one forming a double pivot in build-up, as done last season, except it became more rigid, and horizontal relative to its surroundings. The reasoning is definitely due to Busquets’ departure — which essentially meant that Barcelona needed more dynamism / technical prowess in build-up, without a Busquets.
The replacement came in the form of Romeu, and the build-up responsibility gradually shifted more to Frenkie De Jong with Romeu assisting in build-up. Barcelona seemed ineffective on a consistent basis when it came to enabling effective progression when playing against opposition presses and already seemed to hit some road-blocks regarding fluidity last season, especially in terms of de-compacting opposition defenses (like Inter) but, this season, it got much, much worse.
What seemed to be the issue was — Barcelona had a structural idea in mind, but were incompetent in executing or even understanding how to utilize / implicate the structure to progress efficiently. Barcelona were too rigid / unpredictable, because of an obvious lack in fluidity.
This came due to one major factor, and that’s the DISTANCING. The distances between players became much larger to try and gain positional / numerical advantages, but it came at a cost of compromising for compactness and fluidity.
There was often the lack of an extra receiver between the lines, and instead there was an increased emphasis on playing extremely direct passes which came with the intent of exploiting space that exists, not creating or controlling. This can also be validated by how often Barcelona have to go long to feed runners, or put it on top of defenses to feed runners that does not sustain because it is a high ‘variance’ style and also, an easily readable and predictable style.
It also clearly explains how Pau Cubarsi’s inclusion has made Barcelona much more efficient on the ball — due to his immaculate tactical awareness and manipulation using his body language and footwork which results in creation of gaps / openings of lanes through which Barcelona can find a player better, like how Cubarsi often opens up the middle of the pitch to find Lewandowski directly.
Players do not move in closer proximities to combine, create space and release to the runners. Rather, Barcelona try to do the latter before-hand which is ineffective due to the opposition still maintaining numbers at the back, and the lack of proximity which can undermine the level of reception, and provide a higher risk to the pass.
This showcased the fact that this team had not culminated a set of consistent principles / a basis of automation in possession that would help them play through the opposition and utilize the potential of their structural knowledge into something much more useful and effective.
A conundrum that Barcelona often found themselves is that they were not given the clarity on when to keep the ball, how to keep the ball, and why to keep the ball. What leads to players playing extremely direct passes, and often turning games into chaos is a clear lack of clarity with regards to collective intent, and how to approach the game. That, combined with the larger distances between players, leads to what we call as — over-verticality.
Barcelona have become increasingly rigid in its style of play — a great example being, how often players out wide are completely isolated and have no pathway but to complete their take on, or lose the ball and concede a turnover — which made Balde an easy target to retrieve possession off if Barcelona ever went out wide to him, because he’s not a 1v1 monster; rather, he’s someone that would thrive on more rotations when wide, and more license to carry in the middle — that’s been clearly failed to be addressed due to the high and wide policy of our full-backs in build-up and attacking phases.
The rigidity and lack of fluidity transcends onto why the particular idea of Xavi’s Barcelona are so reliant / obsessed on / with 1v1 dribblers (Yamal / Dembele), and that’s primarily because that’s Barcelona’s only pathway (often) to creating space or progressing out wide due to the lack of rotations, when the whole idea of exploiting said ‘openings’ leads to not much good in the era of modern football due to the increasing amounts of compact defenses — opposition teams are constricting space very well and as often as possible.
There aren’t enough rotations, whether it is deep with the full-backs and midfielders, or whether it’s ahead with the wingers and full-backs. The rigidity prompts individual prowess and spontaneous solution-finding that leads to unreliability / inconsistencies in possession and often a chaotic style against better teams — because the players are playing at their own rhythm, understanding and intent, due to the lack of a collective idea of execution — which shows the lack of a principle base.
The lack of movement has caused Barcelona to become a static and predictable side, lacking basic combinations in possession due to rigid occupation of zones, rather than arrival and exchange of zones between players, often leading to predictable and pointless sideways circulation / forced passes forward to win 2nd balls or over the top of the last line.
The reason Barcelona look much more fluid with Pedri and looked more fluid with Busquets because these two players had a clearer picture of how to progress and play as a collective with the ball — they tried to receive and create shorter distances, dictate movements on the pitch and tried to retain possession when possible, as well.
Their INTENT was / is to extert control on the pitch, which is something Barcelona have massively lacked this season. There’s no quest for territory — that has led to the patchy form this season. Lack of territorial control leads to a game-model with high variance, which is basically, you don’t control enough possibilities to narrow games down to your favour and leave it out more in the open.
This can be validated by some of Barcelona’s poor field tilt statistics against competent opposition :
— Against Athletic Bilbao on March 4th (36.4%) — Against Real Madrid (30.1%) — Against PSG 1st leg (30.0%)
Barcelona play into chaos too much — there is such lack of re-organization for the team to even play in settled possession and when they do, these are the conundrums they face in possession. It’s very unlike a usual Barcelona team, to be honest.
To sum it up — lack of clarity, lack of emphasis on being more risk-averse, controlling and sustaining attacks / pressure has led to an incredibly patchy season, showcasing clear deficiencies with our play-style, despite Barcelona having the personnel to deploy a better style of football with more control, clarity and fluidity.
Barcelona have been very inefficient out-of-possession, and it shows in their massive increase in xGA (Expected Goals) by almost 6 (from 29.7 to 35), from last season. A more leaky defense, something that’s not anticipated from the team who was the best defensive team (on output) in La-Liga last season.
Barcelona’s press has been very lackluster against teams good on the ball. Teams like Girona and Real Madrid have been able to consistently play out of it with ease, and it goes beyond the personnel at the manager’s disposal.
Barcelona do press with a 4–4–2 structure, with often the advanced #8 and Lewandowski leading the front 2. Lewandowski, usually, aims to angle the opposition into playing out towards one flank, but the opposition can often find the free man pretty comfortably against the press, because the center is not compact, at all.
There’s a spacing issue with Barcelona — often, Barcelona find themselves so far apart from each other, that they cannot compact / constrict enough space to restrict their opponents. This is caused due to the extremely rigid man-to-man nature of the press. The players seem to be glued to one player of the opposition team irrespective of rotations / dropping deep that drives Barcelona’s key players out of position and also help teams find the free man with ease using overloads from deep.
(Source : @CaptnGuardiola from X)
This scatters the whole team — which leads to poor spacing and larger distances between each other. This level of complacency and rigidity in a team’s out of possession leads to a very exploitable approach — especially because Barcelona don’t have the highest intensity / dueling capacity, as well.
The last line of defense is also much deeper (out of cautiousness) which means the last line is looking to concede pressure / absorb pressure more than looking to close down / prevent the opposition’s by-passing to further continue until Barcelona’s box — which is one of the main causes of the uneven spacing. There’s also a clear lack of co-ordination on timing / jumps and collective movement when the press is initiated.
It seems very individualistic, with a lack of coherence and each individual with a different intent / approach to the press and that’s the sign of a lack of collective principles instilled; It’s clear that, this is more than just a personnel issue, and there’s an issue with Barcelona’s intent in covering space / the ball, that goes beyond the press.
A team’s ability to adapt to different game-states also depends upon how well-drilled and compact their blocks are. The low / mid blocks have been suboptimal from Barcelona — which, after the PSG games, many would consider a fair assertion.
Multiple games are evidence to this; the distancing between the lines has allowed too much central access to opposing teams BTL. The block tends to be too passive, allowing enough leverage around the box and solely relying on box defending, blocks and clearances.
The shifting leaves many gaps due to the larger distances between players and lack of coherence in intent. The intent in defending as an overall unit seems inherently flawed — too much of being ball-oriented and unnecessarily passive, rather than coverage of space, and compacting of space.
These are the major causes behind Barcelona’s inflation in xGA numbers and also general leakiness and lack of compactness in defense — defensive record being very poor compared to last year.
To sum it up — Barcelona have principle issues with how the football has been played, and that’s because the key enforcers on the pitch have left and we’ve been unable to put the structure to top use with coaching. Spontaneous dictators of play and solution finders like Busquets (mainly), Alba, Dani Alves and Dembele (1v1 prowess) leaving has caused a degradation in style of play due to Barcelona’s style of play, and effectiveness in style of play.
The core issue requires a manager change, unfortunately and that’s because the manager seems to be slightly inexperienced and his ideas on how to execute needs more maturation and learning — which is normal, but it also showcases that Xavi has a high potential if he can reflect on his mistakes, and what he needs to do to coach teams as a collective, better, without enforcers like Busquets.
Despite all the tactical shortcomings, Xavi has shown he is an excellent man-manager and can manage players very well by instilling a level of confidence and trust in them. He’s more than capable of pleasing a dressing room and motivating them, as a coach, and that’s an impressive quality to possess.
Barcelona have appointed Hansi Flick as the new manager, which is a slight philosophical change, but an ambitious and bold one — which only time will tell, if it pays off.
Thank you for reading; if you liked it, I would appreciate as many claps/likes, shares and comments as possible.
Much love, AM.

I recently went on what should’ve been the trip of a lifetime to Barcelona (Spain) and cities Bari, Noci, Aversa, Florence, Caserta, and Naples in Italy.
Like many trips, it was full of mishaps, twists, and surprises. But I ended up learning a lot about many things, myself included, and walked away with valuable lessons and a deeper understanding of what truly matters when exploring the world and reflecting on my own life.
And don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise.
I had initially planned to visit Rome and Pompeii in Italy, but due to time constraints, my friend and I decided to explore nearby cities instead, including Caserta. We toured the Royal Palace of Caserta before catching a train to Florence. We also ventured into lesser-known cities like Bari and Noci and had the chance to experience the vibrant Carnival of Putignano during our stay.
In Barcelona, I omitted places like the Sagrada Familia from my itinerary for several reasons: I hated crowds, was terrified of being pickpocketed, and didn’t want to go just to say I went. Additionally, since it was Ramadan for us Muslims, attending Mass at the Sagrada Familia felt sacrilegious, even if it meant gaining free admission.
Instead, I immersed myself in experiences that were more meaningful to me. I spent most of my time trying out exotic fruits I couldn’t find at home, browsing local grocery stores, learning about racial demographics and local history, talking to locals in Urdu and broken Spanish, researching the Romani people (as known as Gypsies), and studying the architectural details of everyday buildings. I have a particular fixation on doors, so I snapped as many pictures of them as I could as I roamed the city.
And I was perfectly happy doing so.
This is not to say that I didn’t do touristy things. I took a paella-making class in El Raval, where I learned how to make paella, danced around the kitchen, and had enjoyable conversations with people from Moldova, Turkey, Argentina, and the US. I tried tiramisu from every cafe I could. Afterward, I oohed and aahed at paintings in the Picasso Museum, marveled at the World Culture Museum artifacts, got lost on my way to the Chocolate Museum, and pondered the different tastes of Coca-Cola in Europe and the US at a cafe. And I shopped till I dropped, with bags full of spices, magnets, postcards, keychains, and chocolates from La Rambla.
Truthfully, I did feel guilty about “wasting” my trip. The voice in my head shamed me, telling me, “What’s the point of flying all the way here if you don’t check out Park Guell and the other tourist spots?”
But I listened to my body — my anxiety — which was screaming to be heard and decided to conserve my energy for another day of exploration. Instead of pushing my feet to walk the scenic mile home at peak traffic hour, I opted for an Uber, where I enjoyed pleasant conversation with the driver and saved my aching feet from further torment.
It’s not to say I played it completely safe.
Despite being told to avoid El Raval in Barcelona, I ventured there to check out vintage clothing boutiques, satisfy my homesick cravings for Pakistani foods, and buy custard apples. On the way, I went into a Pakistani jewelry store where I bought earrings for upcoming weddings and spoke to the kind store owner in Urdu. She was more than happy to discuss her son’s engagement drama and gave me a discount and free earrings. I wandered alone in the evenings, avoiding the dark alleys and blending in with a tourist group, and enjoyed the city lights. It was a peaceful way to enjoy the city’s vibrant lights and grew my confidence in solo travel.
They say travel broadens the mind and sheds light on the true nature of friendship. During this trip, I was lucky enough to experience both.
In Naples, I reunited with my high school bestie, who went above and beyond to ensure I had the best trip possible. She planned most of our itinerary, booked us a stay at a beautiful old apartment in Noci as a surprise for me, handled our high-speed train tickets for Florence, drove me around everywhere I needed to be, and indulged my constant whims for tiramisu. When it became clear that Italian food wasn’t meant for me, we loaded up on groceries and decided to cook paella at home, where we laughed, sang, and enjoyed one another’s company as we did so.
She also offered me the best of what she had — the master bedroom in her home, her nicest jackets, and the choice of going to Rome or Florence, Bari or Materra. She didn’t want me to pay for anything, but I insisted anyway because, despite the many problems in the way I was parented, one thing I was taught was never to take advantage of anyone’s kindness.
Our parting was more bitter than sweet. Despite doing almost nothing on my travel to-do list, the permeating odor of rotting garbage on the streets, and the death-defying traffic, I had the time (and the best tiramisu) of my life in Naples, the “trash can” of Italy, and couldn’t wait to come back and explore everything else.
Fast forward to Barcelona, where nearly every interaction with my other friend was wrought with tension, resentment, and impatience.
She nitpicked everything I did and said, walked ahead without stopping to wait for me, and made it clear that she didn’t want me around. She also claimed the nice double room in our Airbnb and had me choose between two closet-sized rooms so she could use the remaining room as her closet. I put my foot down and voiced my disapproval, where she eventually relented but gave me the silent treatment for the next couple of days. Despite my initial reluctance to explore alone, I braved my fears instead of putting up with my friend’s rudeness. To socialize, I called friends and family in the US and talked to them for hours. As miserable as I felt, I was touched that many people back home were rooting for me to have a great time in Europe.
Needless to say, this “friend” and I have parted ways, and I realized how disrespected and dismissed I felt in our friendship, as well as the many insults and snide remarks I overlooked throughout our time together.
Piggybacking on my previous point, we didn’t have the nicest lodging. It was clean, in the Sant Antoni neighborhood, surrounded by many things to do. And affordable. You do pay for what you get, especially for AirBnBs.
Our AirBnB had one double room, two single rooms, and no laundry services (despite them being advertised) or microwave. Our AirBnB hosts also failed to mention that there were no elevators in the building and that the walls were very thin. The beds in our rooms were hard and we woke up with sore, stiff backs every morning. The AC unit often turned on when it wanted to and I sweated right through my bedsheets at night.
It wasn’t an entirely bad place to be. Still, I would’ve appreciated an actual dryer machine instead of relying on the unreliable solar-powered clothes dryer on the terrace. And neighbors who were less vocal in their babymaking.
In several cities across Italy and in Barcelona, I quickly became a target for street vendors who could spot me as a tourist from a mile away. At first, I indulged them, buying a few gifts for my family back home. But the problem arose when I started being followed out of shops and booths, bombarded with pleas to “buy this” and “buy that,” often accompanied by sob stories about being an immigrant in a foreign country with large families to feed.
I get it — trust me, I do. As a former people-pleaser, I understand the urge to help. Most people-pleasers are empaths who want to save the world and make life better for the less fortunate.
But let’s be clear: traveling isn’t the way to fix everything wrong with the world. Europe is full of scammers and hustlers who won’t hesitate to overcharge you for something you could easily buy for a couple of euros at the local bodega. Learn to recognize the red flags. If someone is overly pushy or offers you something “for free” on the street, respond firmly with a resounding “NO!” Don’t worry about being rude — nice people make easy targets.
If you do want to tap into your empathetic side, try supporting local small businesses rather than money-laundering souvenir shops or tourist traps. Take the time to learn about the culture around you, try exotic fruits and vegetables, and always assert your boundaries.
Travel is one of those rare situations where I genuinely appreciate my resting bitch face. If you’re a soft-spoken people-pleaser like I used to be, one of my best tips is to put on a serious resting bitch face. It may be hard if you weren’t born with one, but trust me — this facial expression helped me ward off scammers, pickpockets, and hustlers. It also made saying “no” a whole lot easier. People tend to leave you alone when they think you look like someone who won’t tolerate their bullshit.
If mastering a resting bitch face feels impossible, at least look like you know where you’re going. Project confidence. Don’t act shifty; whatever youdo, don’t pull out your GPS in the middle of a sketchy area. If you need to check your phone, step into a store and ask the shopkeeper for directions.
If you’re from a country where seasoning is a way of life, like I am, you might find most European food a bit lackluster. Your best bet is to seek out Latin American or Asian restaurants or bring your spices as you explore.
I’m a huge fan of what Americans consider Italian food. When I was in Italy, I expected the food to be mind-blowing. Instead, I was met with disappointment. I found the dishes surprisingly underseasoned, missing the bold flavors I was used to in the US. For example, the pizzas I ate felt like they were missing key ingredients — salt, dried red chili pepper, and garlic powder. The carbonara at the cute local diner was far from the creamy indulgence I knew and loved in the States. Even the curry chicken pasta tasted like it was seasoned with nothing more than a Maggi instant noodle packet. For a foodie like me, it was almost heartbreaking.
Barcelona had a much better food scene, but by then, the damage was already done.
Despite the confusion, panic, and disappointment I encountered during my trip, I still had an unforgettable time. If anything, I’d happily redo my Barcelona trip knowing what I know now. Along the way, I’ve learned to embrace spontaneity, find joy in the unexpected, and trust in the good people I know. I also learned not to question the blessings that come my way — like the $150 I saved in baggage fees thanks to the kindness of airport staff in Europe. My ability to appreciate life’s simple pleasures — like admiring doors, staircases, and the frames surrounding iconic artworks — turned out to be the perfect way to ground myself amid the chaos.

Riqui Puig was supposed to be the chosen one.
He arose from a truly desperate era for Barcelona, one of sporting failure and institutional turmoil. A squad bloated with miscalculated signings, a board involved in criminal activity, and a team utterly reliant on the powers of Lionel Messi.
And yet, despite that mayhem, Riqui emerged. And he shone brightly.
“It’s a spectacle to watch players like him play,” said former AC Milan Coach, Gennaro Gattuso. “He’s got a kid’s face, but he has football inside. It’s something I marvel at.”
He wasn’t the only one marvelling.
An academy graduate and a born Catalan, Ricard Puig Martí, ‘Riqui’, was given almost heroic status upon his ascent to the first team. Through him, it seemed written that Barcelona would recover their identity and rule the world again.
But football is cruel.
Two years later, Riqui is nowhere to be seen. Since his emergence three seasons ago, his appearances have dwindled with each successive campaign. Now, he is a footballing outcast.
What happened? Was his quality enhanced by nostalgia? His destiny purely emotional?
Putting aside all biases, I want delve into the nuances of this tale. To unravel the downfall of Riqui Puig, and explain what went wrong once and for all.
This is going to be an in-depth analysis. It isn’t a quick read. If you want to skip any sections, here is your table of contents:
Without further ado, let’s get into this story.
I have to preface this with a disclaimer. In total, at the time of writing, Riqui Puig has played a grand total of 1,539 minutes for the Barcelona first team. That’s the equivalent of just 17.1 games.
As a result, the data behind his performances is limited. The sample size is too small to draw any definitive conclusions. For the majority of this story, we’ll be relying on what we can see on the football pitch.
I will be using some data where appropriate. For example, to point out general trends and measure certain attributes over time. But it will not be a stats-heavy analysis. Nor can it be.
With that in mind, let’s talk about football.
The context behind Riqui’s appearance was of injuries, financial impotence and COVID-19.
Still technically a B team player and only 20 years old, he was called up by Quique Setién to bolster a midfield during the relentless post-covid Liga schedule.
Frenkie de Jong was injured. Arthur Melo’s sale to Juventus was incoming. Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitić were ageing, the latter of which was the only cover to Sergio Busquets.
It was necessity that forced Riqui into the squad. But his footballing prowess kept him there.
Setién used a variety of systems in his short spell; 4–3–3, 4–4–2 and 3–5–2. But each was based on the same, possession-based principles:
It was a team that, despite its talent, often looked clumsy and confined. The cerebral, positional football of Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova had been long forgotten.
Here is a clip that sums up that Barcelona. Unforgivably narrow, with a string of short passes through the centre, ultimately looking for Messi to produce something.
In this environment, Riqui Puig was revolutionary. Why? He took this version of Barcelona, a sort of knock-off ‘tiki taka’, and injected a shot of the real thing.
In a tired, uninspiring Barcelona attack, Riqui was admired for his raw exuberance and quality. He brought a sense of urgency and imagination that was lacking from anyone not called Messi. Like Leo, Riqui had that ability to break the mould; to produce something unexpectedly brilliant.
These qualities were the basis of his wide acclaim. Of course, at that time, nobody was focusing on the nuances of his game. His movement, his decision making, his versatility, or defensive contributions. He was only young after all. Years later, we can look at these things with more objectivity.
With this context in mind, the next section is an in-depth profile of Riqui Puig the footballer. It will be largely based on his performances under Setién, but won’t completely exclude his later cameos under Ronald Koeman and Xavi Hernández.
I’ll try and paint as complete a picture as possible.
Starting with the obvious, Riqui Puig is short (5ft6), slender, and nimble. He’s abnormally quick over a short distance, but this is obviously compensated by his lack of strength and physical presence.
As you’d expect of a La Masia graduate, he is technically proficient with the ball at his feet. Excellent first touch, exceptional close control, and a precise passer across most distances — almost exclusively using his favoured right foot.
Riqui compliments his technical skills with a sharp mind, enabling him to make quick decisions in tight spaces or under pressure. This is one of his biggest strengths, which we will talk about shortly.
These attributes obviously lend themselves well to a creative midfielder in a possession-heavy team.
Under Setién, he played as a left centre midfielder (left interior) in a 4–3–3, or central attacking midfielder in a 4–4–2 diamond. In the current Xavi Hernández regime, he’s made his cameos as a left interior in a 4–3–3; his preferred position.
In terms of role, Riqui is what we might call a ‘connective’ player. Left to his own devices, he likes to receive the ball from the defenders, combine with the other midfielders in the centre of the pitch, and help turn low-threat defensive possession into final-third opportunities. Through precise passing and fluid movement.
This complimented perfectly the way Setién’s Barca operated. A lot of passes, mainly through the centre, to players in close proximity. It put Riqui in his element, and he performed brilliantly. Delivering moments of quality that turned deep possession into threat — like this disguised pass through the middle to Vidal:
Or this first touch flick between his legs, again to Vidal.
With workmen like Rakitić and Busquets behind him, and mercenaries like Messi and Suarez ahead, Riqui was the bridge between order and chaos. And it got the best out of his abilities.
Here is a typical heatmap to demonstrate his zone of operation, as an interior in a 4–3–3. You can see how deep he likes to drop, and how infrequently he goes beyond the 18 yard box. This is Riqui’s comfort zone.
In possession, Riqui showed promise for a few reasons:
Precise passing and movement
Riqui is all about moving the ball — both to keep possession and generate threat. His ability to pass accurately, and in a variety of ways, is paramount. While the data is limited, we can see a clear trend in terms of pass accuracy and chance creation.
You can also see he likes to play short and safe, with a relatively low number of progressive passes.
Part of what makes this possible is his off-the-ball movement. He’s a player that is drawn to the ball a lot. It means he gets a lot of touches, and his team maintain high possession. Later on we’ll see why this is a limitation as well as strength.
Rapid decision making
Riqui has an great close-quarters radar. When he drops deep to receive the ball, he doesn’t just do so for the sake of it. Often, he has a pass in mind before the ball arrives. It’s why he can moves the ball with just one or two touches.
This also leads to some decisive, imaginative progression, like the passes to Vidal we saw earlier. In his very best game for Barca, against Deportivo Alavés, this awareness turned into ruthlessness. In that game alone, he managed 5 shot creating actions and got 2 assists. A sign that he could be decisive, as well as responsible.
Close control and dexterity
To round off his positive traits, Riqui is a difficult player to dispossess. Despite his lithe frame, his control, awareness and acceleration make him particularly ‘press-resistant’.
The clip below gives a great example of that.
On to his weaknesses. And it’s here we get a glimpse of the story to come. Starting with his most regrettable:
Careless off-ball movement
While Riqui has a sharp mind for passes, his awareness is limited when it comes to the bigger pitcher: creating and exploiting space. His tendency to come short for passes is useful, but there are times when it hurts his team.
In the example below, his movement to the ball compresses space, congests the middle of the pitch, and makes it easier for the opponents to squeeze Barca.
Moments later, Nico González visibly waves Riqui away, telling him where to move.
This ties into a second weakness: not recognising where the space is. As a result, Riqui is hesitant to run in-behind the defence. He does it occasionally, but it’s not natural for him. This was a trend I saw in almost every game of his.
Riqui’s awareness of the immediate space around him is good, but his sense for the bigger picture, the fluid mechanics of a high-level football team, is not so.
Lack of versatility
What this amounts to is an inability to play any offensive position other than his own. He couldn’t be a winger, not because he is a poor dribbler, but because he wouldn’t understand the necessary movement and positioning.
Nor could he be an effective false nine, because he would not know when to drop deep, and when to occupy space.
The conclusion is very important: Riqui is excellent in his niche, but lacks versatility outside of it. At least, that’s the current situation. He’s still only 22, lest we forget.
The final pass?
This is difficult to judge, purely because of the sample size. Riqui shows flashes of decisiveness, against Alavés for example. But in many other games he’s shown a reluctance (sometimes a lack of ability) to execute the final pass. It was either too late, as he preferred a safe option, or it didn’t hit the target.
The remedy could simply be confidence, which is developed through game-time.
That’s why I’m also going to refrain from commenting on Riqui’s finishing ability. Perhaps he could become a decent goal-scoring midfielder, perhaps not. One way or the other, he would need the chance to prove it.
Unfortunately, when his team is out of possession, we have to skip over any strengths and move straight to the weaknesses.
I’m going to have to lean heavily on stats for this. I would rather not, but the consistency from game to game suggests that the numbers are reflective of Riqui’s defensive ability.
No matter what metric you look at, Riqui’s weakness is clear. I’m going to jump the gun and compare him to Barca’s current midfield options. Below are Riqui’s defensive actions across all his first team games, vs the current Barcelona midfielders in the 21/22 season.
Here’s the data — underneath I’ll list the key takeaways.
Applying pressure
If Riqui were to excel in any defensive metric, it would be here. In fact, he does make a lot of pressures. But they rarely lead to successful turnovers — only 21%.
Tackling
Not only does Riqui have the lowest number of tackles, but is also the least successful with his attempts. He wins the ball back just 18% of the time, leading to more players dribbling past him than his colleagues.
Interceptions and positioning
Of course, many midfielders make up for a lack of physicality and tackling by being excellent readers of the game. Riqui is not one of them. He intercepts less passes than any other of Barca’s midfielders.
This should give you a good idea of Riqui Puig’s footballing attributes. A player with undeniable quality in possession, but one whose profile narrows the more you look at it.
His defensive weakness is glaring, but perhaps more pertinent is his limited understanding of the wider game.
Both of these things bring us nicely to the modern day, where Xavi Hernández is building a team based on a very relevant principle: positional awareness. If you came here wondering why Riqui doesn’t get game time, these next two sections try to answer that.
Many Barca fans, especially those who had praised Riqui in the Setién days, were certain he would get his chance under Xavi.
In fact, reading Riqui’s profile, it might have occurred how similar Riqui Puig is to Xavi Hernández himself.
But it hasn’t happened for our boy. Why? We can only speculate. Based on what we know about Xavi’s Barcelona, there are a couple of relevant clues:
The fundamental pillar of Xavi’s Barcelona is positional play. It’s a philosophy developed most famously by Johan Cruyff, mastered by his Dream Team of the early 90s, and revived by Pep Guardiola in 2008/09.
In this system, the players aim to position themselves relative to their teammates, in order to circulate the ball effectively and be suitably placed to win it back. It’s all about angles, distances, and supreme awareness of the game around you.
Looking at some of Riqui’s movement off the ball, it’s apparent that his positional awareness isn’t always fantastic. We can only imagine that for Xavi, this is a big deal.
Despite being excellent on a micro-level in possession, it’s possible that Riqui doesn’t have enough understanding on a macro-level to use his qualities effectively.
This becomes more of a problem when we look at the new role of the interiors in Xavi’s Barcelona.
Rather than just controlling tempo in the centre of the pitch, turning defence into attack (which is what Riqui does best), the interiors in Xavi’s system are much more expansive.
In build-up, they play high and wide, often along the same line as the centre forward.
That means they’re tasked with much more than just keeping the ball. Along with the wingers, they’re the chief goal creators from wide positions. They are responsible for:
Xavi’s interiors carry a lot of responsibility, perhaps more than any other position on the pitch. They’ll frequently find themselves out wide, in the box, and orchestrating from deep all in the same game.
This requires a unique trifecta of quality, awareness and versatility. And as we’ve discussed, awareness and versatility are two of Riqui’s biggest offensive weaknesses.
In isolation, Riqui’s reliability in possession and ability to create goal-scoring chances would merit some degree of patience.
He might not have all these other attributes now, but given time and guidance, why not? We have seen enough raw quality to believe he can produce at the highest level. That’s surely worth investing in.
The problem is, he doesn’t have time. In his second year at Barcelona, as he wallowed on the bench under Ronald Koeman, the gates opened for a new crop of young, talented midfielders. Players that have stunted Riqui’s development more than any other factor.
Their names are Pedri, Gavi and Nico González.
If you want a quick and diluted conclusion to this story, you can discard everything I’ve said and walk away with this:
The long-term development of Pedri, Gavi and Nico are more important to Xavi than that of Riqui Puig.
We’ve already seen the defensive handicap Riqui has compared to his colleagues. That alone would be enough for most managers to sideline him. But considering how influential the interiors are in Barca’s goal-scoring— and considering this is a team that usually dominates the ball — their respective offensive abilities becomes much more relevant.
For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to compare each player to Riqui in turn, and give the top reason why I think each has won Xavi’s favour.
At only 19, Pedri is already one of best midfielders in world football. Utterly reliable in and out of possession, a full range of precise passing, a talented dribbler in tight spaces, and capable of match-winning goals. Most importantly, he understands positional play as if it’s second nature. Pedri is always moving. Not just looking for the ball, but creating and exploiting space for himself and others. A preposterous talent.
Advantage over Riqui: Higher quality on and off the ball, with a better understanding of positional play. There is no debate here.
At just 17 years old, Gavi is raw talent. Like Riqui, his close control makes him incredibly difficult to dispossess, regardless of space. But what sets Gavi apart is his tenacity off the ball. Under Xavi, Barca’s defence relies heavily on man-to-man pressure, quick turnovers and even tactical fouls. In all of these aspects, Gavi is far more capable.
Combine that with greater versatility, and a natural tendency to run in-behind, Gavi is imperious despite his youth.
Advantage over Riqui: Provides more cover off-the-ball, and has shown better awareness of Xavi’s system.
Nico, at first glance, appears the least remarkable of the group. While very tidy in possession, he lacks the imagination and unpredictability of Riqui. But he has something very important going for him: his physicality. Having been coached as a pivot in La Masia, not only is he clearly the best defensively, but is arguably the most versatile. Despite his size he’s shown impressive dribbling skills and intelligent off-ball movement.
With Sergio Busquets ageing, the team’s only ball-winning midfielder, Nico perhaps has a future in a more reserved role. If so, developing him now becomes absolutely crucial.
Advantage over Riqui: Better defensively and more versatile, able to play in any midfield position. He may be the future heir to Busquets’ throne.
In each case, there’s a reasonable argument for Xavi to leave Riqui on the bench.
Of course this is Barcelona, so there may be other factors involved. Political or otherwise. I would rather not speculate on those purely because we don’t have all the information. But from a purely footballing point of view, it’s not criminal to prioritise these other young talents ahead of Riqui. Xavi has said it himself:
“He has a lot of competition, fierce competition and I feel bad not giving him more minutes. He trains very well, I’m happy with him, he’s improving but the pity is that there is a lot of competition in midfield with Pedri, Nico, Gavi, Frenkie.”
Which brings us to the end of this piece. With Xavi’s first season nearly over, and a vital transfer window coming up, has Riqui simply run out of time? Or, perhaps, is there one last chance?
In 2018, Sport projected that Riqui would become one of the best players in the world. The latest news is that Barca have decided to sell him.
Riqui himself seems unmoved, recently claiming that he wants to fight for his place. But with so many players ahead of him, and the imminent signing of 7th midfielder Frank Kessié, it doesn’t seem reasonable to bet on the young Catalan.
If Barca want to register more players, they’ll be technically obligated to move others on.
In other words, it looks like the writing is on the wall for Riqui. And that’s a huge shame.
Like Gattuso, like thousands of others, I have always been a fan of Riqui Puig.
He does things every Barcelona fan wants to see. He plays one and two touch. He’s inventive and electric. His football language is pass and move.
But in the circumstances, none of that will be enough.
If Xavi had arrived in 2020, instead of Ronald Koeman, it could have been a different story. Perhaps Riqui would have been coached into the new system while his confidence was high, and without the burden of competition.
Now, as it is, his stagnation has left him too far down the pecking order. Talent only gets you so far at Barcelona, and sadly for Riqui, he’s never had the support or belief behind him to make the most of it. But for a miracle, time looks to be up.
Of course, football being football, you can never make any definitive conclusions. Perhaps, some day, the stars will align and Riqui will prove everyone wrong. Perhaps he’ll avenge his lost career. Like Gerard Piqué, Jordi Alba and Cesc Fábregas. Or perhaps not.
For a player with so few opportunities, the fan base he’s established is remarkable. If nothing else, it shows that patience, passion, and a love for your club go a long way. Whichever way your career turns, I’ll be rooting for you, Riqui.
And I won’t be the only one.
Thanks for reading, if you enjoyed be sure to leave a ‘clap’ and follow the page for more Barcelona content. I’d really appreciate it!

Residents of Barcelona turn away from tourism amidst record economic growth,https://medium.com/@archiecharlesworth_49320/residents-of-barcelona-turn-away-from-tourism-amidst-record-economic-growth-587282479ed2,"Sign up

“Visit Barcelona”, was once the slogan of the Barcelona Tourism Consortium, but in August last year it was replaced by “This is Barcelona”, after 15 years.
The change marks a new strategy of targeting “higher-value visitors who generate greater social return”. But it is also telling of the times, as mass tourism becomes increasingly unpopular within the city.
In 2024, some of Spain’s most visited cities saw anti-tourist protests, with demonstrations in the Balearic and Canarie islands, as well as Barcelona and Malaga. But these protests also came during a year of record tourism that proved to be vital in helping shape the Spanish economy for 2024.
This raises the question, why have the Spanish people fallen out of love with tourism?
Spain’s economy is thriving. In comparison to the five largest European economies (not including Russia), Spain had the most real growth in GDP in 2024, outpacing Germany, France and Italy — The Economist named Spain as their top economy for 2024.
Tourism contributed 0.76 percentage points to Spain’s 3.2% GDP growth, accounting for nearly a quarter of total economic expansion, according to Caixabank. Furthermore, the sector’s contribution to the GDP of Spain in 2024 reached 13%, and is predicted to continue growing in 2025, marking the significance of the sector on the Spanish economy.
But every silver lining has its cloud. Graffiti across the streets of Barcelona show a different side to the story. One such example (pictured in the beginning of the article) tells tourists to go home — others use far more colourful language.
There are several motivations for the turn away from the tourist industry, despite its positive economic effect. One of the most notable is that of housing.
A quick search on any popular listing app will show several rentals that must be vacated in the summer months so that the properties can be rented to tourists and other visitors who will pay more money for fewer days stay.
Jordi Nicolás Soler, 35, a lifetime Barcelona resident, explained the difficulties in finding a place of his own to live in. After nine years he was able to rent a flat, but it is small, on the ground floor, and has no natural light.
The problem, says Jordi, is exacerbated by short-term rentals and foreign residents who can afford to pay more than locals, pricing them out of the city. “Sometimes Barcelona feels like an amusement park; it’s not for locals anymore.”
Looking at the stats, there has been a steady increase in the price per square meter of renting in the last 5 years within Barcelona, according to Idealista, a property listings site.
In 2022, residents in Catalonia (the region where Barcelona is situated) on average spent 58% of gross income on rent, putting them in joint first place with the Balearic isles and beating out the Community of Madrid (home of the Spanish capital of the same name) by one percentage point.
“You feel like a foreigner in your own country.”
The increase in tourism has also put a strain on local culture and language. Barcelona is the capital of the autonomous region of Catalonia, which has its own distinct culture and language. But as more people have been visiting Barcelona, fewer people are speaking Catalan in their daily lives within the city.
A Catalan government survey conducted every five years found a decline in the use of Catalan as the primary language, alongside a rise in Spanish usage between 2018 and 2023.
“Spanish is probably the most spoken language in Barcelona,” says Jordi. “With English becoming more and more popular.
“As a Catalan speaker, it is very common for us to go anywhere like a supermarket and not be able to speak to the cashiers or the shop assistants in our own language because they already speak Spanish, and they know all of us speak Spanish, so why should I bother learning another language.
“You feel like a foreigner in your own country.”
The Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic (ABDT), an organisation working against the process of “touristification”, stress the need for regulation by the authorities. They state that regulation will be “inevitable” because if not the city will be reduced to “a mere stage set” that is “emptied of its population”.
The Generalitat of Catalonia has vowed to bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028 and has forbidden the issuing of new short-term rental licences in an effort to combat the rising cost of rent. However, such a drastic move has raised concerns regarding an increase in unlicensed rentals.
Even if regulation of rentals does improve the housing market in Barcelona, the AFBD are still concerned with other major issues caused by touristification.
Economic dependencies on a sector that requires stability to survive leaves the city vulnerable to crisis that can hurt the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic is the clearest example of this, as seen in the massive downturn of GDP production from tourism in 2020 and 2021 in Chart 2.
The ABDT also point out the issues with the labour market within the tourism sector. They say that it is one of the most exploitative sectors in the city in terms of working conditions, with hyper-flexibility, undeclared work, and outsourcing of services. Moreover, the average salary in the tourism sector is approximately 60% of that of the national average for all over sectors.
With around 9.1% of the population of Barcelona employed in the tourism sector, these are factors that affect almost one in ten residents.
Pushing for further specialization in tourism is essentially asking the local population to become poorer while others get even richer, says the ABDT.
“Don’t come.”
The ABDT make a point that their message is not directed at individual tourists, as they see little potential for a solution from that angle, instead advocating for a change in production rather than consumption.
However, this does not let tourists off the hook. They make it clear that in the current context, there is no possibility of a respectful form of tourism that benefits the local economy. If they had to say something to tourists, their message would simply be: “Don’t come”.

Everyone deserves a nice relaxing vacation. And I really felt the urge for my long-awaited dream vacation, when summer started.
Fortunately, we could get some last-minute deal and were able to book our first Mediterranean cruise. I was so excited to find that it was departing from Barcelona. I always wanted to visit Spain in my life and now here was my golden opportunity to explore this wonderful city.
In my heart, I could hear the lyrics of the song beating softly: “The Rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain…!” How could one forget the musical My Fair Lady and Julie Andrews singing this beautiful song?
So, we booked our flights to arrive in Barcelona two days prior to our cruise, hoping to spend time in this city filled with history, art and culture. My husband had spent time in figuring out how to quickly get around in the city and visit different places easily without spending much money and time. He also warned me that Barcelona is the capital for pickpockets and we decided to be extra careful. But that was it!
After our long flights, we finally reached our hotel in Barcelona. That evening, we bought our two-day Metro pass and set on our first day adventure to visit Las Ramblas. It was pretty hot and streets were over crowded, but I was thrilled to be in a city displaying beautiful architecture, art around everywhere. That was good enough for me to bear the heat and long walks. While enjoying sips of fresh coffee, tasting different flavors of ice cream, I also had some fun with bargain shopping. We returned to our hotel quite late, but I was glad that we were safe and sound. Since we made it safely through one day in this busy city, it built my confidence level more to travel by metro and wander around busy streets. However, it all lasted only for one more day!
Next day morning we set on our new adventure. We took the metro again and then hopped into the cable car to visit MontJuic Castle. I will never ever forget this day. No, I am not talking about the breathtaking scenery or historical landmarks, but about something unthinkable that happened to me. We enjoyed our cable car ride up the hill and exploring the castle. Everything went well until we decided to take the first stop on our descend by the cable car. I always love taking pictures, but this time I made sure to carry a selfie stick with me, so both of us could be in picture with the beautiful scenery in the background.
We found a beautiful spot, perfect with a railing to lean on and gorgeous view behind. Just as we were getting ready to take our selfie, two guys from the crowd came rushing as if they wanted to take pictures from the same spot. I politely told them to move away, so we can take our picture and then they can take theirs. They moved away a little bit and I clicked for our selfie. Oh, no! I could see the same guy in my selfie standing behind me. How did he even get in there? I was extremely upset but asked him again politely to stay away for a min, so we could get a clean selfie of just both of us. Another try and just as I am getting ready, he again comes rushing behind me, almost hits me from the back. Now I was about to lose my temper when I saw him photobombing my selfie. I quickly lectured him about good manners. Next minute they were gone. Well, I could finally take our selfie of just both of us, with great background and both of us wearing smiles.
Unfortunately, our smiles did not last much longer! Within a few minutes, I felt my bag was much lighter and realized that my wallet was gone from my bag. The zipper of the bag was wide open and the wallet that was so tightly fitting in the bag that even I would have trouble taking out was gone!
How could this be happening to me, when I have been so careful in crowded streets?? Oh NO…!!! Who and where?? How could this be happening? Suddenly I realized that I must have got tricked by those two strangers who posed like tourists and photobombed my selfie. I got distracted only for a few seconds, never even suspected those phony tourists trying to get closer to me. How did I not know their intentions? I quickly looked at my pictures that I took and there it was — the clear evidence of how this crime was committed. I could clearly see in one of the selfies the guy fiddling with my bag behind my shoulder. In the second selfie, same guy was holding my wallet in his one hand and holding his phone with other pretending to take picture. I tried to scream, warn other tourists — but surprisingly not a single person seemed to care. I asked for help to call police and again it seemed no one was worried. One of the street vendor said — “It happens all the time. Just cancel your credit cards, Police will be at lunch now and they don’t have time.” Such a cold atmosphere! I rushed to the cable car station and the lady there said she has no ability to directly call police but will try calling the main office and request them to call police.
Almost after 50 min, we saw two police officers taking rounds. We shared what happened with them, but they could not even take police report from me. I was about to enter in panic mode, but then I recalled my “calming mantra”!
My mom shared this Mantra with me — “Always try to be calm. Never lose your mind in any adverse situation and instead plan wisely to take correcting steps.”
“Crying does not help, take action,” my mom would always say.
What do we need to do now? We are out of country and on our vacation and here I lose my wallet with cash and all precious items. First things first! We started with calling the bank and others to report stolen wallet. It seemed as if it took forever.
Next, we headed to the police station. This was certainly not a planned destination on my vacation. But after 15–20 min walk, we arrived at the police station. This could really make another interesting story. A long line was extending outside of police station. This was only to speak to someone at the window. Every single person in the line had something stolen — either a wallet or their smart phone. After half an hour wait, finally I could speak to the person at the window. Then I was directed to the waiting room to see a police officer. Another 30 min wait time and I became restless. It was quite a large group of people and most of them shared that they had been waiting there for almost three hours. Such a long wait to report a theft! Meanwhile some of them shared their stories of how they got robbed. It was all shocking to me. Some lost their wallets/phones in Metro, some while walking on the streets and some in restaurants/bars or shops. That means no place was safe in this city. Some suspected small kids stealing, some had young girls luring them and some thought those were middle aged men/women dressed decently. No wonder it is called the capital of Pickpockets.
In any case, I could not bear the idea of waiting there for 3 hours. I felt my throat dry, but it was not possible to get even a cup of coffee. I tried my best, but I was asked to wait until my turn came. Maybe it was me complaining or it was my luck, but I was called in within an hour. We lodged the police complaint, shared the pictures of the suspect.
“What are the chances of finding this suspect and recovering my stolen wallet?” I asked.
“Not likely. We will inform you if someone returns the empty wallet. File with your insurance.” The officer said in a cold tone.
It was very clear that nothing was going to be done by police there. Now I know, why thieves make this place as their wonderland. There is no legal action taken unless stolen money is more than 400 euros. Oh well — it is a vicious circle! Thieves rob hundreds of people daily, police tired with making reports and have no intention of taking any action. This is like an infectious disease and it will continue to grow unless treated. Unless it affects tourism and economy of this city, there may not be any wakeup call for the officials.
We returned to our hotel after grabbing a soggy sandwich at McDonalds. The entire drama was physically exhausting and mentally draining. I was angry, but also sad inside. It was humiliating and at the same time I felt as if I lost my faith in all humanity. I considered myself quite smart and alert, but how could someone make me a fool? The entire incident replayed in my mind multiple times making me feel so silly and stupid. How could I fail to judge these people? And why me…?? I thought, this would make me crazy.
Okay, time to stop thinking and chant my mantra — “Keep calm”!
I tried to get all cluster thoughts out of my mind and then tried to sleep quietly thinking about our upcoming cruise. Just because someone stole my wallet does not mean they can steal my happiness and heart.
Amma, the renowned humanitarian has a great message. Remembering her words was a solace for me — “Don’t waste your time and never get attached to material things in life. Instead, build ever lasting relationship through love and compassion.”
I decided to follow Amma’s advice and stay positive. I also tried to build new friendly relationships on my cruise with an open heart. What a miracle! I met so many wonderful people on our cruise coming from different parts of the world. Language was no barrier here and age did not matter too. I made so many new friends.
Nature was splashing its beauty around. It was so nice to hear ocean waves singing at night and see the full moon rising over the ocean. I eagerly watched sunrise and sunset each day. I forgot all worries including my stolen wallet. Those were joyous moments that helped me overcome my stress.
Yes, occasionally I was haunted with thoughts of my stolen wallet and felt the pain. But there was nothing I could do. So why worry? After our cruise, I wanted to give one last try just for peace of my mind and get a closure with the incident. I decided to call Barcelona police stations as well as lost and found places in the city. Not a single phone call was answered. I was not surprised at all. What else to expect? So that was the end of story for my stolen wallet.
If you happen to visit Barcelona anytime, beware! Be careful taking your selfie and try not to lose your wallet or yourself, the way it happened to me!
Also next time, when I plan on taking my selfie — I will certainly make sure nobody is photobombing my picture!

If you watch Barcelona at this point, you would understand how aptly this gif epitomizes the current situation of the club, as we’re halfway through the season its looking like another one of those trophyless outings for the Catalan side. After already being out of the Spanish Super Cup & the Copa Del Rey technically they still have 2 major trophies to fight for including La Liga and the Champions League (yeah good luck with that!) but most fans have lost hope with this season. And now with Xavi leaving the club in the summer things are not looking good this season.
Let’s take a closer look at the underlying issues plaguing this club and how might Barca actually turn this around if they can that is.
Xavi as a player has been a core part of the Spanish national team and the mighty treble winning Barcelona squad which purely dictates his instinct as a manager and how he means to preserve the Barca DNA.
Since his arrival, Xavi has been using his 3–2–2–3 formation in possession or a 2–3–5 shape to great effect as seen below, this shape offers a lot of advantages in build up from the back and chance creation upfront.
This formation consists of a lone striker upfront as Lewandowski, two inside forwards preferably Pedri/Gavi & Gundogan, two wingers/wide players to hug the touchline preferably Balde & Lamine/Raphinha, two pivots preferably Frenkie & Cancelo/Romeu and 3 centrebacks preferably Christensen, Araujo & Kounde.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Xavi’s approach as he has used the same structure to win the league last season by scoring a lot of goals but also maintaining a solid rest defence at the back. Xavi wants his players to equally spread around the pitch and occupy each zone so that every player has passing options around them and can combine easily to escape pressure. Having 5 players in the front line enables them to frequently pull opposition players from the backline to create space with smart off-the ball movements.
With highly technical players deeper such as Frenkie, Gundogan they create loads of chances every game with balls over the top, line breaking passes, swerving crosses. Having Pedri, Gundogan & Gavi between the lines is important as they can easily receive the ball under pressure and turn in tight spaces to play the final pass. With young players such as Balde & Lamine Yamal in wide areas you get runners in-behind as well as players willing to take on fullbacks everytime. And with 3 solid centre-backs in defence they should (in theory) be able to defend well right?
But that is not the case this season, now let’s take a look at some of the issues holding this team back
After getting rid of Fati, Dembele, Eric Garcia and Ez Abde in the summer window Barcelona were mainly looking to add to their squad depth upfront. But with Barca’s never ending financial struggles, it meant that they can only look for less costly replacements, as a result Oriol Romeu and Inigo Martinez were signed to improve their squad depth at the back.
After showing interest in both João Félix and João Cancelo, Xavi was able to get both on loan, all thanks to them falling out with their respective clubs. Where Félix was looking for a fresh start while Cancelo was purely looking for regular playtime under Xavi. With this Barca capped of a decent summer window as compared to their Spanish rivals who went gung ho to improve their squad as well.
After a bothersome start to the season which saw Pedri & Frenkie getting injured and missing some important games in the first half of the season, Barca mostly relied on its youngsters with Lamine Yamal, Gavi and even Fermin getting some minutes every now and then.
Midway through the season they were hit hard by 2 more major injuries on regular first team players: Gavi and Ter Stegen which would see both of them missing the whole 23/24 season. Both of them were integral to Blaugrana’s success and the way they played last year which makes them difficult to replace.
A simple search query tells us that Barcelona have recorded the most xG in all of Europe’s top 5 leagues seconded only by Bayern Munich. But their lack of finishing up top has been a major concern as they have failed to hit the mark time and again. Though xG can be deceiving sometimes when teams attempt a lot of shots at goal, but if we look at npxG per shot Barca still ranks the highest in the league along with Girona.
While most top teams have exceeded their xG by scoring more with a fair margin Barcelona have struggled to put the ball in the back of the net, in fact among the top 15 teams in Europe they have the worst (Goals-xG) stat along with Chelsea (which is obviously not great company at the moment!).
Robert Lewandowski who has been a stellar striker throughout his career has been struggling to even make an impact this season, he’s been pretty subpar when it comes to linking up, making incisive runs and even controlling the ball in the penalty area.
Part of this decline is understandable as he is not in his prime any more and is probably enjoying what might be his last few years of playing at the top level. But, with lack of clear striking options for Barcelona where they loaned out Fati in the summer window, and Ferran & Felix both reluctant to fill the #9 position it has become quite tricky and definitely raises questions on the squad depth.
Though Vitor Roque who was signed in the winter as a long-term prospect might be able to challenge Lewandowski and provide cover for him at this moment.
Generally when we think of Barcelona we think of fast free flowing football, a team boasting of highly technical players all over the pitch playing proper Cruyff football. We rarely see Barcelona being associated with the word “defensive solidity”, but that is what happened last season when Barcelona displayed the best defensive record not just in the league but all over Europe!
A big part of this performance was Barcelona’s newly formed Back 4 which consisted of new summer signings Kounde & Christensen along with Araujo and a young academy prospect Alejandro Balde. This back 4 was Xavi’s preferred combination when fit which conceded just 20 goals in 38 league games and 46 goals in 55 matches across all competitions!
But this season, fans have seen a mere hint of past glory achieved by this combination as they’ve failed to keep clean sheets time and again and keep conceding goals to every opposition they play. Defensive errors at the back have become quite common and their defensive structure seems deformed most of the time. But, who is to blame?
Marc Andre Ter-Stegen who has been a loyal servant for the Blaugrana for almost a decade now, a club where he established himself as a world-class keeper and is undoubtedly the best ball-playing goalie in Europe right now is definitely being missed by everyone. He is a core part of the Barcelona defense as he vastly overperformed his expectations last season by keeping the most clean sheets in the league.
But Barca aren’t just missing his spider-like reflexes on the goal line, they are also missing his great passing range and ball playing prowess from the back. His ability to take charge against high pressing sides and playing a pinpoint ball to a free man upfront has been his career highlight and part of what makes him world-class.
Iñaki Peña who is currently filling for him in his absence has been subpar at best with a poor save percentage, he also clearly lacks the skillset Ter-Stegen has and still needs time to develop as a proper first team goalkeeper.
Conceding early goals almost every time has been the story so far this season as Barca conceded first in 7 out of 19 games before the winter break, with most of these goals coming just within 10 minutes post kickoff. As a result of the game state, Barca are bound to chase games every now and then which causes a lot of impatience among the players as they look to create chances as soon as possible.
Though this in theory should work in their favor but it has instead worked against them as an impatient pass during build up leaves them outnumbered at the back leading to a turnover at times when the defense isn’t expecting. This coupled with the fact that Barca have no natural ball-winners in midfield meaning their counterpressing has been pretty wasteful this season.
Of all injuries that have plagued this team, Barca were hit the hardest by Gavi’s absence, yes a 19-year old midfielder from La Masia is literally the heart and soul of this Barcelona team. His pressing intensity and passion for winning the ball back is unmatched not just in Barca but all over Europe.
The Golden Boy winner is already a regular starter for club & country and has been hailed by Xavi as irreplaceable in his side, despite his short stature he is brimming with confidence and always gives his best in every duel despite the odds. With Barcelona boasting of a highly technical midfield in Frenkie and Gundogan, Gavi provides the bite it needs to dominate every game.
After Busquets’ departure, who was arguably the greatest holding midfielder of his generation and someone who perfectly fit the job description and the style of play at Barcelona, Barca have struggled to match his numbers whether it maybe in defensive actions or the ball-playing abilities he had. Gavi definitely does not match his profile but has stepped up his game alongside Busquets and after his departure in the defensive shift he puts in each game. His ability to man-mark Bellingham and nullify his presence for 70 minutes in the El-Clasico is what amazed me the most this season.
Gavi’s still leading the charts in the number of tackles put in by Barca players despite being out for a major part of the season as shown below. In fact, he’s the #1 ball winner for the team in the attacking 3rd phase of the game and significantly reduces the number of turnovers Barca face.
Gavi is a player I personally adore a lot and he is someone whose mere presence would fix a lot of issues with this team right now. My personal favorite memory of him will always be winning an aerial duel against Wout Weghorst in the Champions League who with all due respect towers over him 😅.
The left-back role provides a tricky problem for the Catalan side in recent times which was sought to be over until the start of this season but instead grows even deeper. A 19-year old academy prospect Alejandro Balde in his breakout season showed the world why he deserves to be on the first-team sheet ahead of veteran full-back Jordi Alba. Balde exceeded everyone’s expectations and completely obliterated his critics with his stellar performances, despite that he has struggled this season and has definitely failed to make the same impact this year. But is it even Balde’s fault?
As discussed earlier Xavi wants to stretch the opposition backline by playing 5 forwards when in possession and in this system Balde is the one who provides width on the left hand side of the pitch. This totally suits Balde’s traits as he is a naturally offensive fullback who can easily slip past defenders relying solely on his pace.
Which brings me to my main point: Balde is an offensive fullback and NOT a WINGER! Look at these stats below comparing wide players from this and last season. Comparing his stats to a proper winger we can see that he attempts less take-ons than actual wingers and instead likes to go around the opposition backline.
While Balde definitely found success by taking on players last season he has been a shadow of his former self this season and part of the reason is that his game is not about taking on fullbacks or dribbling his way through the opposition backline with the ball. Instead it is more about the off the ball movements and the burst of pace he provides to attack space to play dangerous passes/crosses in the penalty area, which brings me to my final point.
Well “A picture is worth a thousand words” and if there is any truth to that adage here it is. Look at this image below, this picture clearly explains some issues with this squad that often go unnoticed.
This snapshot is from Barca playing against Real Betis which was also Balde’s last game after he was sidelined for the whole season. As we talked about Xavi’s structure before how he wants his players to occupy all zones when in possession so that every player has an outlet to play the ball to, in this case the left-half space is completely empty meaning that Balde has no one to combine with and has to play 1v2 against the two Betis players. This sequence results in Balde trying to take-on the fullback and playing an uncharacteristic cross which finds no one and possession is lost.
This issue is not limited to a particular sequence in this match, it has become a common theme among all matches this season which hinders Balde’s ability. The major issue here is player profiling, since the front five in possession consists of Lewandowski and Ferran playing together, both of whom like to drift into central areas and hence create this gap. Last season, this was not a problem as the front five usually consisted of Gavi and Pedri playing as the interiors so the wide players always found it easy to combine with them under pressure. But with Gavi, out of the picture Balde has been totally isolated on the left flank and can barely prove useful.
Barcelona have been blessed to have a Lamine Yamal among their ranks as the youngster has been beyond outstanding in his breakthrough season. In fact, Barca have been heavily reliant on this young prodigy this whole season who has lit up the league and is taking on every player left, right and center.
For me personally, Lamine has been the best forward in this team by a long shot and reminds me why I love watching this team. Despite being a 16-year old he is overflowing with confidence and is ready to take on defenders at will, escape from pressure and mature enough to release the ball at the right time. What amazes me is that he still has a lot of time to develop and with regular playing time in the coming seasons I’m thrilled to see what the future holds for him.
Gündoğan has been nothing short of world-class since the start of this season and has easily become the most consistent player in the squad. While all the other midfielders have been ridiculed with some form of injury in different phases of the season Gündoğan has been Xavi’s go-to-man in the middle of the park.
Due to his technical brilliance and reliability he has played more minutes than other player in the squad and has contributed in single phase of play. Though his preferred position is as an interior upfront, he has also played as a pivot covering for Frenkie in his absence making him extremely flexible. With the season coming to an end Barca could definitely use his clutch potential and big game mentality to save this season.
Though most of these issues and problems discussed above just seem to be small tactical tweaks & psychological issues with the players and their dropping intensity this season, which is not as bad as it looks. Since, Barca don’t necessarily need new personnel they just need to reinvigorate themselves and a couple of good results might just do that.
I hope this blog was worth your time if you made till the end, this took a lot of time & effort and was also my first attempt at bringing my Football knowledge & Data Analysis skills to the table.
Thank you for reading and have a good day! 😅

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

Commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.
Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto “Més que un club” (“More than a club”).[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world’s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the “Cant del Barça”, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

If you asked a fan on what Barcelona’s worst match of the season was, I’m sure they’d tell you it was Barcelona’s 1–0 loss at the Anoeta. As far as I’m concerned, that match left nothing for the viewer to enjoy after the first 15 minutes or so, and it was concerning for the fans who had been so confident regarding Flick’s football. The score-line in itself wasn’t the issue, it was the way Sociedad completely nullified any pathway for Barcelona to create or capitalize.
That performance sort of gave fans an impression that Flick’s football is very predictable, nullifiable, and a few rough games later, Barcelona are back with fans fully confident of Flick’s football.
For viewers who looked at the game tactically — the concern was, is Flick’s Barcelona inefficient against a M2M pressing side? At that point of time, the question was valid, but Barcelona has gradually proved that it’s principles in possession are not that easily contained, even if it is by a M2M side, and the game against Sociedad itself has instances where Barcelona seemed to be playing through them effortlessly.
Barcelona’s recent game against Atalanta is also validation to its ability in-possession. It definitely did not struggle as many did expect, although there was a lack of risk taking which led to a lack of penetration, but there was an overall lack of conviction within that performance.
Some nuance is needed to the whole ‘Barcelona are freelancing in possession’ discourse.
Barcelona have exceptional success against mid-blocks, that’s of absolutely no contention. 7–0 vs Valladolid and 7–1 vs Valencia are some great examples. These teams offer space ahead and behind, even if they’re not abundant, it’s enough for a team like Barcelona who have some great technical precision in possession.
But, with high-presses? Especially, a M2M? They give you no space and time in the 1st phase — which requires a proficient build-up. The assumption among a section of the fanbase is that, there’s no build-up with Barcelona, that I firmly disagree with, and the game against Sociedad is also an antithesis to that assumption.
Barcelona’s whole attack is like a flow, it really doesn’t have much segregation between phases — when it gets going in proper motion, obviously. The most intriguing part of Flick’s philosophy is how he’s much more focused on superiority via relationships and combinations rather than numerical advantages. Barcelona’s performance with Olmo as false 9 was so fluid due to the fact that he added much more fluidity in the combinations, and also provided situational numerical advantages in the middle of the pitch.
That movement and comfort dropping deep is a key feature of Barcelona under Flick and should be something the recruitment team should take a look into, when signing the next striker.
This flow begins with something (Jamie Hamilton) coined as ‘inside diagonals’ that’s usually played by the FBs to find either one of the #8s or the #9 to feed 3rd man runs. The movements are coordinated and it’s intentional, not coincidental, because these movements are consistent. A
An example from the Sociedad game :
First, Balde receives the ball and immediately cuts in to get in a position to play a diagonal between the two pressers.
Secondly, Lewandowski receives it slightly more vertical in a difficult angle with pressure from behind, so lays it off to Frenkie (who’s being marked) but has a dynamic advantage due to anticipating the combination beforehand. These details also tell you it’s not coincidental or just ‘winging it’ — it’s coached.
Thirdly, Frenkie plays it out wide to Fermin who’s free due to Sociedad committing very high with FBs and CBs which gives Barcelona an advantage in counter-attack.
It’s hard to believe considering the narratives that were fueled post this match, but there were multiple instances of space creation and combinational play like this, especially in the 1st half — but the imprecision and lack of wide threat helped them re-shuffle, compact themselves and prevent penetration inside the box.
Barcelona had much lower xG than Sociedad, but had a higher xT (it means they were in more threatening positions) which validates this point to an extent (considering for data irregularities).
The 1st goal vs Atalanta is also a prime example of this :
The same — Balde plays an inside diagonal, Lewandowski orients his body sideways to play a direct, perfectly weighted pass for a Raphinha running at full speed.
Secondly, Raphinha plays the pass to a free Lamine converging into the middle for him to score. Simple, dynamic, precise.
This is what I mean by, Barcelona don’t focus too much on numerical advantages, but dynamic advantages — anticipating space before the opposition does to create advantages while progressing.
Finding this diagonal is not always easy, because the FB requires space to find this diagonal but Balde’s very effective at doing so. Beyond that, there’s been an improvement at creating and finding space through such combinations, primarily due to 2 reasons :
It’s entertaining because it’s so expressive. Players have the license to carry, dribble, find their solutions, combine and interpret solutions based on the situation, but they’re guided with a set of principles, structure. Look at the movements of the players — they’re playing off the understanding they’ve of each other. There’s no one-dimensional role for any of them.
One element of Barcelona’s offensive competence is definitely its variety in attack. Let me explain — the best attacks have to be apt at creating and finishing their chances in different type of situations. Barcelona are excellent on the counter, are excellent at utilizing quick built attacks and are also excellent at slowly manufacturing chances.
This variety in their offensive dynamics is precisely their biggest success, because there’s no 1 pathway that limits this team from breaking you down. It’s what Flick’s Barcelona is all about. Flick’s the exact opposite of Arteta in the sense, he defends to attack and attacks to attack.
It comes down to the complementing nature of the 3 attacking profiles that’s supported by a strong midfield, with players like Pedri that create their own pace and rhythm to the game, and are able to give their team an advantage in possession against any team.
Lamine Yamal’s a proper maverick — he’s got that freedom to express himself and for a solid reason. He’s easily one of the best players in the world right now. He’s able to manipulate defenses through his dribbling and passing equally. He’s also developing the ability to be a consistent goal-scorer. He’s Barcelona’s X-factor in attack. He’s simply a chance creation machine because of his ability to read situations so well and do the appropriate thing accordingly.
Raphinha’s a proper runner. A prolific finisher and runner — it’s beyond the technique. His mental profile is one that needs commendable praise. He’s relentless, ruthless and keeps pursuing chances till the game ends. He keeps making these runs despite a shortage of delivery to be on the receiving end of at least 1 of them. The game vs Benfica is a great example, so is the Getafe one if he didn’t miss the final chance. He’s also very well rounded which doesn’t make him a liability in general play and he also aids in dropping deep to receive and adds a lot of transitional firepower for Barcelona — which is necessary in a team full of technicians.
Lewandowski is an all rounded striker. He’s losing his touch, imprecision is creeping in, but he’s still able to make ends meet with whatever he’s still got. On his day, was an incredible finisher and had a great skill-set that is visible till this date. There are instances where he makes certain flicks or passes that shows how good his link-up play was and how he’s still got glimpses of it. His hold-up play to generate separation is still class and would’ve been even better at his peak. A prime Lewandowski would’ve taken this attack to another level.
The 3 complement each other because you’ve one winger who’s like a machine at chance creation, the other who consistently runs into the box to be on the receiving ends of these chances and a striker who’s able to do both upon the situation’s necessity. That balance and understanding is why this attack has been so successful this season.
Barcelona’s probably been the best attacking team in the world this season — relentless, constant chance creation and a level of expressiveness from players with genuine talent that you don’t see that often. Watching this team gives me the impression that the players ‘feel’ the football they play — and that’s Barcelona’s biggest success of the season. A fundamental set of principles have been instilled that have made Barcelona ready to compete against any football club in the world — that’s precisely the progression arc this team needed and has gone through. A team that finds space and in the process harnesses each individual’s strengths, gives room to interpret situations and solve problems based on the team’s requirements.
So much emphasis on on-field relationships between players that makes the football truly entertaining to watch. Players understanding each other’s movements, combining in close proximities to release one another, build quickly and move in synergy.
It’s entertaining, it’s enticing. It comes with its risks, but it’s worth it if managed properly. That’s Flick’s Barcelona for you.

A data-driven strategy to rebuild Barcelona’s core and prepare them for the 2024/25 season.
Barcelona has faced tough times since Covid, especially after losing their biggest star, Lionel Messi. The club has made several big signings since then, but not all have been successful. As a data scientist, I want to imagine a strategy meeting with Deco, Laporta, and Flick to help rebuild Barcelona. Using my Moneyball approach, we’ll explore affordable solutions to strengthen the team where it needs it most.
To tackle Barcelona’s issues, I studied Hansi Flick’s Bayern 2021, a manager and a team I admire. I analyzed key players from that era to find current, affordable alternatives. For example, I used Lewandowski’s 2021 stats to identify a low-cost striker, as Lewy isn’t getting any younger. I also explored Müller’s 2021 profile after Barcelona signed Olmo as a number 10 and Kimmich’s 2021 profile out of curiosity. Beyond Bayern’s comparisons, I felt Barcelona needed a pacey left winger and a creative right back, leading me to analyze Nico Williams and Cancelo from the 2023–24 season.
Finally, I’ll share my ideal lineup and the reasoning behind each choice. Let’s dive into the data.
For Cancelo, I employed a dual approach: first, I analyzed his aggregated stats from the last four seasons to identify proven players with consistent performances. This method helps to highlight experienced players who have maintained high levels of play over several years. Second, I focused on his stats from the most recent season to uncover any potential hidden gems. This strategy is particularly useful for spotting emerging talents who had standout performances last season and could offer great value as rising stars.
Barcelona’s tradition of dynamic full-backs demands a solid replacement for Cancelo. Last year’s signing was reminiscent of Barcelona’s golden days, but with no clear pursuit of Cancelo now, I explored low-cost alternatives.
Di Lorenzo and Hamari Traoré emerged as top options. Traoré, in particular, shows promise as a strong, reliable choice.
Despite a dip, Cancelo’s playmaking remained elite.
Among new talents, Tiago Santos stood out. He’s quick, skillful, and has the potential to grow into a superstar, though he can be caught defensively at times.
For his age, Tiago Santos shows great potential. Barcelona could lock down the right-back position, a position that since Dani Alves left never looked the same, for years with him. While he occasionally struggles defensively, especially in aerial duels, with the right development and environment, he has the makings of a future superstar. Portugal’s depth at right-back is impressive, and Santos could be the next big name.
Tiago Santos. His blend of youth, skill, and potential makes him the right choice to secure Barcelona’s right-back position for the future.
Nico Williams is a top-class winger — exactly the type of player who is direct, exciting, and can create something out of nothing. There were strong links to Barcelona, but it seems he’s staying at Athletic Club, where he’s been honored with the iconic number 10 shirt. With that in mind, I explored low-cost alternatives through a Moneyball approach using his 2023–24 La Liga stats.
Sávio was another strong candidate, but he’s already settled at Manchester City. After eliminating left-footed wingers and those recently transferred, Chris Führich from VfB Stuttgart became the standout choice. Führich shares many qualities with Williams: he’s quick, direct, and has a knack for creating opportunities in tight situations. His playstyle could make him an effective and low-cost option for Barcelona.
Although it may not have the same allure as a big-name signing, this is about finding under-the-radar talents that fit the needs. In fact, Führich could also be a great addition to a team like Arsenal, known for their creative and dynamic wingers.
So, while it may not be the headline-grabbing signing fans might hope for, going for Chris Führich would be a smart and pragmatic decision for Barcelona.
Lewandowski’s 2020–21 season was his peak — a complete striker at the top of his game. Although he’s still delivering for Barcelona, it’s time to plan for the future. Using his 2020–21 stats as a benchmark, I analyzed current players to find a similar profile.
Top names like Haaland and Kane naturally showed up, but they’re either unattainable or don’t fit Barca’s needs. Jonathan David, however, stood out as the ideal low-key option. With one year left on his contract, he’s an affordable, long-term solution who can grow into the role.
Based on the data, Barcelona should strongly consider Jonathan David as Lewandowski’s heir.
In the 2020–21 Bayern squad, Müller and Kimmich caught my eye for their extraordinary performances, so I decided to explore how Barcelona could benefit from similar players.
Müller is often underrated, but in 2020–21, he was truly world-class. Using our Moneyball approach, we explored potential alternatives to Müller, identifying players who exhibit similar qualities.
And who do we see among the top alternatives? None other than Dani Olmo — a player who might just be the key to Barcelona’s future under Flick. It’s intriguing to see Olmo here, and it feels like a promising sign for what’s to come.
Also, a special mention to one of my favorite playmakers in Europe, Lorenzo Pellegrini, whose inclusion here highlights his underrated brilliance. These insights could be vital in shaping a creative and effective midfield for Barcelona.
It feels like more than just a coincidence that Olmo appears among the top alternatives. His presence here might be a significant indicator of how well he could fit into Flick’s system at Barcelona. Let’s wait and see how Olmo performs under Flick’s guidance — there’s a lot of potential for something special to develop.
When news broke that Tuchel didn’t see Kimmich as a central midfielder last season, it sent shockwaves through the football world. To me, it was baffling, given how Kimmich was one of the best in that position during the 2020–21 season. A move to Barcelona seems like a perfect fit, though it would be costly this summer. Perhaps next year, with his contract nearing its end, it might be more feasible.
Here’s what I found when comparing his 2020–21 stats with current players.
The list of top names didn’t surprise me, but one detail might have slipped by — yes, Ilkay Gündoğan from last season is in there. With news of him leaving for free, it’s a significant loss for Barcelona. It will be interesting to see how they adapt and what strategies Flick might propose to fill that gap.
With all the key positions addressed and some interesting insights uncovered along the way, it’s time to visualize how Barcelona could shape up for the 2024/25 season using the data-driven approach we’ve explored.
Let’s take a look at the proposed lineup and see how these carefully selected players can help Barcelona reach new heights under the guidance of Hansi Flick.
If Barcelona were to follow my data-driven approach, this lineup would reflect not only the numbers but also my vision of football.
I opted for Christensen because he has exceeded expectations in the deeper midfield role, especially crucial in the first leg against PSG where his absence was felt in the second leg. De Jong’s ability to carry the ball from deep is invaluable, but with Pedri and Gavi’s injury issues, especially Gavi’s serious one, it’s wise to manage their workload.
I also prefer having a left-footed center-back for optimal passing angles. The full-backs should be balanced, with one focusing on direct play and the other offering creativity. On the wings, a skillful player paired with a direct one complements an all-round forward to complete the ideal setup.
I might be stepping into Flick’s shoes, but this lineup is inspired by his best side.
This approach demonstrates how a data-driven approach can offer practical solutions for squad building, even for a club as prestigious as Barcelona.
The proposed lineup represents a balanced approach, incorporating a mix of youth, experience, and players who align with Flick’s tactical philosophy. While it might seem underwhelming compared to Real Madrid’s recent signings, these players are chosen based on their fit within the system and potential to grow into key roles.
What do you think of this lineup? Who would you suggest using your data-driven approach to strengthen the squad?

How do I summarize Barcelona in one short piece? Perhaps I can’t, but here I will try my best to provide an introduction. With a population of 1.6 million, it is one of Europe’s largest cities and the continent’s fourth most visited city.
Located on the northeastern coast of Spain, Barcelona has sunny weather year-round and beaches stretching up and down and all along the Mediterranean. Restaurants aplenty, a thriving music scene, nightlife and outstanding Modernisme architecture on every street corner, it’s not surprising that Barcelona has become a top tourist destination for visitors hailing from all over the world.
Let’s start off with an overview of Barcelona’s most popular neighborhoods. Down by the beach, great seafood, surfing, and chiringuitos (beach bars) can be found in La Barceloneta. To the north lies Poble Nou, with tech start-ups scattered around the famous Agbar Tower. Back over to the east of Barceloneta is the Old City or the Ciutat Vella, which encompasses El Born and the Gothic Quarter, divided by Via Laietana. Here you’ll find old Roman excavations, medieval churches, with lots of small cafes and boutiques in between.
El Raval is the city’s more risqué part of town, be careful going here at night. Travel up the hill, eastward and you’ll hit the Eixample, Catalan for “expansion.” This area was built more recently, starting in the mid-1800s and is easy to navigate, with its wide avenues like Passeig de Gràcia and gridded plan. At the top of Passeig de Gràcia, you’ll enter into what was once a small village, La Vila de Gràcia or simply Gràcia.
Each neighborhood has its own personality which is one of the things that makes Barcelona such a vibrant and diverse place to live. If you want to see them all in one day, it is certainly possible, as Barcelona is bien comunicado or easy to get around.
Rent a bike for around 20 euros a day, or grab a T-10 card at one of the metro stations (10 rides for 10 euros) and use it for the metro, bus, tram, and even some regional trains. Taxis really aren’t necessary, unless the metro is closed… even then there are night buses! Side note: Barcelona’s metro operates from 5AM to 12AM from Sunday to Thursday. On Friday it stays open until 2AM, on Saturday it runs all night.
Biking is a smooth ride in this city. There are no steep hills in the center and Barcelona has an ecosystem of well-connected bike lanes. The same goes for the metro. Several lines run through the city with many connecting points and lots of friendly station managers willing to help you reach your destination. Or, just ask a local. Barcelonís are quite friendly and relaxed and used to seeing tourists. They even have a name for them here, guiris.

Being the capital of the autonomous region of Catalunya, Barcelona and the surrounding area have their own traditions, many involving food. Lots of the ingredients, the recipes, the celebrations, and the rituals differ from the rest of Spain. At the same time, it has always been a cosmopolitan place, a terre de pas, and its traditions have been influenced for centuries by foreigners who pass through or settle down. Vice’s Mikel Iturriaga explains:
“Catalans mix meat and seafood in the same recipe — it’s called mar i muntanya, which means “sea and mountain” in Catalan — in a way that seems rather odd in the rest of Spain. And Catalans have a huge tradition of pork sausages — fuets, butifarras — but they don’t use paprika in them, like in chorizo. They also like garlic A LOT, and their most distinctive sauces aioli [“garlic and oil” in Catalan], or romesco, are definitely not suitable for vampires. They have quite unique ways to treat vegetables, burning their skins to get them a smoky flavor, like in escalivada, or to thicken sauces in fish or meat stews. Flour is never really used, but a “picada” (an almond, parsley and garlic mix) gets added at the end of the cooking process. Oh! And they invented one of the best things in the whole world: pa amb tomàquet, toasted bread scrubbed with ripe fresh tomato, garlic, salt, and olive oil.”
Like in other parts of Spain, a Catalan’s daily schedule is a bit unique. Meals happen a lot later than in the rest of the world, and there are different types of meals such as la comida, tapas, and pintxos. Catalans eat breakfast around 10 or 11 AM, and lunch at 2 or 3 PM during siesta. Dinner doesn’t happen until 9 or 10 PM; most restaurants won’t open for dinner until about 8:30 PM (unless they are in a touristic neighborhood).
Part of this could be attributed to people wanting to seek shelter to avoid the intense, midday heat. Other people point out that Spain is not in the correct timezone.
Back in the day, the country’s clocks were set to the same hour as the UK and Portugal, calculated using the mean solar time. But on March 16, 1940, Spain’s brutal dictator, Francisco Franco, changed the time from 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM to display the same time as Nazi Germany and other Nazi-occupied countries further east. As Lauren Frayer of NPR explains, this was done to show support for the fascist government of Germany. To this day, Spain is not in its natural time zone, though there is talk of changing it back.
As I’ve mentioned, lunch is the biggest meal of the day in Spain. While it is falling out of tradition, many people take a break from work and go home to eat lunch. For this reason, most smaller stores will be closed for siesta between 2 and 4 PM (or 5 PM).
The menu del día involves a lot of food and is surprisingly easy on the wallet. What is it? Usually, it is a three-course meal, drink included, that is offered on weekdays at lunchtime. Most restaurants will have a sign outside advertising their offerings, with several first courses, second courses, and desserts to choose from. If you go to a truly authentic place they will sometimes leave a bottle of house wine on the table (don’t get too greedy!). Prices vary from 7 to 15 euros per person, depending on where you go. Tip: this is a great way to try the food at a nicer establishment at a reduced rate.
In Barcelona, tapas are small plates of food meant to be shared and usually accompanied by a glass of wine or beer. There are several theories surrounding the emergence of tapas. The most fun involves a king with an illness and a special diet (consisting of small snacks throughout the day) who demanded that all alcoholic beverages be served with a bite of food. The most practical story is that barmen began covering drinks with a slice of bread or cheese to prevent flies from taking a bath in patrons’ drinks.
I have to agree with Mikel Iturriaga when he recommends avoiding touristic restaurants (if they have a laminated menu outside in 10 thousand languages and an aggressive waiter beckoning you in, run for your life!) Instead, Iturriaga recommends trying “unpretentious restaurants like Envalira or Casa Agustí, or new places like Suculent or Mont Bar, where they give the old Catalan dishes a modern twist.” He also mentions a few of Barcelona’s traditional bodegas or small wine shops where you can sample different wines and tapas: Bodega Montferry, Bodega Salvat, Cal Marino, or Bodega Quimet which are all excellent and easy on the wallet.
Another fun food to try are pintxos or small bites of food with a toothpick on top. They are normally displayed on top of bars, to be eaten with a glass of wine or beer. Though not originally from Barcelona, pintxos bars can be found all across the city. In fact, there is one magical street you must check out: Carrer de Blai. Carrer de Blai is a pedestrian walkway lined with outdoor terraces serving pintxos. Each restaurant does them differently, so you can hop from one to the next, sampling whichever bite-sized delicacy looks best to you. The barman will charge you based on the number of toothpicks left on your plate when you’ve finished your meal. For a list of the best pintxos in Barcelona, check out Barcelona Hacks’ recommendations.
Catalan food leads us to another topic… Catalan culture. Barcelona is the center of an area proudly known as Catalunya, one of 17 autonomous regions in Spain. Catalunya has made worldwide headlines in recent years from the Independence Movement that has been taking place, most notably with the elections in 2017. It has its own language, customs, traditions, food, many of which differ from those in other parts of Spain: a controversial ban on bullfighting, the caga tió at Christmastime, and the castellers, to name a few. Catalunya prides itself on innovation, art, and as you will see, architecture.
Barcelona’s three patron saints are Santa Eulalia, Santa Mercè, and Sant Jordi… and well, maybe we can consider the fourth unofficial saint to be Antoni Gaudí, the city’s celebrated Modernisme architect. Some of his most famous works include:
Gaudí always turned to nature when it came to his designs, for he felt there was nothing man could make that nature had not already created. As author Robert Hughes writes in the Guardian:
“He never ceased to draw on nature. Each paving-block of Passeig de Gracia features a starfish and an octopus, originally designed for the Casa Batlló. Turtles and tortoises support the columns of the Nativity facade of the Sagrada Familia, which also has 30 different species of stone plant copied from the vegetation of Catalunya and the Holy Land.”
Following Greek tradition, Gaudí even used living people as models, casting them in plaster to create his sculptures for La Sagrada Familia. But maybe Gaudí took his obsession with Mother Nature too far. In creating the church’s “Massacre of the Innocents” scene, he asked a hospital on Las Ramblas if he could cast the corpses of stillborn babies in plaster. He must have made a solid case, for they agreed.
The city lost its beloved architect in 1926, several days after Gaudí was hit by a tram while crossing Gran Vía de les Corts Catalanes. At 74 years old he was completely focused on constructing La Sagrada Familia. At this point, he had become depressed and stopped taking care of himself. His hair and beard were long and unruly, his clothing tattered, and when the police arrived at the scene they thought he was a beggar. In these times the poor were not adequately taken care of and he did not receive proper treatment.
When you look up things to do in Barcelona, you’re sure to find the Barcelona Cathedral listed as one of the must-see attractions. However, my favorite church is not technically a cathedral, though it is referred to as one. Catedral del Mar, or “Cathedral by the Sea,” is the scene of a new Netflix series by the same name.
The church dates back to the 1300s and is located in Barcelona’s El Born district, next to a lovely old square that was used for local festivities, celebrations, and events during the Middle Ages. Unlike the Barcelona Cathedral, which was funded by and built for the bourgeoisie class, the Catedral del Mar was funded by, built for, and built by the fisherman and port workers living in the surrounding neighborhood of La Ribera. Known as bastaixos, the men who built the church carried each individual stone on their backs all the way from a quarry in Montjuic. If you’d like to understand how arduous this was, you can follow the bastaixos’ 8-kilometer walk that has been recreated by RouteYou.
If you are an FC Barcelona fan, you’ll also have a good reason to visit the church. If you spend enough time inside staring up at its stained glass windows you’ll find a small FC Barcelona shield embedded in one of the designs. Back in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, a group of anarchists set the church on fire, destroying much of the artwork inside including the windows. In the 1960s, FC Barcelona donated money to help restore the building, and the shield was added as a small thank you.
One thing to keep in mind: always keep an eye on your stuff, especially in the metro and near major tourist attractions. While Barcelona is an extremely safe city in terms of violent crime, pickpocketing is a big problem here. Many people even wear special pickpocket-proof bags, though I think holding your backpack in front of your chest on the train is sufficient.
I’m a big fan of off-season travel: if you go in the fall, winter or even early spring, you’ll escape a lot of the crowds but more importantly the heat waves that sweep the city in summer. You’ll also save a bit on flights and accommodation. If you do decide to visit Barcelona during the summer, my recommendation is to spend some time away from the city itself. Rent a car and explore beaches along the Costa Brava, or out in the Balearic Islands. Barcelona is hot and humid in July and August, and, to be frank, the cleaner beaches (with fewer bachelor parties) can only be found by getting out of town.
Of course, this isn’t actually “all you need to know about Barcelona.” Here I’ve only skimmed the surface of Barcelona’s rich history, architecture, cuisine, and art. There is so much more to be discovered in this Mediterranean paradise that my sister jokingly referred to as “Magic Land” during her visit last summer. It’s a place to disfrutarse, to slow down, to have long lunches and to soak in the strong sun that rarely sees a cloud obstruct its rays.

Recommended time of stay 1.5 weeks
Overall Vibe of the place: fun, touristy, energetic, friendly
Barcelona! Wow what a perfect place to start off my solo trip, it is full of life, architecture, friendly people. It just has this fun, friendly party vibe to it with so much to see. But it also has a huge amount of tourists so be ready for lots of people walking around with camera’s, there are also a lot of pickpockets especially in the touristy areas so be sure to watch your stuff. My friend came to visit me in Barcelona and got his wallet stolen and was only there for like 4 days. It’s definitely a huge problem but you should be fine as long as you are careful.
There really is so much to see in Barcelona but here are my top places that just really stood out.
If there is one place you need to go to in Barcelona it is the Sagrada Famillia. My heart literally jumps every time I see it, the architecture is just so detailed and fantastical, I was amazed to find a new thing every time I examined the structure. With detailed carving all around, mosaic tiles, and words all around the building it is the most interesting beautiful building I’ve ever seen in my life. It kind of reminds me of a magical and very detailed sand castle.
Now to go over the inside, I would say it is worth is to see it on the outside just onlooking the building but it is even MORE worth it to go inside. I got so emotional inside I literally had to cry a little because it was just so beautiful I couldn’t believe it. With tall grand high ceilings meant to replicate trees, and rainbow colors of light reflecting through the windows it just had this sacred feeling to it. I’m pretty sure I stayed inside for at least an hour just looking around taking it all in. I honestly can’t compare it to any other place I’ve been to. It sort of has this sci-fi feeling to it like your in a futuristic spaceship or something. I love Gaudis work for his uses of curves, and combining classical architectural ideas with natural subjects and designs.
A little about the building, it was built by Antoni Gaudi and it is so detailed it is still not complete yet but is projected to be done in 2026 (I can’t wait to see it completed!) to coincide with Gaudi’s death in 1926. Gaudi’s body is also buried inside of the Sagrada Famillia which makes sense since he dedicated part of his life to working on this structure and never worried about how long it would take. I guess this really teaches you truly great things take a lot of time.
Also I recommend you purchase your tickets AT LEAST 3 days in advanced I bought mine 2 weeks in advance which you don’t need to do but they sell out very fast.
Another building designed by the great Antoni Gaudi (he really is a genius and I wish I could’ve met him). Located in the Illa de la Discòrdia and commissioned by Josep Battló who was a wealthy textile manufacturer. He gave Gaudi full creative access to do whatever he pleased and boy did he. Their are no straight edges throughout the entire building and it has this sort of under water playful aquatic feel to it. When I was climbing up the stairs I felt as if I was in a pool of some sort. Once you get to the top you have an stunning view of the city along with mosaic designs throughout the top area. I’ve never been in any place like this and I don’t think there are many building out there with these types of designs so it is a must see especially for architecture lovers.
I will admit this is a very touristy area but I can definitely see why, I love walking through the small alleys with beautiful windows and architectural designs with every step you take. Also I’m not a big person for tourist shops but these shops seemed less basic and more interesting. I bought a handmade leather bracelet as my tourist item and the women makes all of it there she even sized it in front of me to fit my tiny wrist haha. The restaurants are all fantastic in this location and be sure to buy some hot chocolate they have rich, thick hot chocolate almost everywhere you go, its basically hot pudding and it is heaven.
Right in the Gothic District is the Gothic Quarter and it is free to go in at the right times (From 8 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. to 7:30 p.m) otherwise you just need to pay a donation fee. The building took almost 2 centuries to build, yeah thats right and you can tell walking past it you can’t help but stop and stare and it to take in all the elegance of it.
This is the beach to go to just to sit and relax, its right next to the Gothic Quarter so its the perfect place to take in some sun after walking around all day. The water is really warm I even checked it out at night and it was still warm and swimmable. Theres a lot of young tourists here and it’s next to all the nightlife happening so this is the place to be.
The Picasso Museum is one of the best museums to go to for all you Picasso fans out there. It shows his evolution as an artist and how he did different things at different periods in his life. I have to say I was very pulled into his simple pencil and paper drawings since I like to draw myself it was refreshing to see some his mistakes and messy lines which really reassured me as an artist that everyone makes mistakes. It also showed me that it is completely normal to go through different design periods throughout your life. His work really took me away and brought me into his most memorable times in his life. I didn’t realize this till later but the museum is free Thursday nights from 6:30–9:00pm to try to check it out then.
Another wonderful achievement by Antoni Gaudi, originally a garden city and later commissioned by Eusebi Güell to redesign it. He continues with his playful, colorful, and smooth designs throughout the park. He wanted to keep its natural design and just build on top of that. While adding detailed mosaic tiles and keeping the natural ground stones all over the park. Not to mention the spectacular view you get of the entire city in the park, this is definitely a place you wouldn’t want to miss.
This is the club I went to to see one of my favorite bands and the show was amazing but I was blown away by the club myself. This is a place where people come for music and I can tell I even made some friends on the rooftop of the club. There is a stairwell section with red lights and the design of it just really surprised and delighted me. No one was pushy here and the drinks weren’t too much definitely a place to check out if your into live music.
Since I was in Spain I had to try out the rich thick hot chocolate that they seemed to have everywhere and hands down this place is the best. I can really tell the quality and taste is truly exquisite. I love the interior of this place also it’s really great for just working on your computer and relaxing and the staff was very friendly and polite.
Located in Catalonia, Spain this huge museum is surely a place to check out while you’re in Barcelona. They have all different types of artwork throughout history ranging from gothic artwork to renaissance showing how history has made art evolve throughout time. They also have a featured side exhibit at the museum, when I went it was Dali and Gala and how they both inspired each other with their artwork. This is a huge museum so be sure to plan staying for the full day (I would say 2–4 hours at least).
I really hope this helps you out on your next trip to Barcelona and let me know if you do go to any of these places!

Intro
As someone who wakes up early, I have come to appreciate breakfast out of the house more and more. Either as a solitary occasion to gather my thoughts, take time out, and plan for the day, or as a social event with a like-minded early riser, usually a fellow entrepreneur in my case, such as my good friend and local businessman Gunter, who is in the sex shop business, but that is a curious side note. We all know having variety in your personal and business network is wise!
So, after doing the rounds and trying several breakfast places out, a few good, some mediocre, and many terrible, I want to document my own personal top 4 in Barcelona.
If you are looking for coffee shops or patisseries, this will not be the article for you. There is an abundance of these in the city. Being an amateur athlete (I say that very loosely, as if football and gym sessions count for something) and a growing boy, I need some protein for breakfast, so to qualify for my list, the places needed to have some solid egg-based or protein dishes as menu mainstays. Also, and I must be pedantic on this, I am talking strictly about breakfast, and not what has come to be the trend in recent years — dare I say it — brunch! Please allow me to go on a tangent here before we get to my list, but I am pretty much anti-brunch and anti a lot of what brunch represents. Don’t get me wrong, the dishes are nice, but the concept of mid-morning eating of what is essentially breakfast for late risers and posers is not my cup of tea. I’m here for the good old-fashioned pre-10:00 a.m. breakfast, or 08:00 on the dot if I can get it.
So here is my list, as a local in Barcelona and in no particular order of ranking:
№1: El Corte Inglés
Plaça de Catalunya, 14, 08002 Barcelona
Classic, no-nonsense, and great price point. Open from 09:00, you can choose from either an omelette and toast or freshly made Tortilla de Patatas with toast. Located pretty centrally in Plaza Catalunya.
№2: Café de l’Architecte
Rambla de Catalunya, 76, 08008 Barcelona (attached to Hotel Condes de Barcelona)
A bar and restaurant attached to the hotel Hotel Condes which sits on the corner of Rambla Catalunya with Passatge de la Concepció. It’s a nice spot and an intimate meeting point. Open from 09:00, it would be great if it opened at 08:00, but I guess they don’t see too much demand for that. They offer a nice variation of choices and additional ingredients for your omelette or scrambled eggs. If they were to add some artisanal coffee and tea options, to their menu it would be a plus, but I will cut them some slack on this, as the establishment has an air of the traditional to it.
№3: Billy Brunch
Various locations throughout the city.
One of the best for options, variety, and choice. It’s probably better known as a brunch spot, but it opens at 09:30 for people like myself who value breakfast over brunch. I’ve been to various locations of theirs throughout the city, and I’m yet to be disappointed by the service. There is thought attached to the attention to detail of the service at Billy Brunch, which I love especially because Barcelona restaurants often struggle to offer good service, mainly because they probably don’t feel they need to make an effort with such a high footfall of tourists and transient clientele walking in. Billy Brunch however bucks that trend, and they make a fantastic Chai Latte, one of the better ones in the city actually which is always a plus for me as someone who doesn’t drink coffee.
№4: Citizen Café
Pl. d’Urquinaona, 4, L’Eixample, 08010 Barcelona
One of the few good breakfast places in Barcelona that opens from 08:00. This spot became my place for post-early-morning gym session fuelling. Located in Urquinaona and with a wide variety of menu options, this is breakfast done well and at the proper time for those of us who have busy days ahead and things to get on with. The staff have been very pleasant here in my experience. Like the other options that serve brunch, this place starts to fill up quite quickly. It’s been a few weeks since I’ve been myself, so I’m looking forward to heading back here soon.
There might be some options that are new or that I am not aware of. I typically value a central location if I am meeting people, so maybe there are local spots in Barcelona’s neighbourhoods that I should consider. By the way, if you’re local and in business like myself and fancy joining me next time for a networking breakfast, shoot me a message. Remember, breakfast not brunch! And if you are visiting this wonderful city and looking for some early-opening, good options for breakfast, then I hope you enjoy these recommendations and let me know how you get on with them in the comments.

Have you ever wondered how a storied club like FC Barcelona tackles financial challenges while enhancing fan engagement? In today’s evolving sports landscape, Barcelona has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) as a crucial tool for improvement. By integrating AI into various operations, the club aims to elevate on-field performance, enhance fan experiences, and make smarter financial decisions. This transformation illustrates how innovation can lead to sustainable success in a highly competitive environment.
In recent years, Barcelona has faced significant financial hurdles, accumulating a staggering debt of €1.35 billion. In light of this daunting reality, the club recognized the importance of harnessing technology to strengthen connections with its vast global fan base. The sports world has seen how data-driven approaches can personalize experiences, enabling organizations to better understand and cater to the preferences of their supporters. By leveraging AI, Barcelona is positioning itself to innovate and thrive amidst challenges.
One of Barcelona’s innovative steps into AI is the implementation of AI-powered chatbots designed to engage fans in real time. These chatbots provide personalized content based on individual preferences, making interactions feel tailored and efficient. Fans can quickly find answers to questions about ticket purchases or player stats, simulating a conversation with a knowledgeable friend. This not only enhances the fan experience but also drives merchandise sales. Studies show that 69% of consumers prefer chatbots for fast communication with brands, reflecting the growing expectation for swift responses in today’s digital world.
These chatbots are adept at handling up to 80% of routine customer service inquiries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex issues. In many industries, organizations have turned to AI to enhance customer service, enabling faster responses and improving overall satisfaction. Barcelona’s approach illustrates a blend of technology and personal touch, emphasizing the importance of understanding fan needs and preferences.
Barcelona has also embraced AI algorithms to analyze fan data and deliver personalized content. By tailoring news articles, videos, and social media posts to individual preferences, the club significantly enhances the overall engagement of its supporters. The club’s dedicated Twitter account for personalized content has witnessed a remarkable 30% increase in engagement compared to its main account. This level of engagement mirrors the success of leading brands that utilize consumer data to create relevant experiences, ultimately driving sales.
Furthermore, this personalized content strategy has resulted in a 25% increase in the time fans spend on Barcelona’s digital platforms. Insights from behavioral psychology emphasize that when users feel valued and recognized, they are more likely to engage with a brand. By leveraging AI for tailored content, Barcelona fosters a deeper connection with its supporters, ensuring they feel appreciated and involved in the club’s journey.
Barcelona’s commitment to innovation extends to its training facilities through a partnership with Pixellot, which has developed AI-based video analysis systems. This technology automates the recording of training sessions and matches, providing coaches with in-depth insights into player performance. In the competitive world of sports, analytics have become essential, much like how successful teams leverage data to inform strategies and enhance player development.
The impact of AI-driven video analysis has been significant, with coverage now expanded to 16 pitches across Barcelona’s complexes. This increased visibility has enabled the club to broadcast previously unproduced youth matches, resulting in a staggering 40% increase in viewership. Such advancements illustrate how data analytics can reveal opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed, allowing teams to engage more deeply with fans and cultivate future talent.
In addition to enhancing fan interactions and on-field performance, Barcelona utilizes AI tools to analyze fan preferences and behaviors. This strategic approach allows the club to create more effective marketing strategies and build deeper connections with its audience. For example, AI-driven insights have led to a remarkable 20% increase in merchandise sales, illustrating the power of targeted marketing efforts.
Moreover, Barcelona has achieved a 15% improvement in fan engagement metrics across its digital platforms. This proactive stance reflects the importance of data-driven decision-making in today’s business landscape, where understanding consumer behavior can lead to substantial gains. These insights highlight how critical it is for organizations to stay attuned to the needs and desires of their audience.
The cumulative impact of these AI-driven initiatives has been impressive. Barcelona has reported a 35% increase in digital engagement year-over-year and has expanded its global fan base from 250 million to an estimated 350 million supporters. This growth illustrates that fans are not just passive observers; they are actively involved in the club’s journey and development.
While the advancements in AI present a promising future, the club also faces challenges, particularly in data collection. Despite its massive fan base, as of 2022, Barcelona held detailed data on only about 1% of its supporters, highlighting a critical area for improvement. This situation emphasizes the need for organizations to continually enhance their data strategies to build stronger connections with their audiences.
Barcelona’s successful integration of AI not only enhances performance but also presents a unique business opportunity model for other clubs and organizations. By focusing on fan engagement, personalized marketing, and data analysis, sports teams can cultivate a loyal fan base and drive revenue growth. The lessons learned from Barcelona’s journey serve as a blueprint for others looking to navigate similar challenges and harness the power of technology in sports.
Moreover, this model isn’t limited to sports; businesses in various sectors can leverage similar strategies. The principles of personalization and data-driven decision-making are increasingly becoming standard practices across industries. In a world where consumer preferences are constantly evolving, understanding and adapting to these changes is essential for long-term success.
Ultimately, Barcelona’s journey into AI amidst financial struggles offers valuable life lessons. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances is vital, both in sports and in life. By embracing innovation, individuals and businesses can overcome obstacles and create new opportunities. As author and philosopher Alain de Botton reminds us in The Art of Travel: “We are often at our most interesting when we are in a state of uncertainty.” Barcelona’s story illustrates how a shared passion for the game can unite fans and inspire creative problem-solving.
As we reflect on Barcelona’s commitment to AI and fan engagement, it’s clear that the essence of connection — whether with fans, customers, or communities — remains paramount. Building relationships rooted in understanding and empathy can lead to enduring success. In a world of rapid change, the lessons learned from Barcelona’s experience serve as a reminder that with innovation and resilience, the future can be brighter than ever. (Dadang Irsyamuddin)

Barça’s 2023–24 season is being far from good. They’re currently 6 points away from the leader but with one more match played — so the difference could rise to 9 points today — and the number of goals they’ve received this year in 18 games is already higher than the total goals from last season.
Not good defensively, but the offense doesn’t compensate for it.
In this post, I’ll oversimplify the causes of Barça’s situation focusing on numbers only. Of course, these only explain half the equation: the apathy or lack of motivation we’re seeing on the pitch can’t be translated into numbers… Yet.
But stats are rather the consequence of these psychological factors.
If you’re a FCB fan and have been following their last games, I might not discover anything new here. But I believe this could be a good read for those who don’t and those who want to learn how to use stats to understand the game.
Here’s a summary of Barça’s last 5 matches, ordered chronologically:

How I Felt Watching Barcelona Lose – A Fan's Honest Thoughts
It’s not just a football match. It’s not just a scoreline.When Barcelona loses, it feels like a piece of my heart gets bruised.
I still remember the feeling. The final whistle blows. The players drop their heads. And I just sit there, silent, staring at the screen. Not because of the loss—but because of the love. The deep connection I’ve built with this club since I was a kid.
When I watch them lose, I’m not just disappointed. I feel helpless. Because no matter how much I scream at the screen, nothing changes. And yet—I stay. Every game. Every season. Because I believe.
But this loss… it hit harder. Maybe because of how it happened. Maybe because we expected more. Or maybe because I’m just tired of defending a team that sometimes forgets how much they mean to people like us.
Still—I’ll never walk away. Because true fans don’t run when it hurts. We just keep loving harder.

The House on Tibidabo in The Shadow of the Wind
One day during our trip to Barcelona a few years ago we decided to ride all the way to the top of Mount Tibidabo, the highest hill in the city. We had to ride on three separate means of transportation to get to the top, but we did it!
First of all, we walked to the Metro station at Placa de Catalunya and boarded the brown line (L7) train which took us to the base of Avenguda Tibidabo. Then we walked across the street from the Metro exit to board the Tramvia Blau, an old streetcar line, which brought us halfway up the mountain. Finally, we transferred to the Funicular de Tibidabo to get to the top.
There at the top we found an old amusement park adjacent to a Catholic church called Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor (The Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Heart). You can see this church and some of the park’s rides from just about anywhere in Barcelona. And we soon found out that you can get one of the best views of Barcelona from the roof of this church.
In Carlos Ruiz Zafon’s masterpiece The Shadow of the Wind we follow Daniel Sempere as he traces the journey of Julian Carax (the author of a book also called The Shadow of the Wind) to the Tibidabo mansion where his love Penelope resides. Zafon himself loved to ride the tram and then the funicular to the top and gaze at the view of Barcelona. The tram opened in 1901 and the blue cars reminded me of San Francisco’s fabled cable cars. It was thrilling to consider that we may have ridden on the same car that carried both Zafon and Sempere up Tibidabo.
There are many turn-of-the-century mansions that line the slopes of Tibidabo. The most prominent is El Pinar, the home of the banker Manuel Arnus near the base of the funicular and the end of the line of the blue tram. I photographed this house after exiting the funicular on the way back down Tibidabo. I at first thought that this was Zafon’s mansion but later discovered that Zafon himself told us that the address of Torre Aldaya in The Shadow of the Wind was Avenguda Tibidabo 32, which is a few hundred meters down the hill. The building at this address is not as gothic looking like El Pinar and Zafon probably combined the appearances of several Tibidabo mansions when he imagined Torre Aldaya. The building at # 32 is now the Hotel Mirlo, a five-star boutique hotel.
El Pinar was designed by the famous architect Enric Sagnier in 1902 and the house was completed in 1904. Sagnier also designed the magnificent Sagrat Cor at the top of Tibidabo. The church’s crypt was built between 1902 and 1911 and construction of the upper church began in 1915. Sagnier’s son Josep Maria Sagnier completed the construction in 1961. The original statue of the Sacred Heart on the roof of the church was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The present statue, by Josep Miret, was completed in 1950. In this photo one of Christ’s apostles overlooks Barcelona and the huge communications tower on the next hill.
I understand the Tramvia Blau is presently closed for reconstruction. There is a bus (# 196) that now connects the Metro with the funicular.
Zafon wrote The Shadow of the Wind in 2002. It was translated into English by Lucia Graves in 2009. I came across it in early 2015 and immediately began plans for a trip to Barcelona and we flew to Spain later that year. The second book in the cycle Zafon has named The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is called The Angel’s Game. I read most of that book on the plane and finished it during our stay in Barcelona. It is a prequel to The Shadow of the Wind. I then read the third book in the cycle, The Prisoner of Heaven, shortly after returning from our trip. Lucia Graves, the excellent translator of Zafon’s Spanish works, completed the translation of The Labyrinth of the Spirits in 2019. I didn’t get around to reading it until last year. Then I reread the other three books and enjoyed them considerably. I’ll probably read all of them again someday.
Zafon was born in Barcelona in 1964 and later moved to Los Angeles where he wrote screenplays in English. But he wrote all of his fiction in Spanish. He died of cancer in 2020 at the age of 55.
Most of the actions in The Shadow of the Wind take place in the Bari Gotic and Raval neighborhoods south of Placa de Catalunya. Visitors to Barcelona can sign up for a three-hour literary walking tour that covers these areas. Tibidabo is too far away to be included in this tour, however. We didn’t take the walking tour, but we came across many of Zafon’s landmarks while following a couple of walks that Rick Steves recommends in his Pocket Barcelona.
Tibidabo gets its name from two Latin words: dabo meaning “I will give” and tibi meaning “to you.” For more info on Barcelona’s highest hill see my Crow Canyon Journal blog postings here and here. Better yet, read either an English version of the Bible or St Jerome’s translation into Latin of Matthew 4:09. And then read all four books in The Cemetery of Forgotten Books cycle for the full story of the Semperes, Daniel’s friend Fermin Romero de Torres, and that haunted mansion halfway up Mount Tibidabo.

My First Love: FC Barcelona
Love has many forms. For some, it’s a person. For others, it’s a moment, a dream, or a place. But for me, love came dressed in red and blue stripes, roaring through the TV screen, dancing on the green fields of the Camp Nou. My first love was not a person—it was FC Barcelona.
I still remember the day it all began. I was barely ten, sitting in my uncle’s living room in Nepal, surrounded by laughter and the buzz of a Champions League night. On the screen, a team moved like poetry. There was elegance, unity, magic. And right at the heart of it all was a little magician—Lionel Messi.
That match changed everything.
It wasn’t just about the goals. It was about the way Barça played. The way Xavi pulled the strings, the way Iniesta glided past defenders like a painter with a brush, the way Messi turned impossible moments into memories. It was like watching art.
From that day on, I was no longer just a boy in Nepal—I was a culé. I read articles, watched every highlight I could find, begged for a jersey with the number 10. I started waking up at 1 or 2 in the morning just to watch La Liga matches live, my eyes sleepy but my heart wide awake.
When we won, I was on top of the world. When we lost, I felt the heartbreak. Every El Clásico became a festival in my house. My room slowly turned into a shrine—posters of Ronaldinho, Messi, and Puyol, stickers of the crest, and scarves with “Més que un club” boldly written across them.
As I grew older, life became more complicated—school, pressure, reality—but Barcelona remained my constant. In the hardest moments, watching Barça play felt like coming home. It reminded me who I was, and who I wanted to be: someone who plays with heart, who stands for something, who never gives up.
I’ve never been to Camp Nou, not yet. But my dream remains. One day, I’ll walk into that stadium, feel the roar of the crowd, and finally see in person what I fell in love with all those years ago on a small TV screen in Nepal.
People ask me why I love a club so far away. I tell them it’s simple: you don’t choose your first love—your heart does. And mine chose FC Barcelona.

For almost a decade, Barcelona was the football club of the purist. Led by its unassuming superstars, the team was hailed not just for its sporting achievements, but its artistry. It was an era of talent, technical elegance, and complete reverence for the football.
Those days are long gone.
You can trace the metamorphosis back several years. Perhaps as far back as the days of Luis Enrique, whose reign saw an emergence of direct football, spearheaded by MSN; Messi, Suárez and Neymar. Under subsequent managers we saw variations on the theme. Ernesto Valverde’s team took on a rugged, pragmatic demeanour. Quique Setién, trying to reverse the trend, only created confusion and contradiction.
But it wasn’t until Ronald Koeman arrived, and Lionel Messi departed, that the flame was truly extinguished.
Barcelona were at home to Granada. 1–0 down in the 82nd minute, accompanied by whistles from the outraged Camp Nou, the Dutch manager pioneered his own forward trident: Gerard Piqué, Ronald Araújo and Luuk de Jong. The ball was flung hopefully into the box, and Barca’s goliaths did whatever it took to bludgeon the ball into the net.
The purists wept. Their club was unrecognisable.
The Ronald Koeman era is over, but the scars remain. On Sunday, against Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona attempted a ludicrous 40 crosses, and ended the game with a front line of Luuk de Jong and Ronald Araújo. Ironically, this happened under the stewardship of the crown prince of ‘tiki taka’ himself, Xavi Hernández.
How did it come to this?
Perhaps there’s method to this madness, or more likely, it’s a symptom of the team’s serious deficiencies. To shed light, let’s examine Xavi’s rebuild project and identify why exactly this is happening, and what the alternatives might be going forward.
Let’s start with the diagnosis.
Forget about ‘tiki taka’ for a moment, or any other fabricated label. Xavi’s goal as Barcelona coach is to reintroduce positional play. A philosophy developed chiefly by Johan Cruyff. It’s a cerebral way of seeing the game, based on angles and distances between players, creation of triangles, instinctive movement. Cruyff claims it took ‘10,000 hours of training to finally reach the level of the Dream Team’. Mastery takes years.
We are seeing only the genesis of Xavi’s version, but it’s clear already that he wants to be a little more expansive than his predecessors. More switches of play, more direct passes, more crosses. As long as the space and movement allows it.
Xavi wants to stretch the opposition and exploit space quickly. To punish teams that stay compact by attacking the wide areas. It has worked. Barca have scored 57 goals in 32 games. Astonishingly, 40% of those open play goals have come from wide crosses.
So what’s the problem? Well, scoring from wide positions is one thing. When Barca have the game under control, there are signs they are acclimatising to the new philosophy. The faults appear when they are losing. When the opponents defend stubbornly and the clock is ticking down.
This is the recipe for a different type of crossing game. One that abandons positional play and ball circulation for low-percentage, high-volume balls into the box. This isn’t a considered approach. It’s a knee-jerk reaction. A response from a team, and a coach, that has no solution to a problem. And it happens for three reasons:
1. Opponents defend deep, with numbers
In each of Barca’s last three defeats, the opponent has finished the game with the same system: 5–4–1. They defend deep, in numbers, with very little space between the lines.
It is the kryptonite for any possession-based team. A nightmare to break down.
Pep Guardiola, another Cruyff disciple from whom Xavi has taken a lot of inspiration, has spent much of his career facing such dilemmas. It took years for him to develop a blueprint. Working from scratch, with an inherited squad, Xavi hasn’t cracked the code. Not yet.
2. Barca’s attack is one dimensional
In this first edition of ‘XaviBall’, Barcelona attack almost entirely down the flanks. Combinations through the centre are limited, largely because of the positions of attacking midfielders (the ‘interiors’). Rather than patrolling the centre, Barca’s interiors stay high and wide. Pedri and Frenkie de Jong are typically closer to the centre forward than they are to the pivot, Sergio Busquets.
Unfortunately, when the opponents nullify Barca’s width, they do not have a practiced alternative. Instead of looking for space in other areas, they double down on the wings, usually with the arrival of Adama Traoré. And the cycle of crossing begins.
3. The squad is limited
None of this is entirely Xavi’s fault. Take a look at the squad and you realise it’s missing a few crown jewels. Centre forward is a particularly barren. While Aubameyang is an excellent goal scorer, he is no creator. His impotence during buildup seriously limits Barca’s attack. Aubameyang has, time after time, lost the ball when it goes into his feet. Attacking through the middle becomes futile.
What the squad does have is two very direct, very effective crossing wingers: Ousmane Dembélé and Adama Traoré. It also has two imperious aerial threats, Luuk de Jong and centre back Ronald Araújo.
Together, these are the ingredients for ‘cross and hope’. Stubborn opponents, no ‘Plan B’ and a deficient squad.
The question for Xavi is obvious. What changes next season?
The solutions to these problems are not easy. But they are simple. Do these three things, and the demons of desperation will be exorcised for good. They are:
Solution 1: Prepare the team more thoroughly for deep, compact defences.
This requires time, patience and above all maturity. To some players it might seem counter-intuitive to take an extra touch, or look for an extra pass, rather than throw the ball into a dangerous area. But composure is crucial, and it has to be learned.
Solution 2: Improve the squad in key positions.
Particularly with a centre forward who can bring another dimension to Barca’s attack. Right back will also be important, to reduce reliance on Dembélé (should he stay) on that side.
Solution 3: Take the emphasis away from winning, and focus on performance.
This might sound controversial. But it’s the mentality that separates Xavi, a relative rookie, from a veteran like Pep Guardiola. Xavi’s language is ‘must-win’. Guardiola says ‘we play our game’. When you take away the pressure of the final result, and focus on executing your game plan, you develop a culture that’s resilient to wins or losses. One that doesn’t rush, or become desperate. You create the conditions for a long-term successful project.
With Xavi’s tenure still in its infancy, and some important transfer windows on the horizon, much can change in the near future for Barcelona. Only months ago this was a sinking ship; now some holes have been plugged. It’s going to take a lot more hard work, and disappointing performances, before we set course for something special. We’re nowhere near Cruyff’s 10,000 hours.
Regardless of a few deficiencies, or blind spots in the system, this is a project that demands time and support.
Given both of those things, the purists will return. And Barcelona will be recognisable again.
Thanks for reading, be sure to leave a ‘clap’ if you enjoyed, so I can keep making more Barcelona content!

Originally posted on alexrawlings.co.uk
A few days before my big move to Barcelona, I found myself talking to my now ex-colleague, Jesús. It was late at night, and we were on the Gatwick Express, heading into Victoria on our way back from the Polyglot Conference in Slovenia. Jesús is from Valencia, and so he took a particular interest in my decision to move to Spain. He asked me if I already had any friends in Barcelona.
“Yes,” I said, quickly. “Lots of friends. So many people, from all over the world. I know all of them.” There was a pause, which I interrupted to re-emphasise: “I have lots of friends.”
“OK,” Jesús replied, cautiously. “Just that I know you know lots of people, but just in case you need anything, my sister’s been living in Barcelona for years now, and she lives very close to where you’re going to be, so if you ever need anything just give her a call.”
I was taken aback. Not only was this so incredibly kind and thoughtful of Jesús to suggest, but the reality is that whenever you move to a new country, you never really know as many people as you think. There are fleeting connections that come and go, occasional numbers exchanged at meet-up groups, people you get on with who then mysteriously leave the country without saying a word… Knowing somebody who actually lived there, permanently, and was from there was like finding water in the desert. I graciously accepted.
The next day, a TV crew from the Catalan News Station TV3 had come to find me at work in London and shoot a short interview about why I was moving to Barcelona. When I met them at reception, the journalist greeted me in Catalan. I then turned to greet the cameraman in Catalan too. He turned out to be from Madrid, and although he understood Catalan, he said he didn’t really speak it because, well, he was Spanish.
The journalist, Sergi Mulero, then told me that actually, although he was Catalan, he came from a Spanish speaking family in Catalunya as well. He’d learned Catalan at school and grew up bilingually, but actually, his first language was Spanish. That was that. We spent the rest of the morning speaking just Spanish.
The day I arrived in Barcelona, the main Catalan TV channel had been playing that report on repeat pretty much all day. When I logged into Twitter, I found hundreds of messages from people all across Catalunya welcoming me, thanking me for choosing them, and wishing me all the best.
That evening, I got a WhatsApp. It was Jesús. “My sister and her family have been watching you all day on Catalan TV, and they want to invite you to join them for lunch,” he said.
I got in touch with Jesús’s sister, Maria, and we messaged in Spanish and arranged to meet that Saturday at 2pm — lunchtime in Spain — by the newly refurbished Mercat Sant Antoni.
Needless to say, I got totally lost. After 20 minutes of walking in circles around the outside of the gigantic, €80 million crucifix that was the Mercant Sant Antoni, I received a phone call. It was Maria, asking where I was. I explained I had no idea, but that I was by one of the entrances. Eventually we found each other, and walked to the restaurant to meet her, her husband, their daughter and her godfather. After we finished greeting each other, Maria asked a question that nobody would ever ask in London.
“Pues ¿qué idioma vamos a hablar? So what language are we going to speak?”
I was taken aback. Weren’t we already speaking a language? Wasn’t it already decided? Every centimetre of my body began to fill with fear that they were going to ask me to speak English to them. How many times had that happened to me when living abroad? How many friendships had I started that turned out to just be glorified free English lessons? I groaned.
“Bueno, es que el idioma de nosotros es el catalán,” she explained while my head exploded. “Cuando salimos a comer los sábados, siempre hablamos en catalán. It’s just that our language is Catalan. When we go out to eat on Saturdays, we always speak in Catalan.”
My head was exploding for lots of reasons. The first, was that I knew Maria was from Valencia. When I lived in Valencia, I remembered distinctly that Catalan (or Valencian, as it’s known there) was always the elephant in every room. Everything — all street signs, all addresses, bus timetables, etc. — was always written in valencià, but nobody really spoke it. I remembered so clearly when I went to the town hall to register my existence in Spain, asking the civil servant behind the desk whether she spoke any Valencian.
“Nos obligan a aprenderlo en el colegio, pero… They force us to learn it at school, but…” she leaned closer, to whisper: “Nadie lo habla aquí. Ni palabra. Nobody speaks it here. Not even a word.”
The other reason was that I knew that although Jesús was very proud of Catalan and had done most of his school in it, he tended to speak Spanish. I’d just assumed that, like the presenter from TV3, he came from a Spanish speaking family.
“Si, és molt estrany. Yes, it’s very strange,” Maria said, switching to Catalan when I asked her about this. “En Jesús era sempre el meu germà castellanoparlant. Tots parlàvem català, i ell sempre contestava en castellà. Jesus was always my Spanish-speaking brother. We all spoke Catalan, and he always answered in Spanish.”
I told them that I loved Catalan, that I thought it was the most beautiful of all the Romance languages, the missing piece of the puzzle between Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese. But I apologised, explaining that although I wanted to learn more Catalan, I had just arrived and my spoken Catalan was weak. I asked them to please continue speaking Catalan as though I weren’t there, but that I would feel more comfortable expressing myself in Spanish.
Of course it was no problem, but as the conversation went on, everyone by default shifted into speaking Spanish. I felt terrible. I felt like that one annoying person at a group of internationals in Berlin who all spoke German but who kept saying “Could we just speak English please so everybody understands?” Forcing people to use a major world language instead of their beautiful ‘minority’ language so they could speak to me was certainly nowhere to be found on my list of things to do when I moved to Catalunya. Yet I’d just arrived, and that’s exactly what I was doing.
It was so lovely to meet Maria and her friends and family, and I really couldn’t have imagined a nicer way to start my new life in Barcelona. I had sudden flashback half way through to last time, when I was living in Valencia, and I used to go out to restaurants on a Saturday for lunch that were always packed full with huge tables of Spanish families and friends eating, drinking, talking and enjoying. I’d always observe them from the tiny table they’d put me on in the corner, thinking that I would never feel the same connection to this beautiful place that they did. I would always be an outsider, a permanent tourist, a guiri. Those thoughts are partly what took me back to the UK, convinced that really you had to live in your own country to be happy. Yet three years later, here I was sitting at the table, chatting away in Spanish and dishing out huge plates of arroz negro.
Yet I felt so bad about forcing everyone to speak Spanish, that I made a pact with myself. From now on, I was only going to use Catalan. Everywhere, and with everyone. Why not? After all, all the signs everywhere were almost always just in Catalan. In most cafés and restaurants you had to play this weird game where you’d decide what you want by reading the menu in Catalan, then translate it back into Spanish so that you could order it from the waiter. Why not make life easier for everyone and just speak Catalan to everyone instead?
Well, almost everyone that is.
Armed with my new Catalanophile confidence, my first target was the new Tim Hortons that had opened up near my house. I’d never heard of Tim Hortons, but apparently it was the place to go in Canada, which is why it made total sense for it to open just off Plaça de Catalunya in Barcelona, where, once again, every single word inside it from the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ signs on the doors to the list of coffees was written in Catalan.
I awaited my turn, and eventually was served.
“Hola, ¿qué te pongo? Hey, what can I get you?” I was asked, in Spanish.
“Bona tarda,” I replied proudly, in Catalan. “Em dones un cafè negre sisplau, i un donut de dolç de llet. Could I get a black coffee please and a dulce de leche donut.”
There was a silence. I had been concentrating so hard on remembering how to say dulce de leche in Catalan that I’d made the whole order focusing on the display case, without looking up. Clearly I had made some horrendous grammar mistake. Clearly I had used some kind of Castillian Spanish word. Something had happened. Something had gone wrong.
Eventually I looked up. As my eyes made their way up to meet dark circles of the man behind the till, they passed over a name badge.
First I saw the name ‘Eduardo’. Then I saw the Colombian flag next to it.
“Oh shit,” I thought.
“Molt bé,” he answered in perfect Catalan with the most beautiful Colombian accent. “És per aquí o per emportar? Is that to have here or take away?”

Barcelona conquered my heart 12 years ago. Since then I have known no other city that enchants me so much. She keeps her memories in the Gothic Quarter and Old Town, and exquisitely dresses up in the architecture of the Eixample.
I recall the words of one taxi driver in Valencia who, with a sigh of complaint, noted that his native city turned its back on the sea, while Barcelona faces the sea flirtatiously. Those who have been there can see the driver’s point.
Indeed, Barcelona was born under a lucky star. It started its growth from the seashore and developed as a port city. The sea predetermined not only its urban development, but also the spirit of Ciudad Condal — a free city, the seat of a county unto itself. It is artistic, independent and constantly changing.
Barcelona consistently irritated Francisco Franco, who espoused centralism and linguistic unification. The burden of dictatorship that constrained Catalan cultural self-identification and sidelined their ancestors’ language amounted to a straitjacket on Catalan identity. Once free, Catalonia erupted in national pride, gained autonomy and enacted widespread use of the Catalan language. Today, picking out a book in Spanish (Castellano) in a Barcelona bookstore can become a dizzying challenge for the eyes.
If you’ve been to Barcelona, you can’t fail to notice red-and-yellow Catalan flags hanging from some balconies, or black stickers with a donkey adjusted to a car bumper. These are the signs of Catalan self-identification. A driver from Madrid, on the other hand, would festoon his car with a sticker of an Osborne bull. This is the animal that witnessed a passionate coitus between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in the explicit movie Jamón, Jamón.
The relationship between Madrid and Barcelona reminds me of the relationship between Moscow and St Petersburg. There is an intrinsic rivalry between the two cities, which can be compared in terms of size, grandeur and cultural imprint.
Still, in my mind’s eye there is no place for competition between Madrid and Barcelona because I tend to view them as cities of the opposite sex. Barcelona sounds like a woman’s name and its architectural lines embody femininity; whereas Madrid manifests itself as a king and has a male energy. Would it not be laughable for a man and a woman to compare assets?
However, nobody would deny that it was not Madrid, but Barcelona that in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was a wellspring of artistic, bohemian and eccentric lifestyle in Spain. The Catalan capital was greatly influenced by Paris. In 1989 the Parallel avenue became famous for its own Moulin Rouge, the El Molino music hall. Another Parisian-like venue was a famous café, Els Cuatre Gats at carrer Montsió 3. It was opened by Pere Romeo, who had previously worked as a waiter and an entertainer in the cabaret Le Chat Noir in Paris. He timely sensed that Barcelona was lacking a tavern with affordably priced food and sounds of a piano. This place was bound to become legendary. The upper crust of the artistic world, namely Santiago Rusiñol, Ramón Casas, Pablo Picasso and Antonio Gaudí held their vibrant round tables there.
Els Cuatre Gats is still up and running. If you are willing to travel back to the early 20th century and see a place where creative ideas were born, you should definitely pin this café on your map.
To help you understand what makes me feel enchanted by Barcelona, I would like to share some of my favourite routes and spots. In my recommendations I will deliberately skip some of the most revered tourist locations.
To start with, I must confess that I loathe La Rambla. The reason is simple. It is overcrowded and has a precarious feel. If you are up for a long straight walk, instead of going down La Rambla toward the sea, turn around and head up the Rambla de Cataluña. This long boulevard is wrongly ignored by the touristic herds, who prefer to ransack numerous shops on Paseo de Gracia rather than peacefully explore the streets inhabited by genuine Catalans. You can see the essence of Barcelona life along the Rambla de Cataluña. There are families with strollers passing by, senior gray-haired couples sitting on the benches, loud groups of friends drinking cañas or eating tapas in the street cafes.
Merging with locals doesn’t exclude the opportunity to do some shopping. Don’t miss Muji, Jo Malone or Zara Home. But the foremost highlight of this boulevard is the elegant architecture of the buildings. Be ready to have a sore neck as you will constantly feel the need to look upward. Soon enough, your long walk will be rewarded with an imposing view of Tibidabo mountain. This name comes from the Latin, meaning “I will give to you”. These were the words that the Devil said to Jesus Christ, trying to tempt Him in the desert with all the riches of the world — and what greater riches could there be, one should think, than the seducing skyline of Barcelona?
Our Savior turned down the diabolical offering. But we, trespassers and sinners, should not refrain from enjoying the breathtaking view of the city. And we should also visit the Temple of the Sacred Heart atop Tibidabo, crowned with a monumental figure of Jesus Christ.
Due to its distance from the city center, Tibidabo is not considered as a main attraction. But I would strongly recommend you to take a bus or a taxi and see the beauty of Barcelona from here, almost from Heaven. I will concede, of course, that Sagrada Familia is a masterpiece beyond human conception, where you will witness a triumph of life, but here in the Temple of the Sacred Heart you will get all that plus a unique feeling of hovering over the city.
In order to feel Barcelona’s heart beating, one should go to Diagonal. Despite its proximity to Paseo de Gracia, this long and important artery is almost free from tourists. Instead of casually dressed foreigners you will see business-like, formally dressed Catalans, who hurriedly park their Vespas along the road and rush to their offices.
As a driver, I prefer to avoid this avenue because of the traffic and frequency of traffic lights, but as a pedestrian, I value this street a lot. I love its architectural attire: the splendid façades and ascending perpendicular streets, Muntaner and Aribau, which lead to Vía Augusta. These streets shape one of the city’s most affluent neighborhoods — Sant Gervasi. Its residents are doctors, professors, lawyers and businessmen. You can see them during their morning walks with their dogs in the tiny lovely Parc Turó or in the nearby cafes enjoying a café cortado or café solo and reading El Periódico on the weekends.
If you are hungry and tempted to try traditional tapas, I know a place that you would like. Cervercería Catalana reflects the easygoing nature of Barcelona — it takes good care of its visitors, but not at the expense of the locals, so be ready to rub elbows with the white collars who come here for lunch. If you choose to munch between 13.30 and 15, you will have to wait for approx. 15 minutes to be seated. But if you come alone, don’t miss the chance to get a place at the bar. Apart from the so-much-talked-about tapas you will face an abundance of fresh seafood and seasonal vegetables on the counter. Don’t be shy, point your finger at whatever raw ingredient you find attractive and in 5–10 minutes you will have it, cooked in the Spanish way. Take advantage of the menu of the day. During the weekdays it includes rice of the day (arroz del día). If you come in good company, bear in mind the Spanish tradition of sharing food, when all the plates with different tapas are placed in the middle of the table. This custom (para compartir) is not only generous but also very useful, as you are allowed to indulge in a symphony of various flavours.
Speaking of tapas, here is an interesting fact. Nowadays it is not a common sight, but 10 years ago you could rate the quality of a bar by the quantity of crumpled napkins thrown under the bar counter. Imagine yourself drinking a glass of wine or a pint of beer, savouring morsels of tapas, wiping your fingers with napkins and throwing them down. For a passerby, a floor covered with paper would be the best advertising campaign.
In tapas bars I prefer to skip the deserts and treat myself to un carajillo con Baileys — a small glass of coffee with Bailey’s Irish Cream. Let me end Part I on that sweet note…

Originally published on alexrawlings.co.uk
It was a very simple move. A short, 90 minute hop across the length of France, down over the Pyrenees, and into my new home. Into Barcelona.
I had tried to throw almost everything away. I’d spent the week before the big day hauling huge bags of old clothes, books, unused kitchen equipment and anything that could weigh me down out to the recycling centre. I’d narrowed my life down to just two suitcases and the iMac I’d bought in Budapest. That was everything I packed onto that small plane that morning and brought with me into my new life.
There was nobody to greet me as I walked out of arrivals pushing my trolley. A sea of strangers, waiting for friends and relatives. I walked past them, pushing my life on a single trolley, and headed for the taxi rank.
I made my way to the front of the queue and greeted the taxi driver in Spanish.
“Hola, buenas.” I pointed at my bags. “Te pido disculpas, porque llevo toda mi vida aquí, y tendremos que ponerla toda en tu coche. You’ll have to forgive me, because I have my whole life with me here, and we’re going to have to fit all of it in your taxi.”
“Buenas,” he replied. “Eso es toda tu vida? Qué guay. Qué honor. Pues la ponemos por detrás. This is your whole life? Wow. What an honour. Let’s put it all in the boot.”
We drove off along the motorway towards the city over the turquoise horizon. The taxi driver was keen to talk. He asked me if I had so many things with me because I was moving to Barcelona. I told him I was. He asked me what I was going to do here. I coughed.
This was the question that I’d spent so long trying to avoid answering. The fact was I didn’t really have a clear idea. I had dreams, I had some plans, I had some projects, and I’d come to Barcelona because I thought this would finally be the place where I could get to work on them.
Because how do you tell somebody that one day you just woke up and knew you had to go? That you went into work and sat down with your manager and gave her your notice? You put your room up for rent, closed your bank accounts, and booked a one way ticket. Then a few weeks later, you just went.
No, you didn’t know what you were going to. But you knew that you’d never felt any urge as strong as this ever before in your life, and so for the very first time you stopped listening to everybody else, and started listening to yourself. And because you’d done that, you knew everything would be alright.
“I’m a journalist,” I told him. “I write feature pieces about languages, cultures and intercultural communication.” That’s what I’d told the BA cabin crew at Heathrow that morning when I was trying to persuade them to let me take my iMac into the cabin with me. It had worked.
The driver wasn’t really interested, because what he really wanted to talk about was chestnuts. Chestnuts, he told me, were an important symbol for life. They reconnected us with nature, with fate, and they brought us luck.
He grew chestnuts, he told me, but not just any chestnuts, lucky chestnuts: castañas de la suerte. He told me that whenever I needed some luck or inspiration, I should just take one of his chestnuts into my hand and squeeze it tight, and that fate would smile upon me.
As he started listing all the Spanish celebrities I’d never heard of who’d been in his taxi and held his chestnuts, I thought that was exactly what I needed at this point in my life: a bit of luck.
I looked at his measly chestnuts in their cheap cardboard boxes. I knew it was a scam, but I decided I was going to buy one anyway.
Soon, the motorway gave way to the elegant, multicoloured avenues of Barcelona. The billboards that had been offering to fly me back to London for €19,99 had turned into wrought iron balconies, draped with Catalan independence flags and yellow ribbons.
The afternoon sun began to dance through the autumnal leaves of the trees that lined the street. I suddenly realised that the driver had stopped talking about chestnuts.
“I’m very Catalan,” he said. “I love my country, I love my language, and I love my people.” As we drew up to a red light, he turned around to face me. “Pero yo no me muero por ninguna bandera. But I’m not going to die for any flag.” He let that hang for a moment in the air.
The lights turned green and we drove on, past another sea of Catalan flags. Each one seemed bigger, longer, and stripier than the last.
I told him, in Catalan, that I wanted to learn better Catalan. This delighted him, and he immediately stopped speaking Spanish.
“Everyone who lives in Barcelona should learn Catalan”, he told me. “Everyone complains that Catalans are very reclusive and hard to get to know, but how on earth do people coming here expect to integrate if they won’t even learn our language?”
“Lots of foreigners come here to learn Spanish and then complain that everything is written in our language. There are so many cities in the world that speak Spanish, and just one that speaks Catalan. Why do they come here? If they don’t like it here, why don’t they go to Toledo or Valladolid or somewhere else?”
Because they don’t really come here to learn Spanish or Catalan, I thought. They come here primarily for the beach. There’s no beach in Toledo.
Eventually we arrived. My new front door was a gigantic glass and iron structure that gushed with natural light from the busy street into the ornate entranceway of my building.
I told the driver I wanted to buy a chestnut. His face looked like Catalunya had just been given independence and granted a permanent seat on the UN Security Council all in the same afternoon.
He helped me lift my possessions out onto the street, and plonked my largest suitcase directly into the path of a passing hipster with perfect designer stubble. He stumbled over it. “Welcome, tourist,” he muttered in English.
I started looking for the right doorbell to ring when suddenly the door was opened by a tall, thin guy with curly black hair and an Argentinian accent. I realised this was the person who was in the process of moving out of the room I was moving into. He had some bad news.
“El ascensor no va. Tendrás que subir las escaleras. The lift is out. You’re going to have to take the stairs.”
It was almost a very simple move. But even the slog of lifting 65 kilos worth of possessions up five flights of stairs was made beautiful by the ornate tiles that lined every step of the way.
As I collapsed into the sofa of my new living room and enjoyed the final rays of sunlight of the afternoon streaming through the double balcony doors, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I had done it. I live in Barcelona now. And I couldn’t be happier.

From a small town of Jharkhand to an international tourist spot, home of “FC Barcelona”. A Solo travel to foreign land to end up meeting lovely people and finding soul brothers. It was an amazing time that I spent in Spain. Hence to give my respect and acknowledgment to everyone who was part of my travel is my responsibility, hence I am writing this article.
This was an important event in my life as I had always wanted that my first international travel would have some meaning to it and not just a recreational event. Hence, I was thrilled when I first new about the travel. My wife can tell you about the excitement I had the day I told her.
I am breaking this article in following parts.
Requesting the travel
Like every regular Tuesday, I was with my Boss for the weekly update. While I was giving the updates, we focused on the team we ramped up in BCN. It was about 8 months and we were seeing great results; however, I expressed the concern of not being able to connect with them at the level I do with my team here in India. Even though we used all modern method to meet and try to connect, there was always hit and miss and that kept me thirsty.
Suddenly I heard — “You should go meet them” I did not understand it at first and then he said it will be good if you visit the BCN office and meet the guys. Well! my soul was jumping and dancing but outside I kept the composure and said, Sure.
Passport and the Visa
Now you will know the reason, why I kept a separate section dedicated to Passport and visa. My passport had expired in 2016. I never got the urge to renew it just to use it as an ID for taking loan or filling any form. However, I had made a resolution at the beginning of 2019 that I will get my passport renewed. Hence, I applied for renewal, booked a slot, went to passport office. After step 2 I was sent to meet the passport office manager, she abruptly asked me for my educational certificate. I asked why, she said go write an application that you don’t need a passport showing you are educated, I was shocked — what? I asked. She responded your old passport is of type — “ECR category” and while renewing it if you don’t submit your 10th certificate we will issue the same. I did not know a thing about it. However, I read and found I would never get work visa for any country. Hence, I took another slot and went again, and all was okay.
I received my passport but my police verification was not yet done, so the dude turns up to my house and asks for all kinds of documents and as soon as he sees my old passport was from Jharkhand, He immediately asked for even more documentation — I showed him the new passport too, that I have received it. Unfortunately, my police verification failed.
After I raised and escalation, I received a call from passport office to whom I explained everything, but the person was supposedly trained to give time slot and he did that perfectly- only thing he forgot to tell that I was not supposed to go to same visa office but to the regional head office. Anyways the security guard at the passport office told me that I was in wrong place and hence I reached the regional passport office and after being in the queue got to meet the passport officer. After I explained her everything, she showed that she was upset with the “dude” but then smiled and said the “dude” wants to verify your nationality. Thanks to my call center background I almost uttered “WTF”. I was expecting that she would reject the “dude’s” rejection and approve my passport however she sent my application for police verification again. I smiled at her and said, that same “dude” will come to verify, and she said it’s the process.
That’s the time when I googled how to bribe someone.
Finally, I had passport successfully approved by police. Yay! And my boss just told me to go international…
For couple of days I was just thinking and then I spoke with a colleague cum friend cum mentor about it, the next min I got the details of whom to contact for tickets and an introductory email to Visa agency.
Went through the visa agency as it was my first experience and did not want to get bounced around, we picked up a date and booked the tickets. Collected all the documents and prepared my application. Took an appointment for visa document submission and went.
I was before time and the office was empty — only the security guard and the application collector but he is a guy of ethics and made me wait till my slot time came. Then I was called and asked for my documents. Looking at those properly listed documents, he rejected it and gave me a new list of documents. Supposedly they needed 1 year of bank statement and 6 months of salary slip and many more for a 7 days visa. I was taken aback, he gave me another slot and I could not make it in that time. I went the next day and he was furious as to how can I simply walk in. lol the office was very busy with me, the guard and him. Still he called me the next day — I had to.
To my surprise before the 7th day EOB, I got my passport with an approved visa on it.
The Flight
My Flight was in morning to Dubai and then to Barcelona. I reached airport early and checked in, bought a book, eat breakfast and finally acted reading!
The gates opened and I boarded the flight, Woah! Emirates is awesome that’s the voice I heard within me. Reached my seat and settled. Watched movies and when the hostess came, I denied the food only to realize that it was free (already paid for). Well there’s the second flight to compensate! Ting…
I reached Dubai, Connections this way please, connections this way please… If ever I will have memory flashes like Jason Bourne, I am sure this would be part of it… The red connection boards, everyone walking fast and different faces. Kept pace and suddenly a gate opened I was hurried in a bus. I reached next gate and funny thing happened with me. I had two extra hours in between but the time difference confused me and the display boards.
The display boards in Dubai airport has an extra column, it’s the last column that tells you how many min it will take for you to reach the gate from the place where the board is. With so much of hustle and time difference playing at the back of my mind, I thought that column was for the time the flight goes and it showed 6 mins for my flight. Again, I said “WTF” and ran, don’t judge right now… I had to.
I reached the gate, it was closed. Damn! Not a single “May I help you” but many shops. Okay I said to myself and went to the restroom as it was more urgent than missing the flight. After I was done and was relaxed, I guess the brain started functioning and I realized that I have almost two hours before the flight goes. Then I was like why it would say 6 min on the board and then I looked at the closest display board and it said 2 min. Now I knew the reason why they have added the extra column.
Now mind at peace I sat near the gate and as the boarding started, I joined the queue and Holy mother of god what is this, a flight or a hotel! Emirates is super awesome…
I enjoyed the flight and compensated for the miss too 😉
Brothers and the day out
After Immigration check I went out and waited near the conveyor belt to collect my bag, spoke with family and ting! I got a message. It said “Ravi, Waiting opposite your exit in a restaurant white tree in front of, Welcome to Europe”
As I walked out, I saw a huge man standing with my name, I waved, and he saw. With all smiles we met I tried to shake hands and he hugged. Then pointed towards another huge guy with a baseball cap. We waved too.
The two huge guys were Robert Woschee and Andre Ruckner. It did not feel as if we were meeting for first time, it was an instant connection. We sat for 5 mins and then walked out. Rob had everything planned. We took taxi and reached hotel. We decided to meet at the restaurant for dinner after freshening up and we did. We spoke about work and Andre gave some special gifts. We bonded over dinner and I got to know more about Germany. We also planned about Monday day-out and realized we all were too tired to stay up any longer and we moved towards the room, In the lift we decided to make a WhatsApp groups to plan things.
Morning, we met at the restaurant had a nice Spanish breakfast and then waited for the taxi, as it was a holiday, we could not find a taxi hence the reception called for it. We three then reached the place called the plaza to start our city tour. Rob the planner had things sorted out and the two little brothers tagged along. We clicked photos and looked around, the tour was voice guided and to my surprise there was a Hindi channel too. While listening to the guide and watching the beautiful city of Barcelona I noticed couple of things that stood out for me.
The graffiti, the Catatonias flags and the medieval architecture. The city has a major impact of graffiti culture, most of the wall, shop shutters and different object were having graffiti some cool ones and some not worthy to look at.
The architecture is a mix of modern and medieval times, the “la sagrada familia” is so fascinating that I had to get down and walk around to see it up close. Its mesmerizing to see the beauty in the complex design. This is where we bought our ESPANA plates and the cool hats. I met some Urdu speaking vendor and I mistook him of being an Indian, he was a Pakistani. My first ever encounter with a Pakistan resident — they look, feel and speak the same.
My reaction intrigued Andre and he was interested to know the history of India and Pakistan, we parked this discussion for later and continued our city tour clicking photos. We felt a little twitch in our belly and there Rob was already taking the Sausages out from his magical bag! The German Sausages, it gave us enough energy to continue our trip and was tasty too. While we chewed on the sausages, we saw the beautiful beaches, the buildings and lovely people.
We had lot of fun and made great rapport between three of us. Here you see, Andre’s reaction to the sausages just to tease Rob! While we reached the plaza, we were looking for a place to hog.
WhatsApp was full of messages from Danny, Maik and Ahcene as we were planning to meet the whole team in the evening, and we decided to look for the best place that served Paella.
We were back in our rooms by late afternoon and rested so we could reach the place Dan found. I was excited and had my fears too, dressed up and checked my cards. Prayed a bit to god to make my Amex work 😉 — The experience with shops and Amex in HYD is sad hence needed god'ss help.
The boys, the office and the Quarter end
Cheriff was the fancy place that serves Paella, we reached about 7ish and by now I could experience the German side of punctuality. Generally, I am always before time but oh! Boy the dudes from Germany are too good.
Maik, Dan and Ahcene are seriously fit, I realized as they welcomed us into the restaurant. We hugged and made noise. The football rivals could see each other eye to eye. I could only image 100 ways how Andre could squish Dan. Seeing the boys live was a totally a different experience when compared to a video call. While I was enjoying the moment, Ahcene was busy folding his bicycle as the waiter pointed it was not safe to park the bike outside, next min the bike was folded into a wheel and kept in one corner!
I got a message, Bhai it’s a baby girl. It was Nand from Hyderabad. I shared this beautiful message with all, and we made a congratulations video and sent it to Nand. He told me he was so happy to receive the message from all of us when I was back in HYD. After a stomach full of seafood and beer, we walked out. Making jokes and getting to know each other a little more. Ahcene is not always busy, he smiles and laughs too. Finally, we called it a day and came back to rest enough. So, we could get to office on time.
Next morning met Rob and Andre in the busy hotel lobby, grabbed the breakfast and walked to the office. As we entered, we were welcomed by the German presales team. The handsome Dennis and cool looking Axel were too warm and as we settled the rest of the team appeared.
The office was so well placed. Adam was in his den as we met him and discussed about some of the IT requirements, which was simple enough for him to take care off. As Kai walked in, we greeted and hugged, and he went in his corner to do the magic he does with the product.
I met all the ladies (Names not mentioned) and the dudes, it was little scary for me as Spain is all about kisses and hugs. somehow, I managed and thanks to all the ladies for being kind to me. Everyone @ BCN office is a sweetheart. If ever I get an opportunity I would run to work from that office or would recreate the magic at home.
The rest of the day, I spent talking to the boys and saw Andre’s magic in action. Ahcene was stuck to his chair did calls after calls. Dan discussed many things and arranged things for us. Maik had Rob and Andre next to him. We had a team meeting and discussed things about work and what is expected from each other. I took notes of things that could make their life easier.
Now was the time I met Nathalie. A charismatic personality and such a loving person, unfortunately there was a client at risk and that was the point of our discussion. Later I got a ping from her about how easy it was to knock out the challenge for us being under one roof. I wish, I responded.
Later after office we went with few of the BCN folks to a local joint, it was Nat’s kind gesture to welcome us and meet the rest of the team. The place was small, specially when you look at Rob, Andre and me but the place was all love and food. Superb evening came to end as I met Mr. Challenge. He is bundle of energy and too much emotions. All he wants is the best for all. I understood he had some unanswered questions so deflected his comments for our formal meeting and a friend helped 😊.
Next days were filled with one on ones with Sales/Presales spearheads. We discussed various things, and everyone was able to acknowledge the improvement in support from past two years since we started. I noted the areas to work on and explained few work flows, also discussed about how different a support conversation is than of a sales conversation with clients. The reason why there are needs for logs more than once or twice. Thanks to my discussion with Rob and Andre, which helped in establishing that East Germany is difficult to handle for locals too.
Meeting Nat and Lorena was very informative as we exchanged our processes. I believe our teams can complement each other more going forward.
Fortunately, former office was next door and it was sweet meeting an old friend — Osarabo. We had lunch together at Tito’s and remembered the old days and he brought great memories of Joshi (Joe) and Me, as what a symphony it used to be working with us. Thanks to Osarabo and Rob for cherishing those days.
Friday was the last day at BCN office and it was the last day of quarter too. The office is mostly full of sales and presales folks and it was amazing to see everyone in action. I can say I have witnessed awesomeness and the Pizza party too.
Again, hugs and kisses but by now I was used to it. Next time around I will be the master of the art. Before I end this chapter, here is one person who brought the BCN office to life. Tony a beard man and happy soul. You would find him as you enter the office and his energy is infectious, he will energize you while you enter to have an outstanding day — amazing member of the team.
Time to say bye.
As we traveled back to airport. I dropped Andre and Rob at their entry gate, we hugged. Suddenly I felt heavy, something was stuck in my chest and eyes were all watery. Crazy I am a tough guy as I mumbled, not sure why the freak water droplets rolled down my cheeks.
Last five days were so lovely and engaging, it felt like I was with my brothers and parting away was causing pain. That’s life I said and swallowed the lump while walking inside the airport. Next min I got a message, Ravi are you alright? the freaky water droplets came back. Yes, I replied.
This pic cheered me up and I was happy travelling back home.

On the 30th March 2022 at the Camp Nou, one of football’s great amphitheatres, Barcelona defeated their eternal foes, but new rivals in the women’s game, Real Madrid 5–2 in the second leg of their Women’s Champions League Quarter Final in front of a modern record crowd of 91,553. To capture a little bit of history I loaded up a cheap one-shot 35mm camera with some black and white film and got clicking.
Here’s a selection of some of the shots taken across the evening with a couple of bloopers at the end because having just one shot at it means that sometimes the stories the eyes see and the pictures the camera take can be very different.
Camera: Reto Ultrawide // Film: Ilford HP5 Plus 35mm
The modern record set that evening would be broken just a few weeks later. The venue would be the same. The manner of victory for Barcelona, this time against German side Wolfsburg, would be just as emphatic, a 5–1 victory setting the table for a 5–3 aggregate victory that would take them to the final.
There were 91,600 fans on April 23rd 2022. As women’s football continues to flourish the records will continue to tumble.
IF YOU LIKED THIS: If you enjoyed this I have set up a Ko Fi page, if you want to, and you are able to, I’d love your support. The link to do so is here and it can be whatever you want.
Thanks for reading, stay safe and be back soon and as promised here’s a couple of extras just to say thank you for sticking with me to the end.

July. That was the last time I was in Barcelona. I was on vacation with A & M. First time for them; definitely not the first for me. I can barely remember how many times I have been in town: so many times that I can formally nominate Barcelona my third home-town, after Milan and London. I speak the language, I am familiar with the places, I simply feel at home.
Next week I am supposed to be in Barcelona, one more time. I will chair a conference and I have some personal business. I truly hope that everything will be resolved peacefully, that the vote will take place smoothly and that Spain will give local population the right to choose their destiny.

In this series of articles, I will take you behind the scenes of my global adventures conducting executive programs and delivering keynote presentations. Join me as I share my most entertaining and often humorous stories from my decades on the road. You can subscribe to ensure you never miss an article.
Between 1987 and 1988, I spent about one week every month in Barcelona, Spain, consulting for a company that was implementing my multi-track program for corporate transformation. On average, I stayed in that city about five days every month, conducting my programs for about 250 managers and executives in that company.
Typically, on a Monday evening every month, after teaching my afternoon doctoral seminar at the University of Pittsburgh, I would fly from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, where my British Airways plane would then pick up some additional passengers before continuing on its direct flight to London. Once I arrived in London and went through customs, I would then take a flight to Barcelona on Iberia Airlines. Several days later, usually on Saturday of that same week, I would then reverse my trusty route that brought me there in order to travel back to Pittsburgh, so I could again teach my doctoral seminar on Monday afternoon as well as attend to my other university responsibilities during the rest of the week.
As noted, I followed this same routine, once a month, for almost two years. In addition, since I was taking that long, cross-Atlantic trip to Europe, I often extended my stay and traveled to other nearby countries in order to deliver additional keynote presentations or conduct some other top-management programs — before returning to Pittsburgh. It seemed I was constantly “on the road again,” as melodically captured in Willie Nelson’s famous song of that same title.
During my two-year consulting project in Barcelona, the senior executives of that company would occasionally ask me to deliver a presentation or workshop to a group of executives from other companies in Spain in order to inspire those other Spanish companies to also proceed with corporate transformation. The goal was to encourage all those Spanish companies (and Spain as a whole) to become more competitive with their counterparts in other European nations. In fact, in 1986, Spain joined the “European Communities” (12 countries in total at that time), which would later become the European Union in 1993, after the fall of communism and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was clear to me that many Spanish companies knew they had to transform their way of doing business in order to succeed in a much larger — unified — European marketplace.
On one particular occasion, the CEO of that Barcelona company asked me to present my approach to transforming organizations to about 50 distinguished senior executives from other Spanish companies who were already successful inside Spain, but were concerned just how well their organizations would fare when they had to complete with other European companies. Not surprisingly, such an important program had to be planned many months in advance in order to coordinate the travel schedules of those very busy senior executives. To do justice to the anticipated importance of my presenting a completely integrated program for achieving long-term organizational success, the chosen venue for this program was a fancy resort hotel on the top of a mountain, just outside the city of Barcelona. I was absolutely delighted to have been given this opportunity to further extend the reach of my work to several more organizations in Spain — in such a beautiful setting.
I scheduled my usual flights from Pittsburgh to Barcelona. A private car would then meet me at the Barcelona airport and transport me to that mountain-top resort. I was especially looking forward to this exciting adventure, not realizing that simply getting there would be much more demanding than I could ever have imagined beforehand.
When it was time for me to take this special trip to Spain, there was a snowstorm already taking place on the East Coast of the U.S. Since my flights were neither canceled nor delayed, I proceeded on my journey. However, when my Pittsburgh flight was descending on its assigned runway at the Philadelphia International Airport, my plane grazed a service van that had lost its way, due to the blistering snow that had been falling for several hours. Even though we landed safely (after experiencing a huge jolt just before we touched down on the runway), the plane was damaged in the incident and therefore could not continue on its scheduled flight to London. Moreover, there were currently no available planes to take the place of the damaged one. The remainder of my flights to London and Barcelona, therefore, were officially cancelled.
Once all us passengers departed the damaged plane, I checked the flight schedules in the airport lounge: There were no more flights to London that evening. The next flight from Philadelphia to London wouldn’t depart until the next evening. But I had to be in Barcelona tomorrow, since my presentation to those 50 Spanish executives was scheduled to take place the following morning in that mountain-top resort. If I waited for the next flight to London from Philadelphia (tomorrow evening), I wouldn’t arrive in Barcelona in time to attend my own presentation.
In my mind, there was no way I could miss that executive meeting on the mountain top just outside of Barcelona, which had been arranged six months earlier. I had to be there. Period. If that special event did not take place as scheduled, it would be especially disappointing (perhaps even embarrassing) for the Barcelona company that was sponsoring my presentation for those executives from several other companies.
As such, I was in desperate need of a Plan B.
After waiting on a long line to speak to an airport concierge, I learned that there was only one possible way through my current predicament: As it turned out, British Airways did have a flight the next morning at 9 am, which would get me to London the same day, so I could take a later flight from there to Barcelona and still arrive in the evening. But there was a catch: That morning flight to London did not depart from the Philadelphia International Airport (as I already knew from the evening before) but was scheduled to depart from the JFK International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City … which was more than 100 miles from my current location.
Basically, proceeding with Plan B, I would first have to rent a car and drive — through a snowstorm — to arrive at JFK Airport in Jamaica, Queens, by early morning. Ordinarily, the driving time would be about 2 hours between the two airports. But with the bad weather, it was hard to say how much additional time would be needed for my drive to New York City. However, it was now 9:00 pm in the evening, so there would not be any traffic jams on the road going north, other than what slowdowns might occur from the storm. Since I had to arrive in Barcelona tomorrow (so I could deliver my presentation the very next morning), it seemed I had no other choice.
More specifically, that flight to London was scheduled to depart from JFK at 9:00 am in the morning, New York Time, which was 2:00 pm in the afternoon, London Time. That flight was scheduled to arrive at 6:00 pm in the evening, London Time. Doing the math, given those departure and arrival times (taking into account the 1-hour difference in time zone) suggested a four-hour flight. But I knew very well that it usually takes about 8 hours to fly from New York to London, with an average jet speed of about 600 miles per hour. Yet British Airlines was offering that same flight in half the time? Naturally, I asked the concierge: “How is this flight time even possible?”
The concierge then informed me that the Concorde (a supersonic jet that can travel more than 1200 miles per hour) would be making the flight, which would only take half of the usual flight time. Naturally, I (or rather my client) had to pay for the difference in airline fees (since the Concorde flight was much more expensive). But for the time being, money was no object in this adventure: I had to be in Barcelona in time for my presentation! Once I made the reservation for the Concorde (and paid the extra fee), I phoned my contact person in Spain who was coordinated all my educational programs there. I let him know that I would keep him abreast of any changes in my travel schedule. But if everything worked as planned, he would pick me up at the Barcelona airport and drive me straightaway to that mountain-top resort.
After I picked up my one suitcase in the baggage claim area, a service van took me to the airport rental car place. It was now about 10:45 pm in the evening. Because of the storm, they only had two cars left to rent. I was in luck!
By midnight, I was already driving on the road to New York City, thoroughly exhausted from the unexpected events on my trip so far — but I had to keep going. I also had to drive as safely as possible, given the bad weather. In fact, my average speed was only about 40 miles an hour on the New Jersey highway (the posted speed limit was 65 miles an hour), since I had trouble seeing the road through the swirling snowfall.
I finally arrived at the JFK International Airport by 4:00 am in the morning. I had a few hours before I had to check in for my 9:00 am flight on the Concorde. But before I returned my rental car at the airport, I parked on a nearby street, set the alarm on my digital watch, and did my best to rest my eyes and maybe even sleep for a few hours.
At 7:30 am, I was already at the gate, where I then boarded my Concorde flight. Finally, the process was going smoothly. I must say: It was really nice experiencing that super-fast mode of transportation and flying so high in the sky (60,000 feet above sea level) that you could see the curvature of the Earth. As tired as I was, I kept looking out the little window by my seat as I marveled at this amazing technology that would hopefully allow me to fulfill my professional commitment to that inspired group of Spanish executives. Good news: The Concorde arrived in London pretty much on schedule at about 6:15 pm in the evening, local time.
Then I faced the next nightmare on my precarious journey to Barcelona.
When I entered the large room in the Heathrow Airport for going through customs, I was shocked to see a few hundred people who were waiting on a very, very long line to present their passport to a row of customs agents (and answer any questions about their trip and its purpose). My first response: “Oh my God. It’ll take me a few hours to get thought that line!” Since I had missed my previous connection from London to Barcelona (because my plane from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was damaged when it hit a van on the runway), I had to purchase a new plane ticket to Barcelona. I had already discovered that there was only one available flight this evening to that airport, leaving London at 7:45 pm and arriving in Barcelona at 11:00 pm, local time. If I missed that last flight to Barcelona, I wouldn’t get to deliver my presentation as scheduled. I would, once again, be in the exact same predicament as I had been in Philadelphia, just the evening before.
Basically, for me to make it to Barcelona so I could deliver my presentation to those executives on the very next morning, I first had to get through customs, next I had to make my way to the ticket counter in the airport lobby so I could purchase my ticket to Barcelona (and check in my suitcase), and then I had to sprint to the departing gate in time to make the flight, which was only 90 minutes from now. Keep in mind: There was no Internet in those days, so I couldn’t process anything online (such as scheduling my flight to Barcelona, let alone purchasing my airline ticket). I had to get to the right ticket counter, in person, which could only work if I got through customs in a hurry and then make it to the ticket counter in a very short period of time.
With my one suitcase in tow, I walked up to a uniformed customs agent who was positioned in the back of the room and asked him if there was some way that I could get to the front of the customs line, since I had to catch the last flight that evening to Barcelona. I told him that I had to make a keynote presentation the following morning, which was arranged for 50 executives more than six months ago. I exaggerated a little when I added that my professional reputation was at stake, so he would be sure to know that I really needed his help.
The customs agent listened intently and then said: “Everyone in this room has to be somewhere else by yesterday. I’m sorry for your situation, but you’ll have to wait on the same customs line, just like everyone else.” I also listened intently, but I wasn’t pleased with his response, so I asked again: “Isn’t there some way I can get through this line more quickly?” Again, the customs agent responded, “I’m sorry, Sir. But there is nothing I or anyone else can do. Everyone has to wait on the same line before going through customs. Several planes must have landed about the same time, which results in these long custom lines.”
It now seemed that this latest obstacle to my getting to Barcelona on time had thoroughly defeated me. Nevertheless, I thanked him for his consideration and began walking away to get on that very long line as soon as possible — even though the effort would be fruitless in the end. But a few seconds later, I instinctively turned around and walked back to that same customer agent and tried one more time to compel him to join me on my sacred mission: “I appreciate what you are saying, sir, but are you telling me that there is no way under the sun, no workaround, no loophole, no alternative … that would allow me to get to the front of the line?”
This time, the customs agent seemed to express a little more compassion on his face, as if another approach had miraculously, yet instantly, emerged from the deep recesses in his mind. He responded with a brand-new perspective on the current situation: “It seems you are going to keep pestering me for the rest of the evening unless I help you. How about this: If you promise to leave me alone and never bother me again, I’ll take you to the front of the customs line. Just follow me and all will be well.”
He proceeded to walk to the front of the customs line, with me right behind him. In a few moments, I was in the front of the line, showed my passport to the person who sat behind the counter and then answered his standard questions about why I was visiting London.
As soon as I had cleared customs, I thanked my dear friend who had stood right beside me for the entire time, and then I dashed to the designated counter in the airport lobby to purchase an airline ticket (and check in my suitcase) for that last evening flight to Barcelona.
When I was settled in my seat on the plane, I finally could take some deep breaths and reflect on the last 24 hours of my facing — and then surmounting — one roadblock after another on my very long journey to that distant mountain top. Yes, in the end, I made it to my intended destination on time and delivered my presentation to that inspired group of senior executives. Years later, I still marvel at all I had to go through, behind the scenes, to share my theories and methods with people and organizations around the globe.

So, you like to visit or would like to see Barcelona, but wish it were not so crowded and full of tourists like yourself? Travel writer Susan Kraus has a perfect alternative destination for you.
It was a beautiful autumn afternoon in Tarragona, Spain. Locals packed into the pedestrian-only cobbled streets of the medieval town center, and we were there with them, having found a perch on the side of a rock wall of the 12th- century Cathedral of Tarragona. All eyes were focused on the street, where a parade unlike anything I’d ever seen before was approaching. Costumed figures led the procession and were marching throughout the ranks. There were magical beasts spouting fire (seriously, fireworks and sparklers erupting from mouths and tails), dragons, sea serpents, massive bulls, a mermaid-dragon, and even a giant golden chicken. Diables ( five-foot high handcrafted heads of biblical, historical, and contemporary figures) bobbed past. Surrounding towns were represented by dancers and marchers, all in traditional regalia reflecting their local heritage. Musicians played bagpipes made from goat bellies and skins, drums of all sizes, flutes, and horns. Young girls in white lace dresses and red sashes performed the folk dances of their Catalan traditions. Participating towns were represented by monster mascots and their own strolling bands. It was a riotous mix of colors and sound.
This was the procession celebrating Santa Tecla, a beloved patron saint. Her festival, spanning 10 days each autumn, celebrates the return of a relic, her arm. The year 2022 marked 700 years since its return, but even without that milestone number, it’s clear from the celebrations that this is one very special arm — and that the traditions honoring it are alive and well.
As I stood among the crowd, I couldn’t help but contrast it to a parade in the United States. We would have barricades up and police ensuring no one ran into the street or got close to the fireworks spouting from the costumed creatures. But here there were no barricades, no warning signs. Sitting next to me was a mother, three kids in tow. I asked her if there were rules or guidelines I didn’t know about. She looked confused. “It is Santa Tecla, always the parade like this. So, don’t wear flammable clothing,” she replied, gesturing at two of her children who had run into the street and were hopping up and down around what looked like a dancing, metal-plated armadillo. “See, my kids have on old cotton. They just brush off the sparks.”
After the parade, we walked back to our hotel. In the square, a Catalan band was playing to hundreds of people who were swaying and dancing to the music. There were concerts every night all over the city. People don’t sleep much during Santa Tecla.
But it was the human towers, the next afternoon, the “castels” (castles), that blew me away. Dozens of cities and towns have teams, for the competition; people climb up each other’s backs, stand on each other’s shoulders, many stories high. They do not start to descend, sliding down backs, until a small child completes the tower by climbing to the top and raising a hand. This authentic, exhilarating celebration was our introduction to a city I had never known much about but is now one of my favorite European destinations.
Never Heard of Tarragona? (You’re Not Alone)Like Barcelona, its more famous cousin 52 miles to the north, Tarragona is an eastern Spanish port city on the Balearic Sea, leading to the Mediterranean. It is a modern city of just under 140,000, but with a medieval core of twisty pedestrian streets leading to the magnificent cathedral. Roman ruins seem ubiquitous, from the time when Tarragona was “Tarraco,” one of the earliest Roman settlements on the Iberian Peninsula, more important to the empire than Barcelona, and older than Madrid.
But Tarragona is not detailed in most popular guidebooks, from Fodor’s to Rick Steves. Those omissions are strange because Tarragona feels like how people described Barcelona some 50 years ago — when it was just as wonderful and full of historic and cultural attractions, but not drowning in tourists. Tarragona still has that feel of a rich cultural center, but with less hassle. No lines and no waits for tickets. No jostling in front of tourist photo spots.
Tarragona feels different. Relaxed. One example: Many Spanish cities have a rambla, a tree-lined promenade in the middle of the city where people stroll, congregate, and visit. In Barcelona, Las Ramblas is now congested, tourist-driven, dotted by souvenir kiosks every 20 feet, and full of jacked-up prices and pickpockets. But, in Tarragona, the Rambla Nova is for locals: parents pushing strollers, older couples arm-in-arm or sitting on park benches under the trees, and gaggles of teens checking each other out. There are street musicians, but they are not encircled by throngs of tourists. No kiosks. No pickpockets. This rambla is for the people who live here.
Unlike in Barcelona, in Tarragona it is easy to find wonderful and affordable accommodation. Our hotel, the B&B Centro Urbis, was on a corner overlooking the Placa de Corsini, which was lined with umbrella tables of bakeries and restaurants. Across the Placa was the Mercat Central, built in 1915 to house stalls of butchers, fisherman, and vendors of produce, fruit, baked goods, and flowers. Now, the Mercat Central is an upscale market for all of these goods, along with fabulous take-out food. Within the historic building, there are now escalators descending to a modern, spacious underground grocery store.
A More Relaxed DestinationThe sights and daily bustle of Tarragona became our entertainment. We would watch everyday life from the open window of our room. Each morning, parents walked their kids to school across the open square. Each afternoon, kids kicked soccer balls and rode bikes as parents bought groceries for supper at the Mercat. Street musicians provided a backdrop. After just a few days, we were immersed in a different lifestyle — people walked everywhere, were unhurried, relaxed.
Touring Tarragona was serendipitous. We tossed out the checklist and itinerary; we took hours for a meal. It felt good simply to sip wine and watch the parade of ordinary life, so different from our lives at home, passing by. Of course, there are things to see and do in Tarragona … but being there is pleasurable enough.
To See and Do
Roman Amphitheater — Dating from the 2nd century, when more than 13,000 people would flood this amphitheater to watch gladiators battle — and public executions.
National Archeological Museum of Tarragona — Covers 8 centuries, providing context to understand the city’s cultural evolution.
Circ Roma — Chariot races were held here as far back as the 1st century. Small museum of artifacts. Kids love the tunnels. Great views from the rooftop.
Cathedral of Tarragona — Built on the site of a Roman temple and Moorish mosque, with the Catholic cathedral dating from 1154. I loved the interior cloister. Small museum included.
El Serallo — The Waterfront district has a fishing village feel with pastel houses, waterfront promenade, and cafes with special fish dishes.
Museum of Modern Art — This is a jewel of a museum with changing exhibits. Its modern design is such a contrast to the cobbled streets of the old city that surround it.
Mercat Central Built in 1915 to centralize the stalls of butchers, fisherman, and other vendors, this is now an upscale shopping area.
Casa de la Festa — This small museum celebrates the festivals’ costumes, parade figures and history. Google “Casa de la Festa in Tarragona” to see delightful pictures of parade beasts and diables.
Port of Tarragona Museum — Maritime history, old ships, and artifacts galore are housed in this high-ceilinged, spacious waterfront warehouse.
Beaches — Playa de Milagro is walkable from the city center, along a bay with gentle waves. There are 15 kilometers of coastline, from rocky ledges to sandy coves. Many more beaches with amenities are with an hour’s drive.
Trails — There are 75 kilometers of paths to hike, mountain bike or ride horseback in and around Tarragona. Tourism offices have maps and suggestions.
Aqualon — A water park with slides, rafting, waterfalls and play equipment for youth and with deck chairs under palm trees for parents.
Jungle Trek is an adventure park with ziplines, rope bridges, and forest hikes.
For more Tarragona attractions, see tarragonaturisme.cat
Lodging TipsB&B Hotels (some do not do breakfast, but all have 24-hour coffee) originated in France but is a rapidly expanding European chain. Hotels are smaller, featuring minimalist décor and an IKEA feel. Prices shift with demand, but our shoulder-season rates were under $60 a night. If you’re planning to travel around Europe, consider a low-fee annual membership, with perks like 10% off every stay and more. Staying in Tarragona can be much less expensive than Barcelona, and trains and buses run regularly. Many Barcelona tours are available from Tarragona, with transportation provided.

In case you missed it, Barcelona have signed a lot of players.
Xavi Hernández has a whole new toy box — and while that’s exciting, finding the balance in his starting XI might be akin to solving a Rubik’s cube. Move any one piece, and you realise several others have to move with it.
This is particularly an issue in the back line. Traditionally, the most stable and unalterable part of the team. “You don’t mess with your centre back partnership”, I hear echoed through the eons of football clichés. And if Xavi is to go along with it, finding the right partnership early is of critical importance.
Today I’d like to play God (or rather, football manager) and work through the options Xavi has at his disposal.
We’ll discuss what is required from a CB in Xavi’s system, take a look at each profile, and knit together a winning combination.
This is a long read, so I’ve split it into chapters. Feel free to pick it up and come back to it.
Alright, let’s get started.
On the ball, Xavi’s centre backs have a varied level of responsibility depending on the game phase.
In general build up, when Barca have established possession, the centre backs are integral to ball progression. That’s because they have more time on the ball than anyone else.
Take the example below, against Real Madrid’s mid-block. The centre backs remain narrow, often supported by a full back (Alba), with the defensive midfielder ahead of them.
Madrid are doing what most organised teams will do: 1) man-mark the defensive midfielder and 2) block the passing lanes to the attacking midfielders.
This is a problem that needs solving. The centre backs need to be smart and technical enough to do so. They usually have three options:
The more of these options the CB can execute consistently, the more valuable they are on the ball. If they have a supreme passing range, and can also drive forward with the ball, they tick all the boxes.
Later we’ll look at the data to help us choose our ideal candidate.
Under pressure
The second scenario that Barca centre backs face is heavy opposition pressure. However, Xavi’s team has a tendency to be pragmatic in these situations, looking for a way out as early as possible.
This means the centre backs don’t have as much responsibility as you might expect.
Usually, they will either go backwards to goalkeeper Ter Stegen — who then is tasked with a progressive pass — or sideways to the full backs. The centre backs don’t tend to take risks.
At most, the centre back will be asked to play a diagonal pass, often to the full back. Which is why, if we’re ranking offensive attributes, passing range is the most important.
Calmness is also necessary, of course. Plus the ability to identify and execute these passes quickly.
Now, on to actual defending.
To be blunt, Xavi’s system is extremely demanding on its centre backs. Not only are we looking for an excellent technical profile, but defenders who can manoeuvre in high-risk situations. Xavi’s Barca commit players forward very aggressively, often leaving the centre backs with a lot of space to cover. Especially if the opponent goes direct.
In this example, eight players are caught ahead of the ball, and Ronald Araújo is burdened with a huge responsibility.
It’s not infrequent to see Barca centre backs isolated like this. Here, the decision whether to press aggressively, or slow the opponent down, is of utmost importance. Making the right call, and executing it decisively, is a huge part of the job.
So the next thing we’re looking for is a proficiency in 1 vs 1 duels. An imposing, athletic profile, capable of either winning the ball outright or (just as useful), slowing the opponent down until the midfielders get back.
Statistically, we can look at aerial duels won %, tackle %, fouls committed, and how often a player gets dribbled past to help find our man.
But wait, there’s more.
On top of this, we’re also looking for the best possible ‘traditional’ centre backs. Those that make important defensive actions inside the box, and nulify the opposition at critical moments.
These players are harder to find using raw data, because their decisions require context to understand. However, we will look at some clips to give us an idea at which defenders excel at this.
Ok, let’s summarise what we’re looking for in our ideal centre back. In a rough order of preference:
With all this in mind, it’s about time to look at our centre back choices, and try to find the right balance and partnership.
Age: 23
At 6'1"" and built like a heavyweight boxer, the Uruguyan behemoth is a unique and important profile in Barca’s squad.
He is clearly Barca’s most aggressive, physical and fastest defender. He wins the most aerial duels (73.5%), has the highest tackle success rate (76.7%) and gets dribbled past only 0.28 times per 90, less than anyone except Gerard Piqué.
In other words, he’s outstanding 1 vs 1, and a rugged ball winner who’s not afraid to engage far from his own box. He’s also a major threat from set pieces.
Sounds pretty good, right?
He has, however, shown some lapses of judgement when defending his own area. Often as a result of over-exuberance. Whether it’s abandoning his position, or getting too tight and committing a foul, he can — at times — lack the calmness that typifies the world’s best centre backs.
But Araújo’s bigger weakness is his on-the-ball prowess. While his pass completion number are good, he is often slow to identify the right option. He can be guilty of dwelling on the ball until the passing lane is blocked.
On top of that, he makes more mistakes on the ball and is dispossessed more often than any of the current Barca centre backs (Koundé has more errors, but we’ll talk about him later). This is highlighted most when Araújo is put under pressure.
He is, however, quite effective at carrying the ball forward. His speed and strength make him difficult to dispossess, and he’s brave enough to take responsibility.
All-in-all, we’re looking at a brute of a defender who, while not dreadful in possession, still needs to work on that aspect of his game.
Strengths: Barca’s premier ball winner, excellent 1v1, athletic and quick, not afraid to carry the ball forward
Weaknesses: Vision and passing range, uncomfortable under pressure
Age: 21
I thought it would be fun to put Eric next, because he’s at the other end of the defensive spectrum.
Without a doubt, Eric García is Barca’s best ball-playing centre back. He averages around 95% pass completion, and is by far the most accurate passer over long distances. He’s also the most proactive passer, identifying options and executing immediately. And to complete his passing profile, he’s deadly accurate with both feet.
He’s also very good at carrying the ball through the lines.
But, as I’m sure you know, this all comes at a cost. If Araújo is Barca’s best ball winner, Eric is by far the worst. He wins the least aerial duels (56.1%), is the least effective tackler (a pitiful 37% success rate), and gets beaten more than anyone else (0.75 times per 90).
It’s clear that Eric uses aggression to make up for his lack of physical stature— and it’s not totally in vain. Only Christensen makes more interceptions than Eric (2.29 per 90). But his aggression is a double edged sword; he commits more fouls than anyone else (1.59 per 90).
To give Eric his due, when he doesn’t have to win 1 vs 1 duels, he’s a reasonably stable defender. His anticipation inside the box is usually good, and he’s 100% committed, always. But at the highest level he can and has been bullied.
He’s young, so he has time to develop physically. And his skillset is so specialised that he’s worth keeping around. But you’d be hard-pressed to trust him when it’s do or die.
Strengths: Supreme passer with both feet, identifies passes quickly, carries the ball effectively, a solid box defender
Weaknesses: Loses duels often, commits a lot of fouls, a very inefficient ball winner
Age: 26
Christensen is a new addition to the squad who has already shown a lot of promise. He sits between Araújo and Eric on the real defender — ball-player spectrum, and I’d go so far as to call him the most balanced centre back in the squad.
Defensively his numbers are stellar. He made the most tackles + interceptions last season (3.13 per 90), while not getting beaten very often (0.30 times per 90), and also making very few fouls (0.78 per 90).
We can infer, then, that he’s a very efficient ball winner. Even his tackle success rate (66.7%) is only eclipsed by Araújo.
He’s less aggressive than the Uruguayan, but an equally effective defender in most scenarios. He wins less aerial duels (only 61.9%), but he’s better suited to defending his own box due to his calmness and positional awareness.
Christensen’s other advantage is a rounded profile in possession. He too is capable of carrying the ball forward. But more importantly, he has excellent vision and passing range. After Eric, he’s the most consistent passer over long distances.
A balanced profile that is certainly in contention for a starting position.
Strengths: A composed ball winner, commits few fouls, good vision and passing range, a great box defender
Weaknesses: Aerial duels, not as fast or athletic than some of his competition
Age: 23
Koundé is a very interesting case, and not just because of the fanfare around his signing.
Of all the centre backs in the squad, Koundé is by far the most forward thinking. He is a willing ball carrier, who is often seen marauding into the opponent’s final third.
This offensive movement has been facilitated by Sevilla’s system. The holding midfielder (usually Fernando) drops between the centre backs in possession, creating a pseudo back three. With Koundé on the right, he has license to break forward and become an offensive threat. And he’s not shy about it.
Positionally, this role is quite comparable to how Barca’s inverted full backs operate. It suits Koundé because it makes the most of his ability to break lines, while also remaining an important defensive presence — particularly in transition.
So lets move onto his defensive ability. He is, undoubtedly, an accomplished defender despite his young age. His combination of anticipation, balance, speed and composure is frightening. Not only is he extremely difficult to beat, he reads the game immaculately, making him a superb defender around his own box.
His anticipation borders on prescience; it’s like he’s moving before the ball is played.
In terms of underlying data, he’s most comparable to Christensen. He is dribbled past only 0.33 times per 90 and commits fewer fouls than anyone else (0.72 per 90). His tackle success rate (63%) is middle of the road, as are his aerial duels (64.5% won), but he has an advantage when it comes to speed and athleticism.
You can see why there’s so much excitement around this signing.
Strengths: Excellent 1 vs 1, fast and athletic, great anticipation and composure inside his own box, attacking mentality and high-impact ball carrier
Weaknesses: Lowest pass completion over long distances (73.8%)
Age: 35
Ah, Piqué. A club legend who, even up until last season, was Barcelona’s most important defender. At least, that’s what the data suggests.
When Piqué was on the pitch, Barcelona’s xG difference increased by +0.77 per game, compared to when he wasn’t playing. That’s the biggest impact of any defender last season.
Of course, stats like these need context. Piqué profited from being fit during Barca’s most successful spell of the season. Truth be told, his level has dropped, injuries have blighted him, and physically he sometimes struggles to keep up.
That’s why last season he went to ground more often, and committed more fouls than ever before (1.47 per 90).
However, his defensive numbers are still very adequate. Last season he was second only to Araújo in aerial duels (67.4% won). He was dribbled past less often than anyone (0.22 per 90). He also made the most recoveries (11.8 per 90).
However (spoiler alert) he’s not in my first choice back line.
On the evidence of pre-season, his physical condition is deteriorating considerably. If he can’t be counted on for the vast majority of the campaign, it makes little sense to give him minutes over the other options.
His experience will be useful, as will his leadership. But there’s enough quality in the squad now to warrant phasing him out of the team. And at 35, there’s no shame in that.
Ok, we’ve finally made it. I think this calls for a drum role…
If I were Xavi, my first choice back four would be:
I know, this might come as a surprise. In fact, I’m going against 80% of fans who voted on my Twitter poll. But let me explain.
Christensen — Araújo — Koundé is unbreakable
This is, admittedly, a defence-first selection. By sacrificing a ‘real’ right back I’m taking away an important offensive weapon, right?
Well, not exactly.
As I explained earlier, Barca commit a lot of players forward. At the very least, it’s the front three, plus both attacking midfielders. Sometimes Jordi Alba joins in too. Purely for the sake of balance, I want the remaining players to be defensively imperious. These three — Koundé, Araújo and Christensen — are exactly that.
This decision is made easier by the fact that Xavi’s right back is often inverted. Working in the right half-space, it’s important for the right back to be comfortable on the ball, carry a threat from a deep position, and manage transitions effectively.
Here’s why I think Koundé fits the bill perfectly:
Why Koundé at right back?
Knowing that I want these three in the starting lineup, the question is who’s being ‘sacrificed’ at right back. I’ve gone with Jules Koundé.
The obvious answer is Araújo, but on the evidence I’ve seen, he’s simply not comfortable enough receiving on the touchline or under pressure. Meanwhile, as we’ve seen, Koundé’s role at Sevilla is surprisingly similar to an inverted right back.
For example, he can comfortably receive and progress from the right touchline:
He can drive forward and break lines in the right half-space, which is an incredibly valuable weapon against well-organsied mid blocks:
He can find runners from the right half-space:
He can comfortably snuff out counter-attacks:
And he can defend 1 vs 1 against the world’s best wingers:
It’s unfortunate that, at right back, you might lose his fantastic positional awareness in the box. But for my money it’s a risk worth taking to get both Araújo and Christensen in the starting XI.
Why Christensen at left centre back?
I think Christensen is a fantastic defender. He was a staple in Chelsea’s Champions League winning team, and he’s shown already he can adapt to Barca’s system.
He’s at left centre back specifically for two reasons. 1) I want Araújo on his more comfortable side, because he’s less composed under pressure. 2) Christensen is better equipped to deliver the left-to-right diagonal ball into the right winger.
Barca create a lot of overloads on the left, with the intention of switching the ball over to the right, where Dembélé (or Raphinha) is 1 vs 1. Christensen will execute this more consistently than Araújo.
What about Eric?
I wouldn’t be surprised if Eric García gets decent game time this season. Against teams that provide little attacking threat, perhaps. Equally, I can see him wasting away on the bench.
His performances in pre-season have been excellent. His profile is unique and Barca are certainly more devastating offensively when he’s playing. But at the highest level, the reward isn’t worth the risk.
He has time, though. He’s only 21.
And finally…Piqué?
You might have noticed that Piqué is the only centre back over the age of 26. That’s not ideal. His level might have dropped, but from a squad-dynamics perspective, he’s a useful asset.
I think Piqué will get some game time this year, perhaps to protect a player on a yellow card, or in a rotational situation. But in terms of development, it’s far more important to prioritise every other player on this list.
So there we have it. No doubt plenty of you will have something to say about my selections and reasoning, so I’m continuing the discussion over on Twitter. I hope to see you there.
FINALLY — this is one of the more extensive pieces I’ve put together. If you enjoyed, please do ‘clap’, it helps immensely. And, as always, follow the page for more in-depth Barcelona content.
Until next time!

7 Reasons why FC Barcelona has fallen so low
FC Barcelona frustrated me for a long period of time. They have beaten teams I supported far too often. Now, the situation is quite the opposite, which brought many smiles to my face. However, I didn’t wish them to fall so far of a cliff.
The Catalans were knocked out of a Champions League. In Spanish Primera Divison they are nowhere near the title race. Things that were seasons or months ago self-evident are nowadays anything but that. Let us look at 7 reasons why this is the case.
Everything starts and ends with money. Unfortunately. Due to COVID-19, the club’s income rapidly fell. Because of that players at some point lowered their wages up to 70%. A case where Gerard Piqué had to lower his earnings to the point that newcomers could join the club before the season (Sergio Agüero, Memphis Depay …) was bizarre. With the ability to earn more in clubs that are perhaps nowhere near the rename of Barcelona, footballing superstars are far from being the biggest fans of joining the Spanish giant. Earning more in an environment with less pressure is far more tempting right?
2. Inability to keep Lionel Messi
Related to point 1. was an inability to keep Lionel Messi. The greatest footballer that ever was, didn’t receive permission from the Spanish La Liga delegates that he could play for free (Barca no longer afforded him due to enormous debt). Therefore, he moved to PSG and the club was left without a player that won them trophies and football matches over and over again. Sometimes even simultaneously. It’s true that lately, he stuck his nose in something that he should not have (more on that later), but since decision-makers decided to tolerate it, his departure was a massive blow.
3. Catastrophic recruitment
Since Neymar left, everything went from bad to worse in a transfer market for “Mes que un Club”. The pressure to add a deadly quality to the duo Suarez-Messi (later only Messi) was enormous. And it failed on every single occasion. Barca has spent hundreds of millions of pounds for the likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Philippe Coutinho, and Antoine Griezmann. If anyone justified their gigantic transfer fees then we should all stop watching this beautiful sport right away. It’s as simple as that. Dembélé was struggling with injuries most of the time, Griezmann was with his head still in Atletico Madrid and Barca’s fan opinions stressed in public made Coutinho forget how to properly play football.
4. Inability to stabilize the team’s core
It would be totally unfair if we have criticized only the above-mentioned players. Arda Turan, Samuel Umtiti, Miralem Pjanić, Martin Braithwaite, Andre Gomes, etc. were all high-profile players. Players that would stabilize the team and bring what is required of them. Instead, these mid-size signings if you like, also failed in the long term. The team was extremely far away from the season 2008/2009 when you can name practically the same starting 11 at 3 AM all year long.
5. Lionel Messi
We covered that, right? Nope. We are just getting started. Despite all the unique masterclass, the Argentinian overstepped his authorization far too many times. By giving ultimates to the club president who should they buy and sack, which became publicly known, he tried to position himself as the biggest authority there is. Even bigger than a club itself. Something like a one-man band. Remember, no player is greater than the club. Just ask David Backham’s rubbed face when it was hit by the football booth thrown by Sir Alex Ferguson when the England international tried to do the same. In this case, Josep Maria Bartomeu didn’t have a plan for how to deal with “bossing” Messi. It seemed that he opted for a middle ground by fulfilling and on the other hand rejecting some of his wishes. However you put it, the full extent of such bad influence is seen now. The recruitment process should be dealt with by the people responsible for that. Furthermore, Messi’s lack of defensive engagement only worsened the whole situation on the pitch. Walking on the field after they were losing became a begging to an end of once a brilliant all eleven team effort. And when everyone is not committed 100%, poor results follow, especially on important matches.
6. Shaken European mindset.
After squandering a big advantage against A. S. Roma, uncertainty began to flood through the veins of Barcelona’s players when it came to Champions League matches. After repeating the same against Liverpool a year later, a winning mentality changed immediately. Catastrophes against Bayern Munich and PSG seasons later were written all over. Hmmm. Let me correct myself. Everything even escalated by not reaching the competition’s knock-out phase this year.
7. Sacking Ernesto Valverde
Being first on a La Liga table doesn’t guarantee you keeping a managerial position. Total madness. Before that, Valverde also brought 4 trophies to the club. After sitting top of the table, he was sacked because of … whatever strange reasons you believe. Since his departure “Mes que un Club’s” strength only worsened.
There you have it. If you think, I have missed any, just let me know in the comments below. I’d be happy to agree or disagree.

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

Alright, Barça fans — with love, truly — but who told you to walk into San Siro like you were on a guided tour of the Colosseum? Yes, the Camp Nou is majestic, yes, the Barça DNA, positional play, and all that jazz. But the Champions League isn’t a stroll down Las Ramblas — it’s the Iliad: every match is an epic, and the gods — fickle as ever — love flipping the script right before the final note. And in this opera, the twist came from a character nobody saw coming.
Because watching Barça up 3–2 in the 89th minute, at San Siro, no less, felt like watching Achilles casually sipping tea. “It’s done,” you thought. Victory in hand, job well done. The Inter players looked half-dead, folded back like they knew how this was going to end. But there’s always a Hector ready to charge in — except this Hector was 37 years old, had beaten cancer twice, wrestled with alcohol and depression, and answered to the name Francesco Acerbi.
And this is where it gets good — and beautiful. Tancredi Palmieri told the story on The Iñaki Angulo Show with that mix of awe and disbelief: Inter, on the ropes, legs gone, out of breath — and suddenly… Acerbi! What the hell was he doing up there? Nobody knows. Inzaghi didn’t send him. There was no arrow on the tactics board saying “90th minute, Acerbi turns into last Roman standing.” Even his own teammates had no clue. Darmian summed it up in the mixed zone like a man still dazed: “Nobody told him to go up.”
And there he was. In the 90th minute, body probably screaming, Acerbi showed up in the box like a centurion who missed the retreat call, crashing through the chaos like an old wolf smelling blood in the fog. A loose ball, a single opening — and bang. With his foot, not his head. No flourish, no elegance — just pure grit. He struck it like a man who’d had enough. Goal. Barça stunned. San Siro exploding. Wojciech Szczęsny frozen like a marble statue watching history unfold.
Because Acerbi’s move wasn’t tactical. It was faith. Rebellion. A refusal to accept the script. That goal wasn’t a play — it was a soul cry. A man who’s stared death in the eye — the real kind, and the kind that creeps in silently — knew that some moments don’t wait for permission.
De Rossi nailed it: “Acerbi thought, this can’t happen to me.” And that right there? That’s not football anymore. That’s pure Nietzsche — the will to power. That raw, vital force that doesn’t just want to win, it wants to affirm life, to scream yes in the face of pain and limits and fading odds.
At 37, scarred more than stat-padded, Acerbi ignored the clock, the fatigue, the script — and rewrote the ending. A guy who’d never scored in the Champions League picked that moment to make his mark. As if to say, “I choose when this ends.”
In that improbable leap, in that lone-wolf instinct, the brutal beauty of sports came alive: the best don’t always win, but sometimes the most human do the impossible. And right there, in the chaos and the glory, a story was born. One Barça probably still doesn’t fully understand. But the rest of the football world does.

My study abroad experience has undoubtedly been the most memorable quarter of my time at UW and one of the most transformative experiences in my life so far.
Through my classes, I’ve had the chance to observe the distinct teaching approaches in Spanish education. The country’s remarkable transportation system has allowed me to travel weekly, visiting destinations beyond Barcelona such as Madrid, Tarragona, and Granada. I even had the eye-opening opportunity to spend five days in Morocco with a school group, where I was immersed in a culture vastly different from my own.
The highlight of this journey has been my homestay with a local Spanish family, where I’ve been fully immersed in both the language and culture. Their incredible warmth has made me feel at home, and I feel my Spanish has improved significantly.
This experience has solidified my long-standing interest in a global career, strengthening my desire to pursue a path filled with international opportunities that will continue to fuel my curiosity and passion for cultural exploration.

Eating our way through Disfrutar, Bar Canete, Mont Bar, and more
I made our reservation at Disfrutar a year in advance. Literally 365 days. Right before San Pellegrino ranked it the 2024 best restaurant in the world. We planned a whole trip to Europe around this lunch. However, making that reservation was actually the easy part. The hard part was deciding where to eat our other meals. The options were overwhelming, but I ultimately made some hard choices, and I’m mostly happy with my picks.
I’ll cut to the chase — this restaurant was worth the trip!
PROS: The food was exactly as I’d hoped it would be. It was creative, delicious, and fun. It was surprising, but not too weird or serious. One of my favorite things about high-end Spanish dining is how joyful and playful chefs are with their food. We laughed and tried on chocolate rings and exploded walnut shells all over the table and cleaned our hands with water drops shaken out of a red rose. We ate caviar on top of a butter cloud and inside of a doughy bun, spherical-I olives, and golden eggs. We left stuffed, but not painfully so. It’s not the best meal I’ve ever had, but it’s fully deserving of being in the same category as San Pellegrino’s other best restaurants in the world. It’s a much more casual experience vs. something like Noma (which feels like a special event every step of the way), and it’s closer to the El Bulli style with innovative food in an unexpected setting. While I leave most fancy meals thinking one time was enough, this is a meal that I’d actually want to eat again soon. I’m including more photos at the bottom of this post.
CONS: Just two gripes…
(1) When we first arrived, I was horrified that they sat us at one of the two worst tables in the restaurant located in the entry hallway instead of in the dining room. Those two tables should not be used for regular bookings. I feel bad for the staff who have to disappoint two groups at every seating by showing them to these tables. I was worried the lack of atmosphere was going to ruin the whole meal, but luckily, it ended up allowing us to focus more on the food.
(2) The sommelier did not know their wine list and was unable to give a recommendation for a Spanish wine Chablis drinkers might enjoy. Later in the meal, he suggested a second bottle that did not pair well with the richer, hearty final courses. I’d expect more at a restaurant of this caliber. However, the rest of the team provided excellent service.
While the trip was planned around Disfrutar, we certainly didn’t go hungry for our other meals…
Mont Bar — World-class fine dining in a bar
I’m so sad that this restaurant isn’t in San Francisco, because I would eat here regularly if I could. Since reservations for Disfrutar are so impossible, this is the restaurant that I will recommend to everyone I know. They manage to strike a unique balance between a fancy special occasion restaurant and an informal tapas spot (they self describe as “fine dining in a bar”). The restaurant is tiny with space for about 20 people. Most diners are eating the tasting menu or creating their own tasting menu like we did. When I read the menu online, I was worried that the combinations of ingredients were going to be too unusual, but everything came together beautifully. We all agreed the chicken skin squid canape was our favorite bite of the night, but we also loved the sea bass ceviche, mochi with sobrasada, and tuna belly. The nori seaweed and caviar ice cream sandwich was a wonderfully weird way to end the night.
Berbena — Hip newcomer, still finding its footing
The vibe of this restaurant was perfect. It was upscale but casual, with an open kitchen and a small dining area that was full, but not too cramped. The waiters had a warm style, and it felt like they were all friends and you got to be their friend for the night too. They did a great job offering us a range of wine options based on our preferences. The food menu was interesting and diverse, but only had a few standout dishes. You must order the bread with sides (sliced ham and butter), the tapioca & cheddar dadinho (delightful texture and cheesy taste) and all the desserts. Somehow I did not take pictures of any of the best dishes! The vegetables and main courses were all underwhelming, but I would go back again in a different season since the menu changes regularly.
Bar Canete — Old school tapas, worth the hype
I was worried this famous spot would be full of tourists, and it was — but I still loved it (supposedly the locals arrive around 10pm). You’ll have to force your way to the front of a crowd to check in with the host, but as long as you have a reservation they operate efficiently. We were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation. The waiter was high energy and funny and helped steer us towards all the best dishes. We ordered way too much, but I’m glad we didn’t miss the tuna tartar, steak with foie gras, or crema catalana.

Barcelona — Zaragoza — San Sebastian — Cudillero — A Coruña — Madrid — Valencia.
This November I turned 30 years old and decided to celebrate it with my friend Eugene, traveling across Spain. Though I grew up in the far east of Russia, it was a long awaited return to a place where, five years ago, I lived and studied. Spain is also a place that I once called my “foreign homeland.”
After landing in Barcelona, we rented a car, named it “Pepe,” and embarked on our Spanish journey. Throughout the trip we visited seven cities in seven different Spanish regions, going from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coast and back to the southeast of Spain.
Here are some personal impressions of the places we visited.
We arrived in Spain during the pinnacle of a political conflict: “Catalonia v. Spain“ — a perennial debate that has engulfed the region, culminating in Catalonia’s recent independence vote. The day we landed there was a demonstration in favor of a unified Spain in la Plaza de Ayuntamiento de Barcelona. Semi-sober protesters, draped in Spanish flags, were yelling, singing, drinking and dancing in favor of not dividing the country into two.
The following day we went to listen to Estrella Morente’s heart-touching voice. The widely renowned star of Spain’s traditional flamenco music headlined a concert at the iconic Palau de la Musica in Barcelona with her band. While purchasing the tickets I asked the woman at the box office if she liked Señorita Morente. The attendant charmingly looked at me and said, “Of course. She’s the most important singer…from a country that is next to us.”
In Zaragoza, in the Aragon region in between Barcelona on the south coast and San Sebastián, near the French border on the north coast, I met up with my friend Nick, a photographer who recently moved with his family from New York City to a small village near Lleida in Catalonia.
Nick said that after living in New York he feels way more relaxed in Spain. He’s discovered a new lifestyle. Life on the outskirts has its own advantages, including fresh food and a chill vibe, but also its flaws, namely a lack of art that is vital for the nourishment of any artist. Nick loves the region and terribly misses his work, photographing people and making portraits. Gladly, he brought his camera to our luncheon and we did a few shots in the streets of Zaragoza. Ever since meeting Nick in New York a year ago, I’ve considered him my photo inspiration. Every time I face his camera we get lost in the collaborative process and find creative images together.
Barcelona is my favorite city and the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. Or so I thought until I re-discovered San Sebastian, a resort town that is located near the French border on the north coast. Six years ago I visited but I don’t know how I failed to fully appreciate all of its beauty. Walking the streets of the old city and experiencing the sunset from atop a mountain was perhaps was one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve had — ever.
While wandering around San Sebastián, I happened upon a local bakery in town where I randomly met an 18 year old young kid from Guatemala. We sat for coffee and talked. Our surface conversation led us a to a deeper level, sharing personal stories. He told me that his parents found out that he is gay and did not take it so well. He turned sad when talking about his family and said that he didn’t want to have contact with them anymore. He left his home and rented a small room in this city. Now he goes to college in the morning and works at the bakery in the evening. He dreams of being a model and a flight attendant. I was amazed by his strength and focus at such a young age. I was touched by his coming out story. He reminded me of myself and my own.
In Cudillero, a small village in the northwest of Spain, we rode horses for a stroll through the rugged forest to observe the sea from the top of the mountains. It was one of the most therapeutic experiences I’ve had. The beauty and harmony of green Asturian nature mixed with the rhythm and sound of the horse’s hoofs created a sense of pure bliss.
Right before we began the afternoon journey, a small dog approached me. Her fur was matted and messy from the rain, and, she had sad gaze. I caressed the dog and said, “hello.” She was friendly and even with a coat that could use a brushing, quite cute. Five minutes later, as we mounted our horses and made our way to the main road to start the trail into the woods, our guide, Jesus, noticed that the dog was laying on the grass along the narrow road. The dog was dead.
Although we didn’t see what happened, probably a passing car hit the dog. She belonged to Jesus’s co-worker and Jesus started to weep deeply. Tears of sorrow also struck my own heart. It made me think of life and instant death. Five minutes ago I was caressing a dog and looking into her eyes and then …bah… and the soul is gone.
A few days later we went to see Goya’s “Black Paintings” in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Among all of them there was one that grabbed my full attention. Perhaps I would not have been so struck by it if it had not been for the recent accident. The painting, called “Drowning Dog,” represented fatality and mortality. I still keep thinking about it — the painting, the dog and the message.
In A Couña, a port city in the Galician region, I had the most delicious Pulpo a la Gallega. In general, food all over Spain is fantastic. I could eat cheese with bread and drink wine endlessly, as long as its Spanish. The cuisine embraces the pure art of a simple food. No need to go to a fancy restaurant approved by magazines, or entitled with the stars. Just stop by a local bar and ask for un pincho de tortilla con un cortado. Simple and easy … and damn good!
My new acquaintance Davide commented that if you are born in Galicia you have to say that you are Gallego, not Spaniard. In some areas of Galicia if you, as a Gallego, proclaim yourself a Spaniard first, “you might be beaten up,” he said. Two other friends from Galicia were in total disagreement with Davide’s statement when I shared it with them.
Traveling through Spain we faced, on several occasions, statements from people proclaiming their regional pride. Throughout Cataluña we heard how proud people are to be Catalan first, and later in Cudillero, locals expressed pride at being born in Asturias region, then in A Coruña, in Spain’s far corner above Portugal, girlfriends of mine did not let us buy them lunch proclaiming, Vamos a pagar nosotros porque somos chicas Gallegas (We will pay for ourselves, because we are Galician girls)!
Later in Valencia, south of Madrid and back on the Mediterranean coast, people speak Valenciano and feel deeply rooted in their language and its preservation. It was interesting to observe how one single country is so diversely separated by it own dialect, food, language, culture and economics. People throughout the nation persistently point out these differences. It felt foreign as coming from Russia, it never occurred to me, nor any of my friends, to proudly declare that we are from a specific region.
I turned 30 between day and and night somewhere on the road between Madrid and Valencia. I was driving a car, accompanied by an exceptionally beautiful sunset that scattered around the sky and minute by minute as if it were a perfectly composed playlist, changing colors as if they were tracks of music, from mild light blue to loud poisoning red to eventually calm and quiet dim orange. It felt deeply symbolic, driving forward towards new experience without looking back.
Heraclitus once said, ”No man ever steps into the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.“ The more I age the more I get it.
In 2010 I came to Valencia from my home country of Russia to get my Masters degree. I studied Communication at the University of Valencia and graduated in 2012. When I got a job offer in New York City, I left Spain. Needless to say, I felt quite emotional coming back after five years of separation.
The morning after we arrived, I was showing my friend Eugene my favorite places where I spent the best times of my youth. I took him through the river from the City of Arts and Science to the Old City and the City Center. On bikes, we rode to my language school where I studied Spanish, and I wandered through the halls of my university and somehow found myself in the cafeteria. I recall that I was always hungry during that time and looked at the faculty terrace and saw students smoking in groups and chatting about university life sitting on the stairs. I did exactly the same a half decade ago.
It felt surreal.
We greeted the sunset atop Torres de Serrano, where the old town starts. If you climb the stairs of the tower you can observe a spectacular view of the city. At the top there was one young guy playing guitar and one girl clapping in the rhythm of flamenco. The sound of the music, the towers, and the sunset all together were so harmonic that I could not help but dance.
My trip ended in Valencia. Eugene left for the U.S. and I stayed in the city for a few more days meeting new people, discovering and rediscovering old friends and simply walking around Valencia, absorbing the Spanish air, voices, smells and sights. It made me realize that I fell in love with Spain — again. Or perhaps my Spanish romance never stopped, it just took a five year break.
I hope our long distance relationship will continue to develop in some way no matter how far we are from each other.
Traveling by car across the country is the best way to discover Spain. Our car “Pepe” took us from the south all the way through the north and back to the south, more than 2,100 km. Spanish highways are high-end!
Barcelona — Sail the Mediterranean with Enric and see the city from the sea boathttps://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Barcelona-Fun-Sailing/members/204961128/
Zaragoza — It’s impossible to avoid passing it but Basilica del Pilar is an astonishing architectural legacy.
San-Sebastian — Among of the best Pinxos I tried were here at Atari Gastroteka. Calle Mayor 18
Cudillero — Climb to the mirador and take a look at the village from above. It worth it to travel all the way there just to see the view with your own eyes.
A Coruña — Have lunch at Pulperia de Melide ask for Pulpo a la gallega — OMG — this Octopus with potatoes was EVERYTHING. You can not imagine.
Madrid — Dine at Sobrino de Botin — one of the oldest restaurants in the city founded in 1725. Calle Cuchilleros 17
Valencia — Cozy atmosphere, tasty coffee and way too tasty pastries are at coffee shop Dulce de Leche. You can sit there forever and it’s not going to be enough. A place I always want to come back. Carrer de Pintor Gispert 2

Before we went to Barcelona, we thought that Boulder, Colorado, north of Denver, might be the world’s dog-loving capital. In Boulder, you can take your dog practically everywhere, and people do. They’re in restaurants and grocery stores, running alongside their bike-riding owners, playing in dog parks, and going on walks. According to one website, there are 15,000 dogs in Boulder, and one out of three households has a dog.
Then, after our 10 days there, I had to believe that Barcelona residents had to love dogs more. There were dogs everywhere we went.
Imagine my surprise when I looked on Google to discover that neither Boulder nor Barcelona is the biggest dog-loving city. There are lots of cities with more dogs per capita, including Houston, Seattle, Bern, Budapest, and others, including Paris and Denver. But I have to wonder if this website is truly up-to-date.
Barcelona may not be the biggest dog-loving city listed on Google, still perhaps it’s the city that cleans up after its dogs the best.
Only once in 10 days did we encounter squished dog poop on the sidewalk, unlike in Paris, where you have to watch where you step, even in the nicer neighborhoods…

On Monday, April 28, a power outage disrupted travel and daily life across Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and parts of France and Belgium — grounding planes, halting trains, and leaving hundreds stuck in elevators. This is a first-hand account of what it was like to be in the middle of the outage.
“Everything all right? You seem tense,” my wife remarked from the passenger seat. We were in the car, a roaring Peugeot 3008 with brake calipers screaming to be replaced, driving our six-month-old to his pediatrician appointment across town.
I’m a calm driver — somewhere between your grandpa and a limo chauffeur — except for the occasional curse word. At least normally. Yet yesterday, the streets of Barcelona were unusually jammed even for a Monday. I could feel myself getting more tense by the minute. And, apparently, so could my wife.
“Half the traffic lights aren’t working,” I pointed out. “Oh, sh — “ I slammed on the brakes. “That guy on the left thinks he has the right of way.”
“Must be some kind of power outage.”

What does it look like when the idea of care as a practice that sustains life, communities, and cities is considered in an urban context? How can this idea be used to inform projects and planning interventions? Those were some of the questions we brought with us to Barcelona (Spain) where we have been conducting fieldwork this week. Today, we completed our visit as part our ongoing research into care-informed urban planning. The project titled “Care-Informed Urban Planning: Learnings and Exchange Across Countries and Sectors” aims is to generate insights into how care ethics are operationalised in the context of planning and urban governance in selected cases. The insights, exchanges, and warm welcomes we encountered in Barcelona have left us both intellectually energised.
Barcelona is truly intriguing. It is a city that is not shying away from pioneering projects, programs, and interventions informed by ideas around inclusion, Ethics of Care, and feminism. We learned that the Barcelona City Council has set up the Area for Feminisms and Equality, a department with a commitment to gender equality, has established the Councillor’s Office for Feminism and LGBTI Affairs and set up a Gender Impact Assessment (GIAs) tool used in policymaking processes, particularly in urban planning and budgeting. These initiatives are part of Barcelona’s broader Gender Justice Plan, aiming to work on inequality through proximity and diversity and reflect a broader commitment to feminist municipalism, integrating equality into urban governance and public policy.
During our fieldwork, we aimed to understand and gain a clearer perspective on how considerations about care are integrated into urban governance. We are incredibly grateful for the warm welcome and generous engagement we received from everyone who we spoke with.
Barcelona has a rich and dynamic approach to urban governance, where multiple actors are involved in shaping living environments. Care concerns seem to be informing many activities of urban governance. We had the chance to learn more about a range of innovative interventions that make care visible and actionable within the urban fabric.
These include the time use initiative, climate refuges, the justice-based approach to culture, Vila Veïna, and the city’s superblocks (in Esp. superilles). Most of these initiatives are run at the neighbourhood level, and a common thread across these efforts is the idea that care is not just a private matter confined to the home. Instead, care is increasingly recognised as a collective, social, and spatial issue. It is an issue that belongs in the public domain. And as such, it deserves institutional recognition, public investment, professional expertise, and spaces for diverse voices to be heard, especially those historically underrepresented in traditional planning processes.
We’re leaving Barcelona inspired and full of ideas and reflections. Thank you to all those who shared their time, knowledge, and reflections with us.
With gratitude,Romina & Miriam

“Gun store, liquor store, gun store… Where the fuck you taking me!?!” -Dave Chappelle (Killing Em’ Softly)
April 12, 2006
My 3 cabinmates were far lamer than the ones from my other long train trip, so I drank in the bar car by myself and bit my nails until I was drunk enough to pass out. My dad bit his nails too, and I’ve always been extremely embarrassed of the habit as a result. It’s just so hard to quit a drug you grow yourself.
When I woke up, we were in the French countryside, which had no graffiti, but was still quite beautiful, with its’ rolling hills, herds of sheep, and never-ending rows of grapes to be transformed to wine.
That reminds me of a Mitch Hedberg joke…
“I saw this wino, he was eating grapes. I was like dude you have to wait.”
I could feel the temperature, and the moods of the passengers change as soon as we crossed the border into Spain and saw the sea. Only the sea, or maybe a bucket of Xanax, can calm an anxious crowd of travelers so quickly. Anticipation turned to relaxation, as we watched the waves crash into the shore. Redemption was in the air, and I was more than ready for mine.
Stepping off the train, I felt like Uma Thurman in Pulp fiction when she takes the shot of adrenaline to her heart. I was born anew, my past mistakes forgiven. The Berghain, the prostitute, the near arrests… Those mishaps were soon to be a thing of the past. Barcelona, I told myself, would be my travel baptism.
My hostel was only a short walk from the train, and when I got there, I was impressed. It was very much righton the beach. The sand reached the entrance. There were a few guys drinking outside with their shirts off. One of them had a brindle hound he let me pet. Everything was falling right into place.
I was greeted warmly by the manager, who, to my surprise, bought me a beer while I waited for the room to be cleaned — a fine protocol, if you ask me. As soon as my room was ready, I threw on my shorts, along with the flip flops I’d been using to shower, and headed for the beach with my book in tow. On the way, I stopped in a little shop, which looked very much like a New York bodega, and bought a few 20oz Heineken cans. I had my book, my cigs, and my drinks. I was set until dinner.
There were only about 100 people peppered along the beach, most of them drinking in small cliques. I found an isolated area and made myself comfortable. I was almost done with my book and had every intention of finishing it that day.
As soon as I fixed my eyes on the page though, I heard a voice, an American sounding one, holler in my direction.
Guy: What book are you reading?
I looked up and saw three men walking towards me. The one leading the way was pale and gruff looking, maybe 35 years old, with a mullet. He was wearing jeans and a jean jacket.
Me: Hunter Thompson. Ever heard of him?
Guy: No. It sure is big though.
Me: Yep, lots of words.
Guy: Are you making fun of me?
Me: No, not at all. I’m Sam. Here, have a beer. I have one more if you fellas don’t mind sharing.
Guy: Sure, we can share. My name is John. That’s Carlos, and that’s Aaron.
I pulled the remaining two beers out of my bag and tossed them their way.
This was my thinking… Here we had three odd strangers who had been nothing but nice thus far, though I was sensing some odd undercurrents. So, I made a generous offer of friendship, one that would allow me to gather additional information from a position of kindness and generosity, as opposed to weary skepticism. That approach has gotten me far in life. The other benefit was that I was now out of my remaining beers and had an excuse to leave our soiree as soon as my can ran dry. Not bad, right?
Aaron was about 30 years old and didn’t talk so I couldn’t determine where he was from. His skin was weathered from the sun, his blue tank top tattered from years of wear. He wreaked of beer like he’d been drinking for two straight days. And he seemed a bit touched, but that could have been the result of a sun-soaked bender. It was hard to tell.
Carlos looked to be about 20 years old. He was quiet, with dark skin and a 90’s bowl cut. I could tell he was much more innocent than the other two. I assumed he was a local but couldn’t be sure. [SR1]
Both guys gestured towards me but none of us shook hands. We were a crew now, whether I liked it or not. At least until my beer ran out.
John: We need more beer.
He flipped his can over to show me he’d finished it.
I thought, “FUUUUCK, that was remarkably fast,” realizing the trap I’d fallen into. It was now becoming clear that they were homeless people, and John was the leader of the crew. He had me in his sights. I was the mark, and he was going to work me for as much as he could. I scrambled for an out but came up with nothing, so I went along. What were they going to do, kill me after I’d given them beer?
Me: Ok, I’ll go grab a few more.
John: Wait, I’ll come with you.
Me: It’s just right there. I can —
John: I’m coming. Let’s go.
We walked 2 blocks to the store I’d previously been in and grabbed four of the same 20oz. Heineken cans. As I approached the counter, I saw John talking to the clerk, who was handing him a pint of Jack Daniels from the shelf behind the register.
John: Let’s get this too. And some Cheetos. I haven’t had Puffs in like 15 years.
I thought, “What the fuck does he mean by that? Was he away somewhere? WHY WOULD HE NOT HAVE HAD CHEETOS IN SO LONG?”.
Me: Yeah, fine, just total it up. But that’s it. I need have dinner soon and I can’t get that drunk.
I lied. That was exactly my plan.
John: Sure. Of course. You’ll get to your dinner.
John held the bag as we walked back to the beach. We’d only just exchanged names, and I was already 30 Euros in the hole. What little leverage I had was gone.
John: Sam got us food and drinks!
Everyone rejoiced, except me. John pulled the bottle of Jack out and took a big swig, handing it to me after.
John: Here, have some.
Me: Oh, no. I’m good. I don’t even like Jack that much.
John: You’re not going to drink with me…?
Me: I mean, I bought it. That must count for something, no?
John: Still, rude.
I took the bottle and wiped the mouthpiece.
Me: (sarcastically) Is that rude too?
I took a swig and looked back at John. For the first time I noticed the burn marks around his mouth. He saw me staring.
John: Don’t worry, they’re burns, not herpes.
Me: That’s good… Or bad… I’m not sure what you want me to say.
John: My parents burned me.
I ignored him, hoping the subject would change, or a plane would fall out of the sky and crush us all into mush.
John: That’s why I killed them.
I looked up hoping to see the plane. Nothing. Carlos and Aaron were still sitting silently, sharing their beer. They didn’t even look particularly bothered or uncomfortable. All just terrible, terrible signs.
John: I’m not joking, I killed them both.
Me: I believe you. No disagreements here.
John: You can Google it when you get back to your hostel.
He pointed to my hostel, which he’d apparently seen me come from. Another awful sign.
Me: No need. I believe you.
John: Seriously. Give me your book.
He reached out and snatched the book from me, removing the pen I used as a bookmark. He opened it to the last page. That’s when I noticed his nails. They were caked in weeks’ worth of sand and dirt, and there were sores everywhere. He handed me the book back and I looked down at it. It read: “John _____.”
John: Just Google that name and the word “murder,” and it’ll come right up.
Me: Gotcha. Will do. Thanks John.
Just as I slunk back down into the sand, John took another swig of Jack Daniels and yelled, “Hey, check this out!” before tackling Aaron to the ground. It quickly escalated to a fight. People were looking on, but no one seemed to care enough to jump in. People don’t really break up homeless people fights, do they?
Sitting next to Carlos, away from the other two, I tried to gather more intel. Unfortunately, Carlos barely spoke any English. I had some experience from high school and working in kitchens so I did what I could with what I had.
Me: Los conoces?
Carlos: Los conoci hoy.
Apparently, Carlos had just met John and Aaron that day. “What the fuck is going on here?” I asked myself, “I thought they were a roaming band of brothers.” I knew what I had to do at that point; I needed to separate Carlos and I from the murderer(s) before we met a similar fate.
Me: Quiero escaper de ellos conmigo?
I asked him if he wanted to escape with me.
Carlos: Si.
I looked over at John and Aaron. They were still fighting, now even closer to the shoreline, about 100 feet away. I slowly started to gather my stuff, leaving the Cheetos and booze behind as to not raise suspicions.
I looked at Carlos. Surprisingly, we seemed to have an understanding.
Me: Sigueme.
He followed me and we walked as nonchalantly as possible, too scared to glance back. I picked up the pace once we hit the cobblestone road.
Me: Only, 20 more paces. Please, God, don’t let that murderer turn around.
We rounded the corner together then peeked back. John still had Aaron in a headlock. They were all twisted up. We were safe. Carlos looked at me and we both sighed. Then we broke out into laughter, delirious from the fear. Or at least that’s why I was laughing. I wasn’t sure why he was, given he probably didn’t understand John’s admission. I thought about trying to explain it to him in Spanglish but decided against it. Hell, I didn’t even want to know.
The Adderall was wearing off, and I still wanted shellfish, so, in a giant leap of faith, I asked Carlos out to dinner. There I go again.
Me: Tienes hambre? Voy a pagar.
I offered to pay.
Carlos: Por que, no?
He was in.
We walked down a street parallel to the beach, trying to get to know each other. From what I gathered; he was homeless. He was a mechanic by trade, but currently not working. He used to stay with his mother, but that bridge had burned. The only thing he’d eaten that day were the Cheetos.
He spoke pridefully, not seeming to have been broken by the world yet. He had a confident smile and looked me directly in my eyes when he addressed me. That’s always important. He’d lived a lot of life for a 20-year-old but seemed up for the fight.
We passed a couple of oceanfront restaurants before I chose one with a patio that opened to a small dock. It was a lovely place, perhaps too lovely for some underdressed fellas like us. Regardless, we were welcomed in without judgement.
Have you ever seen the scene in The Wire where Bunny Colvin takes the corner kids to Ruth’s Chris, and they don’t know how to behave because of the culture shock? When Carlos accidentally shattered a wine glass, I felt like Bunny, conducting a misguided social experiment. Who was it all for, me or Carlos?
When Carlos came back from cleaning and bandaging his thumb, I ordered us a variety of shellfish, along with a paella to share. I figured we might as well fill our bellies regardless of the awkwardness. And that we did. For the next hour we sat in relative silence, stuffing our faces like garbage-can racoons. The food couldn’t have been better, same as the wine, which I continued to order until there was nothing left on our plates, three bottles in total.
Drunk and extremely full, I paid the waiter and thanked him repeatedly for putting up with us. Then, we exited towards the beach.
That would have been a good time to end the night, I know. But then, I did what I always do.
Me: Donde esta la mota?
Of course, I asked him to find me weed. I knew it was risky, but I was almost out and still had enough Adderall to last for 2 weeks. I needed it. That’s the problem with balancing drugs; if you don’t have enough of one, you can’t fully enjoy the other. I know, it’s madness.
Carlos: Si, Seguro. Necesitamos un taxi.
I got us a taxi and Carlos gave the driver directions.
We drove for much longer than I expected, almost 30-minutes, all of which I spent rationalizing the situation. “Maybe this is where the best weed is? Yeah, that’s probably it… Carlos won’t set you up, you just bought him the meal of a lifetime… At least you have a knowledgeable liaison if things go sideways…”
When we pulled up to our destination, I knew I was in trouble. There were large brick buildings, with bars on the windows, and a centralized courtyard. It was a fucking housing project. Carlos took me to the goddamn projects. Granted, I didn’t tell him the projects were off limits, but for fuck’s sake.
When I exited the car, everyone loitering in front of the building turned to me. They pointed and laughed at my pale legs. I must have looked like an alien to them. My confidence was shot.
Carlos: (hand out) Treinta Euros.
I went in my pocket and gave him the money. He placed it in his underwear and took off into the housing projects.
Me: (sarcastically, to no one) I guess I’ll just chill here with my new friends.
I waited out front of the building, pacing back and forth, smoking cigs, trying to think of an exit plan in case the situation went even more haywire. I popped another 10mg of Adderall too, realizing the night may still be young. A few guys yelled things at me in Spanish, but no one seemed like they wanted to take it to the next level. Still, I was so fucking paranoid.
Then I saw Carlos. He came out of the building with his thumb up and motioned for me to follow. When we got to a more secluded area, he pulled the goods out of his underwear. I was relieved to see a plastic baggie filled with approximately 3.5 grams of green, seedless weed.
Me: WOW! Great job Carlos.
Carlos: De nada, amigo.
He handed me the weed, then pulled a joint from his pocket. I was happy that he didn’t pull it from his pants, but I was confused. “Did he have it the whole time? Was it a freebie from the drug dealer?”.
Before I could contemplate any longer, Carlos lit the joint, took a hit, and passed it to me. I took a hit too and immediately started coughing. I took another hit and did the same. The taste was weird and it made a crackling sound with each puff. “Huh, never seen that happen beeeefffooooor.”
It was at this point I realized that, to my surprise, I was not smoking weed. I was smoking angel dust. The hallucinations started almost instantly. I could barely stand. Carlos, realizing that I was unstable, came to my aid.
Me: Whaaaat wwwaaasss thaaaat?
He leaned in closer, his arm propping me up.
Carlos: I kiss?
His question half-sobered me. Then he leaned in further, his lips pursed.
Carlos: I kiss?
I pushed him away.
Me: No! You do not kiss!!! What the fuck?!
He was pissed. I turned and ran as fast as I could toward the main road where we’d entered the housing project. I looked back and saw Carlos chasing me, screaming at the top of his lungs like a madman.
Carlos: I kiss! I kiss!
I jumped in the first taxi I saw. Carlos was only 40 feet behind us and gaining speed. In my state, it looked like there were 2 of him.
Me: (to driver) VA! VA! VA!
Driver: Tranquillo, senor.
Carlos: (banging on the window) Kiss!! Kiss!!
Me: (to driver) Tranquillo!?! FUCKING DRIVE. VAAAAAAAAA!!
The driver took off and fearfully sped away with Carlos still sprinting behind us. I looked back at him, my heart pounding. He was feral.
Me: Sea Hostel, por favor, y lo siento.
He looked at me quizzically in the rear-view mirror, I think because he assumed I was skipping out on a prostitute without paying. I’m not sure, but it was certainly a look of judgment.
We rode in silence, the cabbie alternating his gaze between me and the road. I kept checking my pulse but lost count of the beats every time my eyes fixated on the bright lights outside my window. I was still hallucinating, but I was at least beginning to calm down.
I had the driver drop me off a few blocks away from my hostel so I could scope out the area before entering. I needed to make sure John wasn’t waiting for me out front to knife me. I wouldn’t have put it passed him. I mean, he slept on the beach only a few hundred feet away and knew I’d be returning at some point.
High out of my mind, I tiptoed quietly up to the front door and slid in. The front desk person saw me and looked concerned.
Guy: Are you ok? Is someone after you?
Me: I think I’m high on PCP. Long story… If a guy named John comes looking for me, tell him I went to Portugal.
Guy: Umm… Ok. How come?
Me: Do me a favor. Please Google “J-O-H-N, _-_-_-_-_-_-_ , M-U-R-D-E-R”
Guy: Why?
Me: I just want to see something.
Guy: It says he killed his parents when he was 16. Do you know him?
Me: May I please check out?

April 13, 2006
The next morning, I woke up feeling like I’d recently smoked PCP and almost made out with a homeless person, which I had, so before eating, I walked a mile to a more private beach and plunged myself into the ocean for a literal baptism. Like Lady McBeth though, no matter how hard I scrubbed, the stain of the previous night wouldn’t come out. In 18 hours, I’d managed to turn my PG-rated redemption story into an R-rated horror film. I’d missed the mark, by A LOT. I needed to get my act together and stop trusting everyone. And I definitely needed to stop hanging out with vagrants. I’ve always had a penchant for hanging out with homeless people. I remember going to a Bar Mitzvah in downtown Chicago when I was 13, and instead of dancing inside with everyone, I took a 2-hour walk around the city and mixed it up with homeless people. Spiritually, I relate. I think it’s the pain that attracts me. Or maybe it’s because I too cannot hold down a job.
Breakfast went down, then came right up, like I assumed it would, so I went to the same shop I did the previous day to get some Tums. The same clerk was working.
Me: Have you seen the guy I was with yesterday again today?
Clerk: John?
Me: You know him?
Clerk: He’s in here every day.
Me: Have you seen him today?
Clerk: (Smiling mischievously) Not yet.
Then, I felt a hand touch my shoulder.
John: Sam! Where’d you go yesterday? You and Carlos just ran off.
Me: I wasn’t sure how long you and Aaron would be fighting, so we went out to dinner.
John: You didn’t invite me?
Me: Sorry, man.
John: Did you Google me?
Me: I did. You weren’t lying.
John: Lying is a sin.
Me: I’m going to take off now.
John: Where to next?
Me: Portugal. Then Russia.
John: Well, it was nice meeting you. You mind buying me some more Jack before you go?
Me: Um… sure.
I paid the cashier, like the pushover I am.
John: Carlos is on the beach, you want to say hi?
Me: No. I gotta go. Madrid awaits.
John: Don’t you mean Portugal?
Me: That’s right, Portugal.
John: You’re not lying, are you?
Me: No, I meant Portugal. I’m going to Portugal.
John: Remember, lying is a sin.
Me: Ok, I’m going to Madrid. My train leaves tonight.
I lied again.
John: Don’t worry, I’m not going to follow you.
Me: Uh, good. It was nice meeting you.
I lied again.
John: Same.
I left the store and booked it to the train station without looking back. Madrid, I thought, was where I’d have to find my redemption.

Who is the greatest football team of all time?
Many people would answer this question with the FC Barcelona in 2010/11. During that season, they won the Champions League, the Spanish League and the Spanish Supercopa. It was a truly successful season. However, there were equal or more successful Barcelona sides in the club’s history. It wasn’t about trophies that made this squad special. Instead, their style of play stood out to others.
Pep Guardiola created a position-based team. Every player knew where to position himself in any given scenario. This positioning enabled Barcelona to control the game. They could hold possession for long periods and therefore have stability.
As the coach himself once said: “Stability is the ball. It’s not to defend 40 meters behind or up front, or high pressing or defend deep or long balls, to be stable as a team is the ball” (Guardiola).
Furthermore, their way of using possession was truly fascinating. Barcelona didn’t just have the ball in sake of having the ball. They constantly seeked for superiority to eventually create chances. It was sometimes slower and sometimes faster, but every pass had an intention.
This article aims to find out, why this Barcelona side is often called the greatest of all time. It mostly covers their in-possession phase as that was most special. But don’t get me wrong, their pressing was incredible too. Nevertheless, most people associate this squad with their possession phase. In the end of this article, I’m shortly going to analyse their counterpressing and why it was so strong.
As already mentioned, the positioning of the players was the most important to create this dominance in their possession phase.
“It’s a game of position, not possession!” (Torrent)
Barcelona’s structure created a lot of diagonal passing lanes and a good distribution all over the pitch. This enabled them to have the ball, progress further up and create chances.
On paper, it was a 4–3–3. But in possession, it was very unusual and asymmetric. It is difficult to describe it with numbers, so let’s have a look on each players role.
Let’s start with the back line of four. The centre backs stayed in the centre and the half-spaces. Besides them, the fullbacks positioned themselves asymmetrically. The right back (usually Alves) moved high up the pitch, nearly playing like a winger. On the left (mostly Abidal) usually stayed deeper. He only moved up on a few occasions, which I will mention later.
The central defensive midfielder (usually Busquets) was the anchor in the midfield. He had a less flexible role than the other midfielders higher up. Busquets mostly stayed in the centre in front of the centre backs and would make horizontal movements. Rarely, he moved higher up.
The two 8s, Xavi and Iniesta also positioned themselves asymmetrically to each other. Xavi on the right played deeper, sometimes besides Busquets to control the game. On the left, Iniesta moved higher up in the left half-space.
The wingers (usually Pedro and Villa) also had different roles. The right winger mostly moved into the right half-space to open the wing for Alves. The left winger usually stayed wide, to open the left half-space for Iniesta.
Lastly, the heart of the squad was their striker, Lionel Messi. He played as a false nine, meaning he constantly dopped deep to connect with the midfield. He often had a tendency, to drop in front of Xavi, to make use of the opened space by the deeper positioning of the Spaniard. Although, Messi’s role was more or less free and he could move wherever he wanted to.
The structure mostly remained the same. It was important that the positions/spaces are occupied, not who occupied them. Most of the time, it looked like in the image above. Though, rotations could occur, meaning the structure could vary for a short period. I will go into detail on these rotations later.
Although, sometimes the structure changed slightly for longer periods, but the principles always remained the same. One change in the structure was e.g., both fullbacks high and wide and both wingers in the half-spaces. This happened mostly when Maxwell played on the left as he is more attacking-minded than Abidal. At this variation, Iniesta would be a little bit deeper.
Only few opponents forced Barcelona to build up deep, as the opposition was often feared of giving more spaces to the midfielders. They therefore sacrificed pressure on the first line of Barcelona’s build-up.
But if the opposition sometimes pressed higher, to put pressure on the centre backs, Barcelona could often easily bypass them.
When pressing higher, most opponents used two players to press Barca’s centre backs. In the deep build-up, Barcelona could use the keeper (Valdes) as the free man, to create a 3v2 overload. The centre backs then would often split wide and deep, to give Valdes more time and space.
The usage of the keeper often had many positive effects to Barcelona’s build-up play. A backwards pass and a pass to the keeper are often pressing triggers for most opponents. This usually led to a striker, who initially marked a centre back, pressing Valdes. Then, the centre back would be the free man.
Even better for Barcelona could be, after a forward, who initially marked a centre back and then pressed on Valdes, another player would take the centre back over. This would again leave a new player free, in a higher position.
This scenario didn’t happen that often, though it showed that Barcelona always had an answer to what the opponent tried to do.
But as already mentioned, most opponents played deeper against Barcelona and would leave the first line free or less pressed.
Still, an overload in the first line was often created, to progress the ball cleaner into higher zones.
Against one striker, the centre backs would naturally have a 2v1 overload, meaning no change in the structure was necessary.
Against two forwards, even though they didn’t press that much, Barcelona liked to have an 3v2 overload. There were a few ways to create the back three:
One was to have Busquets dropping between both centre backs. The centre backs would then move wider and the fullbacks pushed higher up. This enabled the centre backs to be free, have bigger spaces and dribble forwards with the ball.
Sometimes, Xavi dropped between the centre backs or besides one centre back, to create a back three.
The second big way was to use a deeper fullback. Abidal would often stay deeper, to form a temporary back three. This again enabled the centre backs to dribble forward as they had more cover. Moreover, the deep position of Abidal often pulled the opposition’s winger higher, meaning more space were created in the midfield.
As already mentioned, a back three enables the halfbacks to move forward with the ball as they have more cover. This advancing can be very beneficial, to unsettle a deep block.
Many teams aren’t prepared what to do if a centre back starts to dribble with high pace towards them. This quick change of dynamics gave Barcelona an advantage.
One obvious advantage is that by simply moving forwards with the ball, Barcelona was nearer to the opposition goal. Furthermore, it can create a free man or spaces. Any opponent has to press the advancing centre back, no matter what. If no one does, he could dribble freely to the opponent’s goal.
So, one player has to leave his initial marker to press the advancing centre back. This leaves one player unmarked. Either the advancing centre back can directly pass to him, or through another way. Barcelona is incredibly good at finding the free man. Something I will cover more later on.
This is why dribbling is so important for Guardiola: “My first question is always, ‘Can this guy dribble?’ I only want players who have that skill so that’s always what I look at. I want full backs and central defenders and midfielders and inside forwards and winger who can dribble. Because you can learn control and good passing…So, yeah, dribbling, that’s the key.” (Guardiola)
Now that we know, how Barcelona was able to get past the first line of pressure, let’s have a look on how they tried to progress the ball and get into valuable zones to eventually create chances.
First of all, with four players in the midfield (Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta and Messi), Barcelona often had an overload there. These four players mostly formed a box shape or an asymmetrical diamond.
The overload helped Barcelona to find a free player in the centre/half-spaces (the most valuable zones).
Sometimes, the overload was enough, to find the free player. Although, Barcelona also used some interesting mechanisms to find him if it wasn’t that easy.
Now, let’s have a look on some ways to find the free man:
As already mentioned, Barcelona used clever rotations and movements, to unsettle the opposition and eventually create a free man.
You can see the most basic rotation on the image above. Xavi moved deeper, nearly besides Busquets. This allowed Iniesta to move up. Moreover, Messi dropped deeper (mostly in front of Xavi) to create a box structure.
The movement of Xavi usually pulled a midfielder out of position. This opened more space for Messi in between the lines.
We could also often see Busquets making a horizontal movement slightly to the left. This could drag an opponent to the side, which opened space for Xavi to drop into and receive in a deep playmaking position, where he was especially strong.
This rotation occurred mostly, but all in all the midfield box was highly fluid. Sometimes it looked like a box and sometimes like a diamond. Though, the structure wasn’t the most important. What was most important was to create superiorities, find the free man and eventually progress towards the goal.
The fluidity and the rotations had many positive effects and intentions:
The players constantly moved in relation to each other. One big intention was to open passing lanes. Movements could drag defenders out of position, which opened passing lanes and spaces for other players.
The second intention was to move into these open spaces. The midfielders had such an incredible understanding of time and space. They dynamically occupied open spaces. This created a factor of unpredictability and made them harder to mark.
Every midfielder could occupy every space if it had an intention for the collective. That’s why Busquets could also sometimes move into higher zones, to occupy open spaces. The players always moved in relation to each other, therefore, someone needed to occupy Busquets’ central defensive midfield position if he moved up.
Furthermore, the rotations often forced man-oriented opponents to decide between strictly marking or handing over. This is a difficult task to handle. Therefore, a mixture of both often occurred and a player would be free.
Barcelona kept on performing these rotations until a player would eventually receive the ball with time and space. Though, these rotations weren’t the only mechanisms to progress further up.
Barcelona combined the movements with quick combinations, as you can see above. That’s were their famously known Tiki-Taka comes into play.
Sometimes it looked like that they just passed to each other to simply have the ball, but again, every pass had an intention.
“The intention is not to move the ball, rather to move the opposition.” (Guardiola)
The aim of Tiki-Taka, as seen on the quote above was always to manipulate the opponent in a way, to open spaces and create a free player.
Through their structure, Barcelona had small distances in the midfield, which enabled quick combinations that are difficult to defend. The Barcelona players were the best in the world, to execute those combinations.
At the quick combinations, the midfielders and Messi constantly moved related to each other, as already mentioned. Often in the box structure, but also even more fluid, when spaces were somewhere else.
The short passes attracted pressure. Especially, if Barcelona passed to a player with a backwards-facing view. This is often a pressing trigger for the opposition. The opponent thinks he can steal the ball from the player with the suboptimal view, but that’s not the case. The Barcelona player often made a one touch pass, to get out of the pressure. Therefore, the positioning around this player was important to create passing lanes. That’s where the rotations came into play.
When the opponent pressed the Barcelona player with the backwards-facing view, spaces somewhere else open and could be exploited by another player.
Moreover, due to the small distances, many opponents just pressed through and left their initial opponent free, to press another one. Due to Barcelona’s great structure and the mechanisms as already mentioned, they were able to find this free player.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is that the free man should always be supported, to progress further up and use his potential correctly. The midfielders always had that in mind. Their rotations helped the free man to either have more space or a passing option.
Another movement I’d like to mention, which isn’t necessarily a rotation, is the dropping to the side-line performed by Iniesta. This movement can have two effects.
Iniesta could either receive himself with space or he dragged an opponent to the side, opening spaces in the half-space.
Another rotation we often saw was a winger (mostly the right winger) switching positions with Messi. The winger then moved centrally to pin the opponent’s centre backs. This allowed Messi the move around even more.
It was mostly the right winger as he is usually positioned in the half-space and the right fullback occupied the right-wing zone. Meaning no real change in the structure occurred, but different player profiles had different positions.
The opponent often didn’t know how to react to this switch accordingly. The opposition’s fullback was usually tasked marking the winger and the centre backs marked Messi. Now, with the rotations, the opponent couldn’t carry out this task.
This dilemma combined with the high and dynamic role of the right back often forced the back line to leave Messi free and give him even more spaces than in a central position.
This rotation sometimes occurred surprisingly or Barcelona kept this switch of positions for longer periods.
On an individual level, there were two other major ways on how to find and create a free man:
The first was dribbling. I mentioned the dribbling of the centre backs, but also in the midfield, dribbles were very important to progress and eventually create chances.
In the centre, Barcelona didn’t just have the best creators, but also the best dribblers of all time. Players like Messi and Iniesta constantly waved through the opposition with their breath-taking dribbles. But again, this wasn’t just to show off. It also had an intention.
Their dribbles would attract pressure. When a player bypasses an opponent through a dribble, another player has to step up to press the dribbler. This creates spaces and potentially a free man somewhere else. Messi and Iniesta would often bypass numerous opponents and be surrounded by a lot of players.
The other individual way to find and create a free man were disguised passes. This refers to faking a pass to one player and then passing to another. The opponents can be manipulated for example through the view of the eyes or the body position.
This guides the opponent to a wrong passing option. The opponent often moves to the fake passing option, leaving the real one free.
All midfielders, but especially Busquets were masters at this skill.
Another way, to attract pressure were backwards passes. A backwards pass doesn’t gain space. Though, it can be the beginning of a new and better attack. Backwards passes attract pressure as the team with the ball doesn’t move nearer to the goal.
“[…] a back pass does not indicate fear, but the beginning of another, better play.” (Guardiola)
Mostly, only few players of the opponent move up after a backwards pass. This is dangerous, as these players leave their deeper positions, which can open space between the lines if the other teammates don’t move up.
If the whole team moves up after a backwards pass, spaces between the lines stay narrow and therefore difficult to access. Though, spaces behind can enlarge. If the forwards exploit these spaces, they have a dynamical advantage as the opposition just moved forwards.
Especially for Barcelona, the ability to attract pressure was very important as many opponents just sat deep and tried to defend with eleven players. Being able to constantly manipulate the opponent was a big factor of their incredible in-possession phase.
Sometimes, these mechanisms weren’t enough and Barcelona wasn’t able to get into valuable zones. This mostly happened if the opponent tried to congest the centre with as many players as possible.
The opponents would either use four midfielders or their wingers tucking inside (this occurred more often). This obviously helped the opponents to control the centre and give Barcelona’s midfielders less time and space.
But this led to another problem. By congesting the centre, spaces wide enlarged. This is also why Guardiola always wanted to have both wing zones occupied.
Through the constant occupation of both wing zones (mostly by the wingers or fullbacks), Barcelona could stretch the opposition and had always a passing option wide if the centre was congested.
Sometimes, Barcelona could purposefully play wide. An example would be the overload to isolate principle. This refers to creating an overload on one side of the pitch and then switching to the other side, to create a 1v1 there.
Barcelona often combined the switches with the pinning of the ball-far fullback. This would create even more spaces wide.
Barcelona had amazing wingers and fullbacks with incredible dribbling and crossing abilities. So, it wasn’t really a downgrade compared to going centrally. Nevertheless, Barcelona preferred to go through the middle.
“You have the ball on one side, to finish on the other.” (Guardiola)
Similar to the overload to isolate principle, generally Barcelona used a lot of switches to progress and create chances. Often, the opponents were able to have good local compactness at a specific area and stopped Barcelona from progress. From here, backwards passes and switches were very important.
I already wrote about why backwards passes are so important and why Barcelona used them. Something I didn’t mention was the position of a relay player. This refers to a player who positions himself behind others, to be a back pass option. Combined with the wing zone, Pep Guardiola always wanted to have this space/position occupied.
When being stuck on the wing, a backwards pass option can be highly important. That’s where the relay player comes into play. He usually positioned himself behind the wide player and in the half-space. This was near enough to the wide player and near enough to stay connected with the other players to potentially switch the point of attack.
As seen on an image earlier, which I used to represent a backwards pass, Alves is the relay player in the right half-space. Though, mostly a midfielder (Xavi & Iniesta) provided this back pass option. Sometimes the fullback would stay deeper in the relay player position.
Another position which is very important to be able to switch is the link playing position. Guardiola too always wanted to have this position/space occupied. The link player was mostly positioned centrally in front of the block. He can be the immediate option for the relay player or the player to play a switch to the other side.
Again, it didn’t matter who occupied this space unless it was occupied. But it was mostly Busquets, who positioned himself there. Sometimes, an 8 could occupy this space.
The link player is very similar to the relay player, as he can also be a back pass option. Though, he is positioned differently and even more important for a successful switch.
Many teams congested specific areas. Being able to switch the point of attack elsewhere had many positive effects. Due to those switches, the opponent constantly had to shift across. Sooner or later, the opponent just makes a mistake. For example, someone pushed up to far or someone didn’t move to the other side accordingly.
Although, the act of switching alone isn’t really effective. Sometimes, it can open spaces and create a free man, but mostly it’s about the following action. After a switch, it’s important to support the receiver and force the opponent to make as many decisions as possible.
This quote from Adin Osmanbasic summarizes best Barcelona’s way on how to find the free man: “The goal is to find the free or unmarked man by moving the ball, positioning, or player movement” (Osmanbasic).
Another big chance creation method was combined with Messi’s dropping movement in a false nine position. His dropping move often pulled a centre back out of position, opening spaces in behind. Immediately, as Messi dropped deep, other players (mostly wingers) started to make diagonal runs in behind, to exploit this space.
Villa and Pedro were very fast and had a great timing. Therefore, these runs often caused the opposition big troubles. They also looked to make these runs on the blindside of the opposition, making them even more effective.
Messi could then use his outstanding passing qualities to pick a run of his teammates. Sometimes, Messi would lay it off to another teammate who then could find the running players with a forward-facing view.
This chance creation method mostly was successful against opponents with a high defensive line. But it could also be seen to attack crosses in this way.
Everything I mentioned in this chapter combined forced the opponent to make as many decisions as possible. No matter what the opposition tried to do, Barcelona always seemed to have an answer and the opponent more and more questions.
I’d like to finish this section with a quote from the famous basketball player Stephen Curry, which perfectly describes Barcelona’s aim in possession: “The main goal is to just make the defense make as many decisions as you can so that they’re going to mess up at some point with all that ball movement and body movement and whatnot” (Curry).
As already mentioned in the introduction, I will now analyse Barcelona’s counterpressing. Yes, this article should mainly cover Barcelona’s in-possession phase, but their counterpressing was outstanding and it is also connected to the in-possession phase as the structure decides if the counterpressing is successful. Moreover, as Barcelona mostly wanted to have possession, their counterpressing was very important to immediately win the ball back.
“Without the ball, we are a disastrous team, a horrible team, so we need the ball.” (Guardiola)
The most important factor of Barcelona’s counterpressing was probably their structure. They always aimed to have small distances to each other. These small distances were a key part of their in-possession phase. As already mentioned, they used small distances to be able to make quicker combinations. Moreover, the different local overloads in possession also led to small distances to each other. This is a good starting point, but that’s not enough for a successful counterpressing. Let’s dive a little bit deeper.
“It’s about how you place yourself in relation to the others on the field when you have the ball and where you should be so that you can continue pressing when you lose it.” (Domènec Torrent)
@roshanrao_ on Twitter used an interesting approach on how to analyse the counterpressing from Manchester City here:
I will also use it a little bit to get a better understanding why Barcelona’s counterpressing was so good.
Basically, @roshanrao_ divides the structure around the counterpressing action into three zones:
“1. Zone of intervention — immediate engagement takes place on the ball
2. Zone of mutual help — support around the ball through numerical superiority
3. Zone of cooperation — Hold positions for width and depth” (@roshanrao_)
Let’s start with the first zone, the zone of intervention. This refers to immediately applying pressure on the ball-carrier after the ball is lost. Barcelona’s players instantly pressed the opponent after a ball loss with full pace. Mostly, the one or two nearest players would sprint towards the ball-carrier. Although, it wasn’t always about winning the ball back immediately. Sometimes, the presser ran through or looked to guide the opponent into a specific area.
Often it was just important to seemingly put the opponent under pressure even though the Barcelona player couldn’t win the ball back. This led to hesitation and often a mistake from the opponent.
Furthermore, it isn’t just important that immediate pressure is applied. The players also need to anticipate counterpressing actions quickly. The Barcelona players were masters at this. They constantly had in mind what would happen if the ball would be lost. Pressing triggers such as a Barcelona player with a bad body posture, a teammate under pressure or a great run from the opponent were signs to apply pressure. The Barcelona players would then slowly move over and backwards to be prepared for the counterpressing action but also for a potential counterattack from the opponent.
Secondly, the zone of mutual help. This refers to the players who position themselves around the ball to provide support and stability but at first don’t directly apply pressure. The occupation of this zones is very important as some teams can come through the zone of intervention. Players in the zone of mutual help can also act as a second wave.
At Barcelona, mostly around three or more players would occupy this zone. They looked to control the space around the ball by using the cover-shadow and often positioned themselves between the opponents. Also, the positioning on different vertical and horizontal lines helped to control the area.
Moreover, if Barcelona won the ball back, players in the zone of mutual help were often the first players who were seeked to play out of the congested area. Counterpressing actions are often very narrow and random. Having players positioned to get out of this space was also key.
Thirdly, the zone of cooperation refers to players who are positioned even further away. The aim of these players is to provide cover if the opponent can break through the first and second zone, e.g., with a long ball. Additionally, these players can also be outlet options after the ball is won from the counterpressing action.
This zone was usually occupied by the centre backs, the ball-far fullback and a midfielder to provide cover for a potential transition. Moreover, forwards would also be positioned in this zone to be the outlet and to transition forward after the ball was won back.
Sometimes, the structure wasn’t ideal or the opponent could play themselves out of the pressure. If this happened, usually the nearest player would still apply pressure and the other players would fall deep to provide cover.
This Barcelona side wasn’t just beautiful to watch, but also incredibly effective. Pep Guardiola brought the possession-based philosophy to the world of football and started an evolution. His Barcelona team was feared but also admired at the same time around the globe.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is the individual quality of this squad. Without these outstanding players, it wouldn’t be impossible to achieve all this. Though, it’s the role of the coach to fit them into a functioning and effective system. Pep Guardiola definitely established this and should therefore be respected.
I hope you enjoyed this article! It’s my first piece on Medium, so I wanted to make something special. Moreover, I hope that this article was detailed enough but not too long at the same time.

This post was created by Avery V., one of LearnLux’s 2018 Campus Ambassadors. All experiences & opinions are her own.
When researching the “minimal expenses” one can expect for a study abroad experience… I was blown away.
Apartment $1,200/ monthGroceries ~ $100/ weekRestaurants ~ $30/weekTravel ~ $250–400 Miscellaneous ~ $200/month
Total Average Cost per month ~ $2100
I thought to myself, how the hell am I supposed to afford blowing through 2,100 dollars at the “minimum” per month?
I try to be as financially independent as I can, therefore I worked last summer as well as through the first semester of my Junior year to prepare for study abroad. However, even with the past cash-flows, there was no way I was going to be able to afford such an expensive per-month price tag!
For six months in Barcelona, I was supposed to have, at minimum, 12,600 dollars? There HAD to be another way…
I decided to do some research and figure out how to slim down this budget. Prior to arrival, I decided to break down my weekly and monthly expenses.
Let’s think…I have both fixed and variable expenses. Fixed= something that is of a consistent value that is pre-planned ahead of time. Think of an apartment expense, a gym membership, or a prescription cost. My fixed expenses were: my apartment and my gym membership.
Next I began thinking about my variable costs. Variable expenses= a cost that can change depending on the amount and frequency payment of a good or a service. Think of groceries, going out at night, or impromptu purchases. My variable costs were: groceries, restaurants, shopping, bulk buys (makeup or household supplies), entertainment activities (ex: going to movies), daily transportation (Taxis, Uber, local busses), and so many others.
While in Barcelona, I expect to have a complete new category: Travel. The exciting, pivotal, and expen$ive component of the studying abroad experience. Between flights, trains, transportation, food, activities, and special moments, I made sure to be realistic in my budgeting for travel plans.
Lost and confused, I turned to my dad who helped me see more clearly. As a Financial Advisor for the past 30 years, he sure gave me advice (some I liked and others less so). He basically reiterated the importance of frugality, especially as a college student without continuous income. He loved Calvin Coolidge’s quote:
“There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no independence quite so important, as living within your means.”
He then broke it down with an example featuring the smallest of purchases: Coffee.
“So Avery, let’s say you go to Starbucks or Dunkin three mornings a week to grab a coffee before class. Thats roughly $4/ day and $12/week. If you do this 52 weeks of the year… that is $624 on coffee alone! Now, lets extrapolate that to your 4 years of college. If you were to only have 3 morning coffee’s for your time in college, that is $ 2,496. And that is just coffee…”
Wow. He definitely has a point considering I get coffee 4 days a week and pay an extra .50 cents for almond milk!
This conversation sparked a whole new perspective. I do not need to get caught up in our culture heavily fixated on the consumption of unnecessary goods. I do not need to cut coffee out of my diet. Instead, I can buy $10 coffee grounds that will make over 70 cups of coffee. I began to apply this mentality to EVERYTHING.
Here are the changes I made, that ended up making a big difference:
1. I switched out American brands for (cheaper) Spanish equivalents2. I found the most affordable grocery store where I could buy in bulk3. I attend farmers markets for my fresh produce, instead of paying over 70% mark up at the close by stores.4. I limited eating out at restaurants and make more food at home (both cheaper and WAY more healthy)5. I ditched that $6 Starbucks order that only increases your spending, as well as your waist size… I see you with your grande double caramel macchiato with one pump mocha syrup, two pumps hazelnut, light ice, chocolate powder, add cinnamon dolce top, with light whipped cream… ya I’m talking to YOU6. I take the very efficient public transportation system in Barcelona. My monthly ticket costs 76 euros and has unlimited swipes. This compares to taking a 5–12 euro cab to each destination.7. I remembered to KEEP IN MIND THE CONVERSION RATE. Currently the dollar to euro rate is 1 dollar= .80 euro. This makes everything even more than the price tag states. Very important to remember.8. I travel with friends! This cuts down the cost of living and allows you the freedom to live in a nicer more central location.
These changes, although small, REALLY lowered my budget for each month. This task reminded me to stay intentional, think about needs vs. wants, plan ahead, and practice being responsible. Everyone can budget and still participate in everything while abroad. Just limit the unnecessary purchases so you can sip on your extra-special latte at the top of the Eiffel tower.

This season, FC Barcelona’s bold defensive strategy has been central to their reclaiming of the La Liga title. At the core of this approach is a high defensive line, meticulously orchestrated to stifle opposition progression. The visualization below plots Offsides Conceded against Opposition Progressive Passing Distance, placing Barça in a distinct and extreme corner of the graph as they conceded by far the most offsides while simultaneously allowing the least progressive passing distance. This is not a coincidence but in fact the natural outcome of one of the most aggressive defensive setups in world football.
Anchored by the positioning and anticipation of Iñigo Martínez and Pau Cubarsí, Barcelona’s high line compresses the pitch, forcing opponents into their own half and encouraging them to attempt risky balls over the top. The result is a flurry of offside calls as attackers struggle to time their runs behind a relentlessly disciplined back line. By stepping up with precision, Barça not only denies space but also disrupts rhythm, collapsing the time and room opponents need to construct meaningful attacks. Progressive passing distance, a key indicator of territorial gain, is dramatically reduced under this pressure.
Naturally, this strategy carries inherent risks. A high defensive line demands elite timing and communication, particularly from central defenders and the goalkeeper. When the long-term injury to first-choice keeper and captain Marc-André ter Stegen threatened the integrity of the system, manager Hansi Flick remained committed to his tactical principles. Emergency signing Wojciech Szczęsny rose to the occasion, helping the team secure an extraordinary 43 points from a possible 45 in the league. Even so, goalkeeping with so much space behind the defence inevitably invites moments of uncertainty, most memorably against Benfica, when Szczęsny collided with Alejandro Balde while charging out to intercept a ball played over the top.
When executed with the precision Barcelona have shown under Flick, the high line becomes a proactive defensive weapon. The high number of offsides conceded is not a sign of disorganisation, but a deliberate, repeatable outcome of a system designed to neutralise threats before they emerge. It is controlled through compression, and over the course of the season, it proved to be remarkably effective.

I realized a long time ago that our lives are like football teams. Everyone needs a good team to have a chance at success.
Ultimately, what brings success is diligence and tactics — a balanced and a realistic plan. Tonight, Barca had everything: a good team, diligence but fell short due to their half baked plan.
Nathaniel Bassey is simply saying;
""know when to go all out and when to be reserved"".
If your plan lacks balance and realism, it is half baked. What Barca did in the last minutes of normal time lacked reality.
In a football team, everyone needs to be diligent at their respective duties to have a shot at success. It is the duty of attackers to create and convert chances while the defenders tighten security and stop attacks.
This applies to reality as well. Your team — which can also be your circle of friends or social circle, needs people who can bring and take opportunities, as well as people who can protect from being extorted. You need someone who understands the game enough to devise plans that drive you forward, as well as people who share the same interest as yours to be dedicated to your course.
Every team needs a good manager (the tactician), an X factor in attack and defense, and the will to succeed:
Be cautious of the team you buildBe cautious of the relationships you keepBe cautious of the circle you keepBe cautious of your aspirations.

In a crowded café on Barcelona’s Plaza Molina, they chant his name, exuberant at the flash of magic. Waiters pound their metal trays on the counter, college students throw their arms in the air, and old men shake their heads in disbelief. Together they shout his name with abandon, over and over again. Messi! Messi! Messi! He’s done it again. On this night, the shining light of Barcelona football has created a moment of legend, the type of play that turns mortal players into a name that is chanted into the night.
I found this café by accident, wandering down the hillside from my flat in Putxet. Plaza Molina, a busy Metro stop, was not my destination. Typically, I strolled past the bustling square on my way into Gràcia, skipping the little restaurants on the border of the plaza filled with commuters and business people stopping for drinks on the way home.
But the lights of a small place on the corner caught my eye. My only goal was to find a place to watch the Barca match and have a beer. The café was small, but I spotted an empty stool at the cramped counter. Drowned by the sound of the announcers booming from the TV, I…

Nearly every European country with a long wine-making tradition produces at least a few sweet wines, some of which have survived the ages and are still considered to be some of the worlds greatest expressions. To this day some Tokaji wines from Hungary, Sauterne from the south of Bordeaux, Trockenbeerenauslese from Germany and others command premium prices, despite the world drinking less fortified and sweet wines than ever before. Spain joins them in the production aspect, if not the price, with a plethora of sweet wine styles from Sherrys, sweet Muscats, Pedro Ximenez, Monastrell and others, and indeed has been making ‘rancio’ style wines since the beginning of our wine making history.
As with all sweet wines, the historical significance is really related to the practical issues of getting them around the world in one piece; going back even a little over a hundred or so years ago, moving a table wine from one country to to another was a good way to risk turning it into unpalatable vinegar. Sweet wines, on the other hand, with their stronger, headier flavours, higher levels of sugar and often higher levels of alcohol due to fortification were the drink of choice, as they would arrive at their destination more or less intact. This was particularly important in warm countries such as Spain, where a single hot day in the baking Mediterranean sunshine is enough to turn your fresh, fruity red wine into something quite dull and uninteresting.
However, with the advent of modern technologies, sweet and fortified wine sales have fallen through the floor over the last 40 years, with most modern consumers opting for lighter, drier wines that are usually a little easier to pair with food. Wines no longer need to be powerful and sweet to survive before being consumed and as a result, the market for sweet wines is dwindling away. One silver lining of this, of course, is that it’s generally the best producers who are left making the remaining wines, and they’ve been recently joined by some ambitious attempts to recreate different styles, often using very new technologies such as cryo-extraction in places not previously renowned for these styles of wine. It was my pleasure to introduce 5 such wines to our tasting last week and showcase the depth of options available in Spain alone, which whilst may not become the mainstay of an individuals collection, certainly have their place at the dinner table.
Gramona “Vi de Glass” Riesling 2011: We kicked off the evening with probably the least traditional style of fortified wine made in Spain; ice wine made not be the natural elements dropping down well below zero, but using a chamber designed to artificially freeze the grapes prior to pressing. This has been a technology used in France since the late 1980s but was started to be used by Gramona in 1997. The premise is identical to that of the natural production of ice wine in both Germany and Canada; freezing the water in the grapes and squeezing out a thick, viscous juice from the resulting press with a lot of varietal flavour, sugar and acid. However, doing this artificially gives a great deal of control over the process as you can choose at which temperature you’d like to freeze the grapes. The higher the concentration of sugar, the lower the temperature needed to freeze the water in the grapes themselves, and the less juice you receive per ton. Therefore, winemakers can now choose the quantity of the icewine they need and adjust the temperature accordingly; lower temperatures mean that only the ripest juice is allowed to leave the press, but lowers quantity substantially. In France the common practice is to freeze grapes at -6ºC. Gramona by comparison choose to make their wine at -15ºC. I was surprised at how good this was, retaining both the youthful fruit and minerality of the Riesling in a good balance with the sugar levels. The bottle is a little difficult to store, but makes for a wonderful centre piece!
Jorge Ordonez №2 Victoria 2015: We went from perhaps the least typical style of Spanish sweet wine to perhaps its most; sweet Muscat from Malaga. DO Malaga is interestingly the only DO in Spain to focus entirely on the production of sweet wine, having been influential in the courts of Medieval Europe and peaking in popularity in the 19th century with its recently revived “Mountain Wine”. Muscat de Alexandria, the ugly ducking to Muscat a Petit Grains, is rife here with its grapey, floral aromas, naturally high sugar and delicate nature. Jorge Ordonez has a range of 4 in total, all made in a naturally sweet style from over-ripe grapes, increasing in sugar level and flavour intensity. We went for number 2, Victoria 2015 which is a lovely, softly honeyed wine with a very approachable 10% ABV and a lovely light, delicately floral character. Of all the wines poured over the evening, this probably lasted the least amount of time in the glass!
Perelada Garntaxa de 12 Anys: Our first meeting with a fortified wine and we went for a sweet Grenache from the Emporda, a region in the very north of Catalunya bordering France. In fact, this proximity to France goes some way to explain the style of this wine, made as it is in a Solera system. The south of France, Roussilon in particular, is home to a great deal of appellations famous for producing sweet wine and the effects are felt in the north of Catalunya, where many of these old constructions still exist and are making top quality wine to this day. This is actually my favourite style of sweet wine from Catalunya, combining the lovely dried red fruit character of the Grenache with the long, slow 12-year ageing process of the Solera system to provide a complex, sweet and very endearing wine as a result. Perelada are a big company producing a lot of very good, and some decidedly average, wine, but I’d be happy to have a few bottles of this lying around at any given time!
Castaño Dulce 2013 — We headed down to the Levant for wine number 4 and a chance to try perhaps the least obviously sweet wine of the day. I say this because the sweet Monastrell, made from grapes dried in the sun and often fermented in open wooded vats, is more akin to a structured red wine with a lot of sugar than a traditional sweet wine. The Castañofamily have been revolutionary in DO Yecla, from helping win the DO regulatory system to investing heavily into opening international markets for the region and with the quality of the wine they’re producing now, I can safely say that it’s been a successful drive for a still relatively unknown area. Bold, bright and tannic, this would be a delicious pairing for medium-strength cheeses, light chocolate desserts and almost anything with red fruit in it.
Don PX Toro de Albala Gran Reserva 1986 — It wouldn’t be a sweet wine tasting if we didn’t dip our toe into the sweetest of them all; Pedro Ximenez, made in DO Montilla-Moriles with almost 380 grams of sugar a litre. Pedro Ximenez is one of the worlds naturally sweetest grape varieties, accumulating sugar rapidly, encouraged by exceptionally late harvesting when they’re essentially raisins on the vine. These dry grapes are then picked, pressed and fermented to a few degrees of alcohol before being fortified to retain this incredible level of sugar. PX, as it’s more commonly known, is still used to sweeten certain wines, often Sherry destined for ‘Cream’ status of some sort, but more often is aged in a Solera system for an incredibly long time, becoming deeply oxidised, concentrated and dark in the process. There are also single vintage PX wines like the above, aged in oak barrels for a staggering 28 years before commercial release. My personal preference is to drizzle this over vanilla ice-cream with walnuts and almonds, but a small glass is also a hedonistic pleasure from time to time!
This was certainly not a tasting for the faint of heart, but a real treat to try so many sweet wines from across the country. The general feeling before the tasting was one of “I don’t really drink sweet wines, so I’m interested to see how they fare.’ Based on the evidence, I hope we’ve converted a few more lovers of dessert wines, the industry certainly needs a few more! If you’d like to learn more about Spanish wine and attend a tasting in Barcelona, make sure to check out the options here, from private tastings to our weekly published tastings. Until then, salut!

The day felt special for many reasons. Firstly, it was the first spring day warm enough to wear shorts outside. Coincidentally, this day happened to be the 23rd of April in Catalunya — otherwise known as Sant Jordi. The streets were filled with book stalls and flower stands, overwhelming the carrers of Barcelona with the smell of paper and roses.
Catalan flags were wrapped around every book stall, hung from balconies, and wrapped in ribbons around the singular roses that would soon be gifted to loved ones. Sant Jordi feels less like a festival for books — it’s a declaration of cultural Catalan pride.
A long time ago, there was a fearsome dragon that wreaked havoc on the inhabitants of a small village in Catalunya called Montblanc. In order to keep the dragon from destroying the village, the townspeople decided they would sacrifice one person every day through a lottery system.

The non remote events are back, which is great!
I had the opportunity to attend for the first one (for me) after the pandemic and I did a little summary to share my thoughts about it.
I am Borja Pernía, a Venezuelan software developer who has lived in Barcelona since 2012. I have been working at ManoMano since January 2020 and I like to assist to different events related to software development.
For personal reasons, I only could assist the first day during the morning and this is the summary of the talks that I assisted.
They talked about the necessity to use OpenTelemetry
Important concepts in observability
First steps into the Voxel implementation
What is OpenTelemetry?
Demo time!
Questions & Answers
Quick overview of data disciplines
The infrastructure for handle data in Hotjar
About data qualityImportant: accuracy, consistency, completeness, timeliness, validity, uniqueness
Lessons learned
As a summary, the talks that I assisted had interesting topics that could help us to improve our day-to-day work in several levels (to know several ways to have a better functional programming experience, to understand how to monitorize our applications in a correct and simpler way or starting to build a BI infrastructure based on the experience of somebody that already lived it).
I enjoyed coming back to a face-to-face event with a great set of speakers, , and a good mood among the crowd. I hope to attend next year’s edition too :)
If you want to continue the conversation about this or other events, contact or chat with me on LinkedIn.
As usual in this kind of events, the opening was a moment to present the team involved and thanked to the sponsors (ManoMano included! \o/ ). Something that was new for me: the post-covid protocol during the event (use of masks, leave the rooms at the end of the talks, etc.) and the presentation of two organizations (BCN women who code and Codebar).

About a month after moving to Barcelona, I learned that one of my co-workers also lived there. I was ecstatic to meet another digital nomad in their 30s. The prospect of meeting someone I enjoyed working with for over a year was even more exciting. I couldn’t wait to see her!
I called a cab, and Uber directed me to Las Ramblas to wait. If you don’t already know this, Las Ramblas is known as “the World’s Most Pickpocketed Street.” I followed my usual precautions and stood with my back against a hotel wall.
As I waited, a gentleman approached. He was young, pulling a large suitcase as he walked toward the hotel’s grand entrance. The person next to him seemed to playfully snatch an item out of his hand. He turned around and grabbed the person by his shirt. They jumped into oncoming traffic to get away.
At first, I thought, “Look at these two fools in the street! They’re about to get hit by a car.”
But then I realized they weren’t friends. It wasn’t two guys roughhousing each other recklessly. One had just been robbed.
It was broad daylight: around 2 PM on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I couldn’t believe it.

It was Christmas time in Barcelona, and I was facing a creature I’d never encountered before: a log with a painted-on smiley face, wearing a Santa hat. This wasn’t Rudolph or Frosty; this was “Tio de Nadal,” and apparently, I was supposed to beat it with a stick. Welcome to Catalonia, right?
That’s how my adventure in Barcelona began — a whirlwind of cultural quirks, language barriers, and unexpected discoveries. My journey started when I followed my husband to his hometown, leaving behind my familiar life in Indonesia. I was a graphic designer by profession, but little did I know that this move would lead me down a new career path and spark a whole new set of passions.
My career started in the vibrant world of children’s publishing, where I worked as an art designer for a foreign magazine with a local editorial team in Indonesia. It was a fun and creative environment, but I soon felt the pull to explore new horizons. That led me to a graphic design and marketing promotion role for a real estate and hospitality company in a different city. This was my first taste of the marketing world, and I quickly realized I had a knack for it.
A few years later, I landed a position as a creative designer and digital marketer for a factory. This was where my fascination with the digital world truly blossomed. I was immersed in website design, social media campaigns, and the ever-evolving landscape of online marketing. And then came AI — the game-changer that sparked a whole new level of curiosity in me. I was hooked!

Learning a new language is like navigating a maze blindfolded. You bump into walls, take wrong turns, and occasionally stumble upon a hidden gem. That’s been my experience with Spanish and Catalan.
Despite my best efforts (and countless hours with Duolingo), my progress has been…let’s just say “gradual.” But I’ve learned to embrace the stumbles, the mispronounced words, and the occasional blank stares. It’s all part of the adventure.
The truth is, my attempts to speak Spanish often end up as a jumbled mix of Spanish, English, and even some Catalan thrown in for good measure. “Spanglish” with a Catalan twist, anyone? But hey, I’m learning, and that’s what matters.
Amidst the linguistic chaos, I found solace in a surprising place: Sashiko and embroidery. These intricate crafts, with their repetitive stitches and calming rhythms, became my refuge. They provided a sense of accomplishment and a way to connect with a new culture through its traditional art forms.
As an introvert, moving to a new city always presents a unique set of challenges. But trading the familiar hustle and bustle of Jakarta and Surabaya for the vibrant energy of Barcelona brought a new dimension to my introverted experience. While both Indonesia and Spain have their own brand of urban energy, the cultural shift and the unfamiliarity of my surroundings amplified my need for solitude. I found myself retreating into the comfort of our house, venturing out mostly for errands or when accompanied by my husband.
But here’s the thing: I didn’t feel lonely.
In fact, I discovered a newfound sense of fulfillment in my solitude. I filled my days with new hobbies, exploring the city at my own pace, and diving deeper into the digital world that fascinated me. I learned to embrace my introversion, finding joy in the quiet moments and the freedom to explore my own interests.
My journey in Barcelona has been a tapestry of unexpected turns, new passions, and personal growth. From accidental digital marketer to “Spanglish”-speaking crafter, I’ve embraced the challenges and discovered new facets of myself along the way. And while my introverted nature might keep me close to home most days, I’ve found a rhythm that works for me, a balance between solitude and connection, exploration and comfort.
I’m constantly learning and adapting, embracing the changes and challenges that come with living in a new country. And I’ve come to realize that the most rewarding part of this journey is not just the destination, but the process itself.
Looking back on my journey, I’ve learned a few valuable lessons:
I hope my story inspires you to embrace change, embrace your individuality, and pursue your passions, no matter where you find yourself in the world.

I like to participate in boutique-like forest trail ultras where there are only a handful of runners but last month I somehow managed to run the Zurich Barcelona Marathon with 16000+ runners signed up.
I usually don't care about my finishing time as any finished ultra is a success for me regardless of time. But now I ran a marathon distance with many other runners and this made me think about the end result.
I found this presentation of my result clean and simple but incredibly boring.
My finishing time was 3:31:44. I'm relatively happy with that time but I know that I got tired in the end. How did that compare to the people around me? How fast are the pro runners compared to me?
I decided to take all the results I could find and write a small program that would give me a more visual overview of the event.
First thoughts:
I also took a look into the finishing times and it seems that people who aimed under 3h and under 4h were pretty successful (no peak after the time in a graph) but it seems that a lot of runners with aim of 2h45min, 3h30min and 4h15min barely missed their mark.
The slower you are, the more you slow down in the second half of the race. People around the 4h finishing time were avg 10% slower in the 2nd half, that means a whopping 24min added.
And the race starts from the 25th km :) Almost everybody is able to hold the pace till 25th km but every next kilometre is getting harder to keep the pace.
Regardless of your results, it's amazing to see so many people running! We are all winners!

Hop on the time machine for a moment. We are going back to 2011. FC Barcelona was arguably the best club in the world. Nobody can forget their attacking, quick-passing, total football display versus a stacked Manchester United side managed by Sir Alex Ferguson under the lights of the great Wembley Stadium in the Champions League final. The match ended 3–1 with a goal apiece from Barcelona’s starting front 3 as they were crowned champions of Europe. Experts and pundits predicted a decade of dominance from the Blaugranas with Pep Guardiola at the helm and exciting youngsters from La Masia under his wing.
Fast-forward to 2021, FC Barcelona are in a financial mess, of around 1 billion Euros, unable to register their greatest player ever and their new signings due to the extreme wage budget. Things on the pitch haven’t been great either, with humiliations vs Roma, Liverpool, Bayern and PSG in the last 4 years being the main talking points. They do have, what many fans believe to be, the perfect leader in Joan Laporta. He has to clean this financial mess and needs to make proper signings to bring the club to where it used to be. He has made a few in Aguero, Depay, Emerson and Eric Garcia. Eric Garcia seems to be the replacement for the ageing Pique. There are other options in that position in Oscar Mingueza and the very promising, Ronald Araujo.
But the glaring void is seen in the left centre-back position. Clement Lenglet has never been the same since the Bayern debacle, with his numerous mistakes leading to costly points dropped in the league and Samuel Umtiti is not even a shadow of himself after constant injuries and pretty much zero game time. I personally think that the club needs a new signing at the left CB position and must look for one in this summer itself, if possible. So, in this article, we see some of the available and affordable options in that position and hopefully, finalize one player to help Barcelona fill the void.
All the data used in this article is from the brilliant fbref.com and the videos used for eye-test is from fullmatchsports.com.
REQUIREMENTS FOR A FC BARCELONA CENTRE-BACK
1. The current manager, Ronald Koeman started out with a 4–2–3–1 upon his arrival and moved to a 3–5–2/3–1–4–2 as he gathered that his CBs were being exposed in a 4-at-the-back system with their lack of pace. His decision to switch to a back three has produced good results and Barcelona has gained a bit of stability since. So, our centre-back should be able to slot in the left of a three-at-the-back system and as the left CB in a 4-ATB, if Koeman plans to revert back to one.
2. The centre-back should have excellent ball distribution. He should be able to play the ball out from the back with minimal errors. He must be able to distribute passes from the back to the LB(Mostly Jordi Alba) and line-breaking passes to the midfielders. He should also be able to carry the ball forward with confidence and find one of the teammates when there is space ahead.
3. He should be very good under pressure and be able to get himself out of it using quick thinking and good decision-making.
4. Jordi Alba is often closer to the attackers than the defenders. So, our new CB must take the responsibility of providing cover in the left flank. Even if he lacks pace, he must be very aware positionally and thus help the team to regain possession quickly by winning the ball when the opponent decides to break and counter.
5. He must be good aerially and make sensible decisions when opponents take the long-ball approach.
6. In a 3 ATB, he will play with Eric Garcia and Ronald Araujo mostly. Garcia is a very ‘Pique’ type defender, not too quick but relies heavily on his positional awareness and a decent on-the-ball defender. Araujo is strong, aerially dominant, faster than the average centre-back but doesn’t possess the best ball playing qualities. Our CB must compliment both the CBs by providing cover for Garcia’s lack of pace and Araujo’s lack of technicality.
7. Brownie points if he has already played in a team which plays possession-based attacking football.
THE FIRST DRAFT
Our first draft of players includes left-footed CBs in top clubs from Europe’s top 5 leagues. The selected CBs play in clubs only from which Barcelona can buy, so players from direct domestic rivals and Euroepan rivals are excluded. The 5 CBs from our first draft in no particular order are :
We will now use the fbref data available to get an idea of what each player offers to their respective teams and what they can offer for FC Barcelona. All the data is from the 2020/21 league season and is adjusted to per 90 minutes. The five-man draft will be deduced to a final shortlist of three for eye-test.
DATA ANALYSIS
Defensive Contribution : In this plot, we measure the defensive capabilities of the CBs using their Tackles+Interceptions numbers and Successful pressures that helped their team win the ball back. From the possession-adjusted data, we can clearly see how Bastoni leads his peers in both metrics. Botman is not far either. Pau Torres fails to impress here.
Discipline : Unsuccessful tackles or pressures might lead to fouls and bookings and this plot gives an idea of how clean/dirty the CBs are. Botman is the cleanest of them all, even though he had higher tackling and pressure numbers. Laporte obviously has higher numbers considering him playing in a team that dominates possession almost every game.
Passing : A very important attribute for a FC Barcelona centreback. Laporte excels in both progressive and final third passes while Botman, Pau and Bastoni have good numbers too. Romagnoli doesn’t make a case for him here.
Carries : While Bastoni leads in final third carries, Laporte once again exhibits his brilliant on-ball ability by completing around 10 progressive carries p90. Romagnoli does not possess the same on-ball characteristics as the others.
Aerial Prowess : Something that is a must for a Barca CB is good aerial ability. Teams tend to exploit the high defensive line of Barcelona and the CBs have to be aware of balls over the top to the forward or in the wings. Laporte once again leads the pack with Romagnoli second and Botman a close third.
From the above metrics, there are three standouts.
Alessandro BastoniAymeric LaporteSven Botman
With eye-test by watching previous matches, the strengths and weaknesses in each of the three players’ game are noted. There are few other factors in each player which are also taken into consideration. They will be explained below. Now, let us take a look at each player.
ALESSANDRO BASTONI
Pros : Bastoni is widely regarded as the future of Italian defence. At such a young age of 22, Bastoni has already established him as an undisputed starter at Inter. He has already played in a 3 ATB under his club manager Antonio Conte. Bastoni is skilled in switching the play to the right wingback with quick and accurate switch passes. He also often finds Lukaku by threading a ball over the top in/around the left half space behind the defensive line. This can be mirrored here, by using Fati/Depay as the receiver. This could benefit Barcelona when they are trying to find a way through low-block teams. He is also a very confident ball carrier and has the ability to find a progressive/key pass following that carry. He is quick enough to recover when he loses possession.
Cons : Bastoni doesn’t have any obvious weaknesses in his personal game. There are some other factors, though. His defensive partners at Inter have been two experienced CBs in Milan Skriniar and Stefan De Vrij. While Barca needs some experience to settle their defence for their pursuit of the league and the Champions League, signing Bastoni means he becomes one of the many young defenders Barca have. It is also a huge gamble to bring him from Serie A to La Liga for such a huge price (60M Euros according to transfermarkt.com, might even be more), which makes him the most expensive defender in La Liga history. A question remains on would he justify the price tag. Barca cannot afford another failed transfer, if Bastoni does fail.
Verdict : Bastoni is an excellent defender and a fantastic investment for the future. He possesses all qualities to become a Barcelona defender but in the current financial situation, he is an expensive, ambitious and risky option who Barca might have to stay away from, for now.
AYMERIC LAPORTE
Pros : Laporte has lost his place to Ruben Dias in the city defence. He is such a quality defender to not be playing regularly. Laporte had a brilliant Euro 2020 partnered with either Garcia or Pau Torres. He has the knack of finding line-breaking passes and is a supreme carrier of the ball, one of the best in the business. He has brilliant positional awareness and commits minimal errors while playing out from the back. He has played in a 3 ATB in City in a few instances. He also plays under Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique who share the similar philosophy as Barca. He is cheaper(45M Euros according to transfermarkt.com) and has better experience in big stages. There are various news outlets suggesting that he wants out because of his lack of game time.
Cons : Laporte’s only weakness might be his lack of pace. Also, Manchester City might not sell another CB as that would leave them with only three natural centre-backs(Dias, Stones, Ake). They might demand huge money. Barca may have to sell two or more players to meet City’s asking price.
Verdict : Laporte is a low-risk high quality CB, who fits in Barca’s defence like a glove but there are a few complications financially, which should be solved for this transfer to go through.
SVEN BOTMAN
Pros : Fresh from winning Ligue 1 with Lille, Botman is one of the most sort out CBs at the moment. He is 195 cm tall, strong and physically imposing which is very similar to Ronald Araujo. But, he differs from Araujo in the fact that he has brilliant on-the-ball quality. He often finds the LW/LB with a through ball behind the lines that puts them in space to run into. He is also brilliant in 1v1 situations and makes calculated tackles. Due to his height and huge physique, he can be a much needed set-piece threat. He is the least expensive of the three options(28M Euros according to transfermarkt.com).
Cons : Just 21 years old, Barcelona cannot expect any kind of experience from the dutchman. He is not a natural ball carrier like Laporte and is not upto the mark in his aerial distribution. He also struggles a bit when put under pressure and makes some hasty decisions. He has often played in a 4 ATB system, but has never been tested in a 3 ATB system.
Verdict : Though less expensive, Botman has had only one season in the Ligue 1 and it would be a huge gamble if Barcelona decide to keep faith on him, which I think is not the best thing to do.
CONCLUSION
Laporte definitely edges both of them with his experience. Even though his price is a problem, his recent success in the Euros and him sharing the same dressing room with Alba, Busquets, Pedri and Garcia means he would be the most fitting of all the options. 45M is a monstrous price in these circumstances but he has already proven his quality in the PL after arriving at Manchester City with a similar price tag. FC Barcelona receives a centre-back who fits their playstyle and more importantly, brings much needed experience and quality. Come on Mr. Laporta, import Laporte to the Nou Camp !

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

I was in Barcelona for an event last week. Also, it’s the first time in Barcelona for me. I know that the city is one of the best as the “city design” in the world. But I saw it with a different eye. Can it be also the best city as we think in user experience?
First of all, I loved the city. In Europe, there is just Portugal I haven’t visited yet and the only city/country that I want to live in is Rotterdam. It is a “lively” city that has lots of foreigners and everyone knows English (so I don’t need to learn Dutch that I already learned!). Also, there are lots of “expats” so you feel comfortable as a foreign. And, of course, Berlin is the city that I want to go to again and again :). After all, Barcelona is the second city I want to go to again and maybe to live there!
I loved the city not because everyone knew English and I felt comfortable about everything (to be honest, just a few people know English, we had such hard times to communicate). I loved the city because both the city and the people make you feel comfortable about living in the environment.
As I said, I saw just a few people who know English very well, and again just a few who know English “a little” to communicate. But after all, even if they didn’t understand what I was asking, they got the “situation” and tried to help me. In Turkey, we sometimes have fun with these “a little English” people who try to explain the route you’ve asked with “Go go go, left, go go, right, go, there”. And I also saw them in Barcelona! After all, I handle everything with them. So, even if you don't know English, you can communicate with them, just show what you want.
Like they don’t speak that much English, they also don’t use English signs. That is also because they use Catalan as their first language and Spanish is the second, so mostly there is no space for an English word. But you can use the city without a foreign language because of their signs! In the metro, you mostly can’t see an English word but with their sign language, you can go wherever you want. For example in Turkey, at the stations we both use Turkish and English announcements and signs. But if you also don’t know English, you will have a hard time. But in Barcelona, they use the line numbers, the line flow, and some good signs to show where to go and where to wait.
I also see those signs at the airport. For example, if you need to do something about tax-free, you need to go to Terminal 1. But our flight was from Terminal 2 and we just looked at that sign and realized we needed to go that way to find our “shuttle”. Also, they put the same sign at the door that we need to go through.
I need to mention another thing if we are talking about the city's accessibility. I saw so many people with wheelchairs and with a walking stick because they couldn’t see. Those people were all alone, there was no one to help them with the lights, sidewalk, or getting in a store. They can do all of these by themselves.
I try to create websites that everyone can “access”, everyone can use it smoothly and feel comfortable as they do these. From now on, I want to make websites like Barcelona! And hope to see it again :).

Collection of reflections and experiences aimed at reimagining our society from an economic, social and environmental point of view

I have been to Barcelona several times, but since the last time it had been 10 years now.
A period in which the city experienced great transformations, socially and aesthetically speaking, related to urban regeneration. Fruit of the work of one mayor in particular, Ada Colau, a “grassroots” activist who brought a breath of new air to the city, and of many other figures who believed in positive change for local communities.
For work reasons, I was in Barcelona for a couple of days, and I took the opportunity for a “regeneration tour” in 24 hours, to understand what has changed in the city and what has unfortunately or fortunately remained the same over time.
I walk out of the hotel in Poblenou where I was staying and already I feel happy. In front of me trees and bushes hide the concrete. No horns or engine noise nearby, just the sound of Barcelona’s typical green parrots. The impact that noise pollution has on us becomes much clearer in these moments, yet we struggle to notice it in our daily lives. I keep walking, imagining what the city would be like if it were full of spaces like this, and what all cities would be like if the gray palette of urbanism…

Earlier this month, one of the main football agreements in recent decades was made official. Leading brands in their fields of activity, Barcelona and Spotify closed a medium/long-term partnership, which promises to take the relationship between sport and entertainment to another level.To understand this business in greater depth, we first need to understand what led each of us to get here.
Spotify is a music streaming company, founded in 2006 in Sweden. At the time, people basically had two options for listening to their favorite songs digitally: paying for each one (iTunes model), or pirating with platforms like Napster.
The company, which was only officially launched two years later, emerged as a viable option between these two options, with a business model based on offering a “freemium” service (see below), and thus gained a very popular user base. large, obviously much more because of the “free” part than the “premium” part.
In the same year of release (2008) Spotify sold around 19% of its stakes to major record labels (Sony, Universal, Warner and EMI) as licensing agreements for their music. Ten years later, it went public on the New York Stock Exchange, valued at US$ 26.5 billion, and months later saw the record companies sell their shares, with the exception of Sony, which still kept half of it, and Universal, which still holds the same stake (today both have, together, something around 6% to 7% of the Swedish company). Read more about Spotify’s ownership structure here.
At the end of the same year, it launched its services in countries in the Middle East and North Africa and in 2019, two important news came: for the first time, the company was profitable, and it announced a change in strategy and positioning.
From then on, it would become a company focused on audio, rather than just music. From there, we saw a series of actions by Spotify in an attempt to expand its operations via the podcast market, buying from two start-ups in the sector, Gimlet Media and Anchor.
In 2020, it acquired exclusivity via licensing agreement for the most famous podcast on the platform, the controversial The Joe Rogan Experience (video below), for US$ 100 million (which was later reported to have been for double the value), in addition to signing partnerships with influencer Kim Kardashian, and with DC Comics. Investment in the audio sector lasts until today, and even expands into the audiobook business.
This diversification/expansion of operations makes even more sense when we understand a little more about the margin that each “product” offers Spotify.
A part of the business model, mentioned briefly at the beginning of the text, is based on a complex formula for paying royalties to record companies and artists (Read more here). Many of the singers complain that they are paid much less than they should (Spotify has gained great bargaining power), and they show great dissatisfaction. The singer Taylor Swift even removed her songs from the platform in 2014 as a form of protest.
It is stipulated, however, that 70% of the earnings that the company has with its music, is passed on to the record companies, which in turn, are responsible for paying the artists (Spotify recently even created an institutional website, Loud & Clear , with very interesting information on revenue generation and transfer of these). When someone listens to a podcast like Joe Rogan’s, the company appropriates all the money.
Today the company is the leader in its field, with 31% of the market share of the global music streaming market (graph below), according to MIDiA Research, a company that conducts research and analysis of digital markets in its survey for the second quarter. of 2021.
Despite being consolidated at the top, Spotify saw its share percentage drop compared to the same period in recent years: 33% in 2020 and 34% in 2019. At the same time, it is beginning to see the growth of Amazon Music, a service offered within from Amazon’s Video Bundle, and from YouTube Music. The study points out that the latter:
“It particularly resonates with Gen Z and younger Millennials, which should set alarm bells ringing for Spotify as its core subscriber base of 2010s Millennials in the West is starting to age.”
In 2021, Spotify implemented a price increase for several plans worldwide, including in Brazil, which may indicate, once again, an attempt to increase its margins, even with the number of users growing every quarter. Currently, according to the last report published, Spotify has 406 million active monthly users (between free and premium accounts), with a forecast that would reach 418 million in the first quarter of this year.
Within this context, Spotify started approaching football a few years ago, starting with partnerships with clubs that now have official profiles on the platform, and making playlists created by their players available. This was the case with clubs in Brazil, such as Palmeiras, the first in the country to have a profile on the platform, São Paulo and Santos. Boca Juniors also closed with the company (video below) in 2019. All these agreements, inclusive, were between 2016 and 2019.
On the other hand, in recent years Barcelona has been in a delicate economic situation. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers got so much worse, to the point that the former CEO, Ferran Reverter, declared that if the club had been a limited company, it could have gone bankrupt in early 2021.In addition to having lower revenues (mainly related to its Stadium, photo below), Barcelona broke the record of spending in its history: €1.13 billion. €112 were invested in the development of Espai Barça (project to modernize and renovate the Camp Nou and its surroundings), in addition to other “extraordinary expenses”.
As a consequence, the Catalan club released its accounts for the 2020/21 season with a deficit of €481 million. Projected revenue for the current season, meanwhile, was approved at 765 million, up 21.2% from past earnings.
Within these contexts, Barcelona and Spotify seem to have found in each other possibilities to solve their (current and future) problems. Spotify will be Barcelona’s sponsor and the club’s official Audio Streaming partner. The agreement, valid from July this year, basically involves four fronts:
The first point refers to the sponsorship of the game uniforms of the men’s and women’s professional football teams (until 2025/26), which, according to the Mundo Deportivo portal, will be €57.5 million (R$292.5 million). Which will keep Barcelona as the third club that earns with sponsorship in their kit (graphic below). Spotify will also print the training shirts of the two teams, and of the Catalan football schools, the Barça Academy Pro, until 2024/25, for another €5 million (R$ 25.4 million).
Now, Spotify takes over as the club’s sole football sponsor, replacing three other companies. Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce company, paid something around €55m to €60m (this last season, the amounts dropped to between €30m and €35m due to the effects of the pandemic) to stamp the center of the shirt. of the men’s team.
Beko, the home appliance company, paid €19m to appear on the sleeves of the game’s uniform and training shirt. With the pandemic, Beko renegotiated the contract to reduce the payment to between €12 and €10 million, giving up space in the sleeves.
Stanley Black & Decker, an industrial and domestic tools company, has been the official shirt sponsor of the women’s team since 2018, and paid €3 million per season.
The agreement also involves the sponsorship of naming rights for the stadium, which will be divided into two stages: 1) while the modernization of Espai Barça lasts and 2) another long-term agreement after the completion of the renovation of Camp Nou, which will be renamed Spotify. Camp Nou (pictured below) from the middle of this year. The Swedish company will also have its brand present in other locations in the stadium.
Also according to Mundo Deportivo, this will be a €5 million deal for the first six seasons, with the possibility of renewal for another 15 years for between €15m and €20m for each of them.
The approval of the Espai Barça project took place at the end of last year, coincidence or not, two years after the Santiago Bernabéu modernization project. The works should be completed by the end of 2027, but the Camp Nou stadium is expected to be completed two years earlier, as shown in an official statement from the club. The expected expenditure is €1.5 billion.
Hoping that the alliance with Spotify will make the project “transform the facilities and surroundings of the stadium into a new world-class entertainment experience open to the city of Barcelona”, Barcelona intends to fund it with events that do not involve football matches (see chart below). In a dossier (very detailed, by the way) released by Barça, 63% of projected revenues will come from hospitality, sponsorship and naming rights, and from meetings and events.
The third part of the agreement involves advertising assets at Spotify Camp Nou and Estadio Johan Cruyff (where the women’s and men’s football teams play), on billboards, press room, mixed zone, among others.
Finally, the partnership also includes experiences and the presence of audiovisual content, hospitality packages (remember the graphic above?) and “Barça experiences”.
A deal of this magnitude represents a step forward for sportainment. This business is the biggest one involving sports and music (although we have other important ones, as shown in Jay-Z’s relationship with football). With this panorama, we can analyze even more possible advantages for each one of those involved.
Regarding branding, the first aspect that is evident is the reinforcement of the global character that the brands achieved in this co-branding, as evidenced in the official announcement:
“The collaboration with Spotify also marks the Club’s strategic objective to proactively seek partners who share the values and philosophy that define its brand and, at the same time, allow it to maintain its status as a global reference, within and off the field, in an increasingly competitive environment”
While Barcelona on its main social networks has more than 260 million followers (only on official accounts in Spanish), Spotify, as shown above, has more than 400 million active users and has been expanding its operations.
Remember the Midia Research study, which said that Spotify’s main user base in the West was “starting to age”? So let’s go to the last part of the company’s announcement:
“Barcelona have legions of young fans all over the world — in fact, the majority of Barça fans are under 30, which is an extremely important audience for Spotify. These fans also reside in some of Spotify’s fastest growing markets, including India, Latin America and Indonesia.”
Still in these numbers, what may have been the main factor of this agreement is data sharing. Both can use each other’s database to get to know the consumption habits of fans/users and improve their products and also seek cross-selling. This can happen, for example, through geo-location, as exemplified by Spotify itself:
“Spotify is working with Barça to leverage our access to elements within the stadium to promote artists and enable discovery. For example, using dynamic digital displays to showcase and geographically target artists relevant to Barça’s global TV audience. While viewers in Europe might see a message about an artist, viewers in India might get a different and locally relevant message.”
In terms of management, both would now also become an entertainment hub. Spotify has the possibility of no longer being restricted to the digital realm, but now, it can “tangibilize” its experiences in one of the main tourist cities in Europe by having the physical space of Camp Nou and its surroundings at your disposal. It is possible that we will see the Swedish company promoting launches, events or even producing shows themselves.
It is conceivable that Spotify follows the line of “original productions”, as Netflix and Amazon do, and becomes the owner (as in the case of Joe Rogan’s podcast) and content producer, which would increase its profit margin and would also be a differential in relation to its competitors.
Barcelona also benefits from this, because it will likely have secondary financial gains by taking a share in the revenues of possible future concerts organized in their stadium. Furthermore, the use of Camp Nou (pictured below) would not only be limited during the game season, but throughout the entire year, which would generate recurring revenue for a longer period of time.
This, without counting, of course, the immediate financial gain that the culés will have. Adding all the amounts together, the first years of the agreement will give the club around €67.5 million (playing and training uniform and naming rights), which represents 10.7% of its revenues from last season.
Complex and multi-factorial, the partnership between Barcelona and Spotify is very promising and, as seen here, very, very coherent.

Greetings, football enthusiasts! Today, I’m taking you on a timeless journey through one of FC Barcelona’s unforgettable nights. Join me to discover the magic that unfolded in the clash against Chelsea (2009), a night engraved in the annals of football history.
“Each second felt like an eternity”
The story begins in a hub of pure excitement. Chelsea already led 1-0, and Barça faced a mountain to climb. At that time, as a 12-year-old schoolboy, I returned from school with indescribable excitement. I couldn’t wait to see how my heroes would tackle this colossal challenge.
I remember sticking to the TV, still wearing my school uniform, eagerly anticipating the spectacle. It was more than just a match for me; it was an immersive experience, a magical interlude in my adolescence.
As the match progressed, stress mounted. Every whistle, every pause in play, everything seemed to decide Barça’s fate. My heart raced; each second felt like an eternity.
Then came the 93rd minute, a moment etched in my mind. Andrés Iniesta, the football genius, triggered an explosion of emotions. I remember leaping with joy, unable to contain the excitement. It was a moment of deliverance, where football transcended the sport to become a pure emotional experience.
Let’s be honest—beyond the scoreboard, there were refereeing decisions that could have altered the narrative. As a fan, I couldn’t help but acknowledge the whims of fate. Football, with its imperfections, added to the drama of that unforgettable night.
Ultimately, beyond the scoreboard, it was a fan’s journey—a roller coaster of emotions, from doubt to belief, from anxiety to jubilation. Join me next time to relive other unforgettable football moments.
Don’t forget to subscribe, and share your own stories in the comments. Until next time, keep the football spirit alive!
This is Stanley,

Barcelona was never on my radar as a place to visit, let alone move to. In 2024, nearly 12 million tourists visited this city, which is now my home. After four and a half years as a resident, I’ve seen its good and its bad, but moving here has still been my best big life decision, and I’ve made more than my fair share of bad ones.
Before you question, “I wonder what it’s like to be an American expat living in Barcelona,” let me make something perfectly clear. I identify as an immigrant. Expats, in my opinion, have large sums of disposable income, something I do not have.
My decision to move here had nothing to do with its beautiful architecture, fabulous food, and comfortable climate. I moved here because, while visiting Tuva, a small Siberian republic in the Russian Federation that shares a border with Mongolia, for a third time, I met a woman there who happened to live in Barcelona. What started as a friendship turned into a romance, and after several visits to see her, I took the dive into the deep end of the pool and eventually moved here permanently.
Anything worth doing usually has a few bumps in the road, and my decision to move to Barcelona was hit with a huge one. Three days before my flight from New York to Barcelona, the pandemic shut the world’s borders…

Hey readers, don't forget to watch the YouTube link of the immersive experience at the end of Camp Nou tour. It’s amazing and you’ll want to watch it over and over! https://youtu.be/n9vXBp5rQfA don't miss out sure to watch it !
As an avid traveller, I’m always searching for the heart of a city, that unique pulse that goes beyond the typical tourist trail. In Barcelona, I found it not just in the architectural wonders, but within the hallowed walls of Camp Nou.
While I didn’t get to witness the electrifying energy of a live match, the tour of FC Barcelona’s legendary stadium was an experience in itself. From the moment I approached the colossal structure, I felt the weight of football history. Camp Nou isn’t just a stadium its mesmerising almost feeling hypnotised.
Walking through the stadium, I could almost hear the echoes of roaring crowds and the legendary players who graced that pitch. The sheer scale of the place is breath taking. Standing on the side lines, imagining the thrill of a packed stadium, gave me goose bumps. Visiting the changing rooms, walking through the tunnel the players use, and seeing the press box all provided a unique perspective.
The museum offered a fascinating glimpse into the club’s rich history, showcasing trophies, iconic jerseys, and the stories behind Barcelona’s greatest moments. It’s a testament to the club’s legacy and its deep connection to the city.
Even without a match, Camp Nou vibrated with an almost palpable energy. It’s a place where passion and history collide. To top it all off, the tour concluded with a truly immersive 360-degree cinematic experience ( link at the top of this article make sure to watch it), putting me right in the heart of the action with all the legendary players. It was an incredible way to feel the pulse of the team. This entire experience gave me a deeper understanding of Barcelona, a city where football is more than just a sport; it’s an integral part of the culture.
So, if you’re visiting Barcelona, make sure to add Camp Nou to your itinerary. Whether you’re a die-hard football fan or simply curious, a tour of this iconic stadium is an unforgettable experience. It’s a chance to connect with the soul of the city and understand why football is so much more than just a game.
A trip you need to definitely add to your bucket list!

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
I am on my way to the airport as I started writing this.
A few days ago, I flew to Spain to begin the first leg of my solo trip around Europe. There’s no deeper reason why I’m taking this trip except I know that, whatever the outcome is, I need to do it and it will reveal its beautiful purpose in time.
It’s too early to write my reflections about my experience, and there is definitely so much to be written. But, I’m about to fly out of Spain today to my next destination, and I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by the kindness around me, especially that I am far from home.
From that metro guy who brought out his phone to use Google Translate so he could better give me instructions,
that other passenger who help me carry my luggage upstairs because I didn’t know you can go around and maybe find a lift,
that guy from Albania on a holiday who walked me to the bus stop ‘coz I’ve been literally going circles, looking for my ride to my hostel,
that guy from Germany, who was also on a holiday, but who explained the route of the bus I took to assure me and who also made suggestions on what touristy things I should do,
my roommates from Egypt, Brazil, and Chile who already feel like long-time friends, offering help and suggesting to meet up again in my next destinations,
Viki from Hungary, who provided me company on my first day, sharing stories as well as the same love for sports and dogs,
Mary Margaret from the US, who helped me book a tour and let me pay her in cash because my card wouldn’t work for online purchases because of its registered local number,
Miquel, a true blue Catalan from Esparreguera who adjusted his sched so I could go hiking in Montserrat — the reason why I added Barcelona to this trip,
all the fellow tourists and travelers who offered to take my photo (regardless if they turned out good shots or not) because I was alone,
the Spanish girl who lives near my hostel who taught me the best way to the airport,
David, a guy from Slovenia who works at the hostel, who gleefully (but not sure if legally) offered to keep my luggage and carry-on bag at the storage room free of charge for two days,
the ladies at the buses and the metro who weren’t articulate in English but still entertained my questions and went out of their way so we could find the lift for my heavy luggage,
the guy on the wheelchair, who was, of course, an expert to accessing the elevators, who kept on reminding me not to ride the train that runs through the same line as the train to the airport,
the Spanish girl who sat closer to my luggage at the airport terminal when I had to leave and check my flight details on the screen, and who then told me where to find assistance.
I have been just less than a week away, and I have many people to thank for — especially my family. But let me start with these strangers. I hope I got to know all their names and keep communication, but it warms my heart to think that even strangers can play magical cameos in anyone’s life.
When I arrived in Spain, I knew that getting lost should be enjoyed just as much as getting to one’s destination in a breeze. And true enough, I got lost, I doubted my direction and decisions multiple times, but I survive, learning lessons and making memories.
I am about to leave Spain, convinced that the world is beautiful. Yes, because Barcelona and Catalonia are a sight to behold. But more so, because of the kindness all around us.

When we talk about football clubs, Spanish football clubs, especially FC Barcelona, come to mind. FC Barcelona has emerged as one of the biggest and most renowned football clubs in the world. Let’s take a journey into the development of FC Barcelona and how they have continuously adapted to the demands of the times.
FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by Joan Gamper and has since become an important part of Barcelona’s culture and history. FC Barcelona shares a strong connection with Catalonia, as it has emerged as a rallying point for Catalan identity, providing a platform for the expression of Catalan aspirations. The club’s motto, “Mes que un club” (More than a club), reflects its social, cultural, and political impact. This identity has evolved over time, solidifying the club as a symbol of resistance and Catalan identity.
One of the most visible aspects of FC Barcelona is their playing style. They embrace a philosophy of beautiful football and ball dominance, known as “tiki-taka.” This style of play is a developed and perfected version of “Total Football” popularized by former Barcelona manager, Johan Cruyff. Cruyff’s influence and tactical approach laid the foundation of FC Barcelona’s philosophy.
Later, under the guidance of coaches Louis van Gaal and especially Pep Guardiola, FC Barcelona refined and implemented the tiki-taka style to its fullest potential. Guardiola played a significant role in promoting and developing “tiki-taka” during his successful tenure as Barcelona’s head coach from 2008 to 2012, collecting 14 major trophies.
The development of FC Barcelona is not limited to their playing style. They have also strengthened their youth player development structure and established the renowned football academy, La Masia. In recent years, Barcelona has also enhanced their approach to using technology and data analysis to improve team performance. They are currently renovating their stadium, now called Spotify Camp Nou.
FC Barcelona’s development is also reflected in their history of success. The club has won numerous domestic and international titles, including La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. They have had star players like Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, and many more who have become symbols of Barcelona’s dominance.
FC Barcelona has undergone a remarkable evolution over time, both in terms of playing style and as a social institution. The combination of visionary coaching, skilled players, and a commitment to the club’s philosophy led to the mastery of tiki-taka at Barcelona. They continuously adapt to the changing times and follow the path of remarkable development. FC Barcelona is not just a football club; it is a symbol of spirit, identity, and values that define them, just like their motto, “Mes Que Un Club” (More Than a Club).

TL;DR💛 ProsUpcoming tech and product communityVibrant cityEasy to live day-to-day life without learning the language
🚧 ConsSalaries lower than other European citiesLots of paperwork for visa/residency in SpanishFlat-hunt can be a challenge
If you are up for reading the long part, we have🤔 Why Barcelona💬 Interview Process📑 Spain Visa🏦 Working in N26🏠 Flat-scene & Utility Bills🥘 Food💸 Budget☎️ Language👯‍♀️ Friends and Indian Community💔 Pandemic☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona
If you followed along, I had decided quite early I wanted to rent a studio apartment in Paris and live there as an adult. After graduation, and while working in Bangalore, I was looking for reasons to travel or move abroad as my weekend side project.
With my experience and profile, I figured I should diversify my options. So I applied to a lot of places for jobs — Ottawa, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, New York (yes yes I know how impossible the US visa situation is!). I was pretty much open to any city for the experience!
I had applied to an N26 opening that had Berlin/Barcelona/Vienna mentioned. During one of the interviews, the recruiter mentioned I was being considered for the Barcelona office.
Recruiter: “So what do you think Chhavi?”
The open-source community I contributed to back in college, had roots in Barcelona. I had visited Barcelona before twice and had absolutely loved it. I had tagged it as “my city” pretty much on the first visit. I was always super grateful to be in Barcelona, but never thought I could ever live there. It just never crossed my mind.🙃
The recruiter stared back at me through the zoom call.
Me: “I love Barcelona!”
A friend of a friend used N26, and he mentioned it to me. Mobile banks were still a new concept to me, so I did a little bit of research. A quick Google search listed all of these fin-tech darlings — Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26.
I found a mutual on LinkedIn and requested a referral. I saw on LinkedIn that they had a few folks from India, so I thought maybe…maybe they do sponsor visas. Long haul, but worth a shot. I waited for a bit and heard back from a recruiter 2–3 weeks later.
I was super excited to make it to the interviews. The “funnel” is so dramatic when you apply abroad — that this feels like an achievement. First I ordered and ate a lot of ice cream through Swiggy. Then I spent a lot of time preparing. More on this in part 1.
chhavii.medium.com
1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.2. Design Exercise. I was asked to design a mobile application for reading curated books.3. Video-call to discuss the Design Exercise. My first chance to interacting with product designers on the team. We talked about the exercise, about the team, and in general how I could contribute.4.Video-call with a Product Manager and a Product Designer. Here we talked more about product thinking, our take on MVPs, using data, making trade-offs, and working as a cross-functional team. 5. Video-call with Head of Design. We talked about my career aspirations, how they see the team growing, how I could contribute, and on giving back to the design community and making the product more inclusive.
1. N26 was looking for someone with my level of experience. Most of the times it’s not you. It’s just about what the team needs right now.
2. N26 was building a truly international company, hence was open to sponsoring visas.
3. The extra effort I had put to balance out my years of experience — I had prepared an analysis of the N26 app, and the ways I could contribute to the team.
The whole process felt pretty organic and I think took around a month. The part that was the biggest selling point for me was the people I talked with. I found all of them super respectful, and great listeners. We talked a lot about how they see the team growing, and how I could add to it. In hindsight, these conversations were such a strong indicator of why the team would be perfect for what I was looking for!
My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!
It wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.
My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.
N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.
The process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.
I had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.
Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!
Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️
On workWe worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.
It was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.
I also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.
The office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!
On design teamWe call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.
We had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.
Honestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.
Side note: I will share some more pictures on my Instagram stories here.
This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃
You cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.
Barcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.
My first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).
I had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.
I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩
At one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳
We could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.
It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀
Again, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the Menu del Dia — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!
I also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s ras malai.
It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂
A rough breakdown of my monthly budgetRent — 650 EurosUtility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)Groceries — 200ishTransport — 50ishTravel (pre-covid) — 400ish
Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!
I took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.
Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.
I had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)
I am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!
It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.
I remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.
I was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.
I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.
Even though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.
I sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.
I would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!

A personal reflection on the unexpected, hours-long power outage that left Spain and parts of two other countries in the dark.
It’s been four days since the blackout. Though I took plenty of notes on the day itself, it wasn’t until I read someone else’s reflection that I felt moved to write my own.
It all began around 10:30 a.m. I’d just finished a call with two teammates, where we broke down a large epic into smaller user stories for the next day’s refinement session. That meeting had been one of my main focuses — finalizing those stories would free up my time later in the week while the development team started the development of those tasks.
The night before, a quiet Sunday, I’d gone to bed early. Lying there, I mentally outlined my week. Writing those stories was at the top of my Monday to-do list. So, after the meeting, I grabbed my draft notes and a glass of water, ready for a deep-focus session. But Jira wasn’t updating. My Wi-Fi had disconnected. Odd, but not entirely unusual, as my home connection can be temperamental.
I went to the kitchen. The room felt strangely dark, so I reached for the light switch. Nothing. That’s when I realised the electricity was out.
Our neighbour has been doing construction work for months, so my first assumption was that they’d accidentally cut a line. I stepped outside and asked,“Excuse me, I noticed I have no electricity. Are you working on anything that might’ve caused it?”“It’s not just you,” he said. “The whole street’s out.”
Strange. A few months back, a nearby building caught fire, and we briefly lost power, but this felt different. I still had mobile data, so I messaged my team to let them know I was offline trying to figure it out what was going home with power at home. One colleague replied, saying he’d also lost power, and he lives far from me. I wrote back:“Hey, is this happening across Barcelona?”He responded: “I have friends in Badalona and Madrid going through the same.”
Just then, my partner arrived from the gym. Before I could say anything, he told me he’d stopped by the supermarket but couldn’t buy anything, no electricity, no card payments.
My thoughts began racing. Was this just local? A regional outage? I checked the news: barely two or three headlines. No one knew the cause yet.
I decided to stay calm and wait for a few more minutes. I was constantly checking the WiFi to see if there were any chances of it being back yet.
I tried calling a friend. The connection was poor, but her voice crackled through:“It’s horrible, isn’t it? I can’t hear you well.” She mentioned GPS was still working, so she was heading home, adjusting to her new commute after recently moving.
She was okay but had to hang up, her husband was calling from Vilanova i la Geltrú. That made me pause. A colleague had mentioned Madrid, but the news hadn’t confirmed anything. If her husband in Vilanova was calling about the blackout, this wouldn’t normalise in only a few minutes, it was spreading. Or already had.
I checked in with my partner. He seemed calm, which made me second-guess my own growing anxiety. I appreciated his steadiness, but the total lack of urgency worried me too. He began messaging friends using mobile data. Some confirmed that France wasn’t affected, but Sitges was also out. Could this be a cyberattack?
By now, I’d lost mobile signal entirely.
I opened the fridge: bare. We had enough leftover for maybe a day. Living in the city center, we usually buy fresh groceries daily. No need to stockpile.
My partner saw the look on my face and began filling some water bottles. I checked our cupboards: some rice, a bit of pasta, not much more than that. Thankfully, we had a gas cooktop. I rummaged for cash: around €20 in a jar of travel coins, another €30 in my wallet. That would have to do.
But what to buy? Some food for today and tomorrow, of course, but besides that? What was I preparing for?
A few weeks ago, I’d bought a pack of 100 candles for my night routines, reading and journaling by candlelight. At least we were set for lighting. I praised myself for that. We debated how to get updates. Would a radio be too much? Were we overreacting?
I reminded myself this wasn’t local. Multiple cities were affected. We decided to go out and see how the neighbourhood was coping.
Around 1:20 PM. We took the stairs, five flights down, in pitch black. No emergency lights. I won’t lie, that terrified me. I regretted not calling my family in Brazil before losing signal.
Outside, neighbours were talking, but no one had answers. We walked around the neighbourhood. Major supermarkets like Ametller and Caprabo were closed. Corner stores were open, with lines forming outside. People were buying toilet paper, water, radios and candles.
2:30 PM. At one building entrance, a doorman said their power was back. Ours still wasn’t. Why would some buildings have power while others didn’t? I assumed hospitals had generators, but what about regular residential buildings?
Being outside helped. I felt calmer even though the streets were not still. Public transport had stopped: the train, tram, and metro. Only buses were still running, and that’s why the lines were getting stupidly longer. People looked stressed, overchecking their phones, but frustrated with the lack of signal.
From another perspective, there were still some people sunbathing, while others drank beer on terraces. Some kind of Woodstock in the middle of an apocalypse?
We skipped the long queues and wandered further until we found a small store with no line. We bought canned beans and pasta, enough for today and tomorrow.
At the entrance, a woman was controlling how many people entered. Inside, it was dark. They were using flashlights and calculators, only accepting cash. It felt surreal.
Around 3:00 PM. We noticed a few places still had power, including a small café near Sagrada Familia, and the hospital of course. But most of the city was still out. The ATMS in our way were offline. There was a single one close to a hospital that had a huge line; we considered entering it, but decided not to; we still had a small amount of money after the groceries.
Back home, we climbed the stairs again. We had food. Water. Candles. We decided not to buy the radio, and only wait until later that night or even tomorrow. There wasn’t much more we could do.
I lay on the sofa and finally finished a book I’d started a month ago. My partner opened an old box he hadn’t touched in a year and started organising it.
Later, we talked. Made theories. What would we do in another lockdown? Would we stay in the city or move to the countryside? Buy a car? Rent first? For how long? Just possibilities. Playing out with that amount of extra time we suddenly gained for our Monday, together, in the quiet.
We cooked. We ate. It was still early.
The power had gone out at 10:30 a.m. It wouldn’t come back until nightfall. At 9:30 p.m I was in bed, calming down the nerves of that day and expecting that life would be back to normal in the morning.
I woke up at night, not exactly at what time, and noticed one light from the living was on. I didn’t do the effort to go and turn it off. Somehow it helped me to feel safe.
That day reminded me how little we control, and how much we take for granted. The ability to cook. To call loved ones. To pay for food. To know what’s happening in the world. It was all suspended.
It’s been four days since the episode. There is still no conclusions on what might have caused the European Blackout.
In the stillness of the power outage, something became clear: maybe we do need to prepare ourselves better for unknowns, not with panic, but with presence, healthy discussions, and perspective. Some things are really just out of our control. Important time to think on how we’ve been connected – or not – to the world around us.
In any case, I always knew those 100 candles would come in handy.
If you found this story meaningful or have questions about what happened that day, I’d love to hear from you. Drop a comment — I’m happy to share more.

Barcelona 2023/24— The end to Xavi’s successful but complicated stint.,https://medium.com/@Am10talk/barcelona-2023-24-the-distasteful-end-to-xavis-successful-era-48e41063687e,"Sign up

On November 6th 2021, Xavi Hernández Creus, one of Barcelona’s biggest legends and best midfielders ever, was appointed as the manager of FC Barcelona following the sacking of previous manager and club legend, Ronald Koeman — after a run of poor results, caused by the lack of identity and dynamism in football, that led to Barcelona being 9th on the La-Liga table when he was relieved of his said duties.
Xavi took the same team, with a couple of reinforcements in the following January transfer window of 2022, took the same team to 2nd place with an impressive period — playing some fluid and entertaining football, and also beating Real Madrid 4–0 in the process, ensuring the first El Clasico win since Ernesto Valverde’s departure.
The football witnessed initially under Xavi seemed very refreshing to a fanbase that had witnessed consistently underwhelming seasons of football prior to this — which prompted hyperbolic conversations regarding him being the ‘2nd coming of Pep Guardiola’.
He instilled an identity — provided a tactical foundation to a squad that lacked it very much; he deployed a 4–3–3, a more direct version than the conventional Barcelona style, but an entertaining and fluid style due to how the players inter-connected and understood their environment, which declined overtime due to the departures of some of the key ‘connectors’.
The following season (2022/23) — Barcelona proceeded to win La-Liga and the Spanish Super Cup very convincingly. Barcelona opted to play the box-midfield (midfield of 4) gradually as the season passed by, which helped neuter some of Barcelona’s core issues in the league, but were again exposed in some of the European nights (like Manchester United, Inter Milan).
Although Barcelona suffered a UCL group stage exit that season, the feelings around Xavi’s future / tenure were very positive, especially going into next season. Most seemed convinced that he was Barcelona’s man long-term. But, things went downhill this season with Barcelona’s levels of performance completely regressing while also going trophy-less, overall.
“Signing Xavi Is The Best Decision I’ve Ever Made Since I Became President”
These were the words of Joan Laporta, the Club President in April 2022, and in over 2 years — On 24th May, FC Barcelona announced that Xavi’s last game in charge as manager will be against Sevilla (the last game of the season) and he will not be continuing next season. There’s been such a drastic change in the perception of him as a manager over a year, something must’ve changed, and something did change.
Barcelona’s feelings coming into this season were relatively positive; the aim for this season was clear — an establishment of threat in Europe while maintaining the impressive domestic success we possessed, but did no one see coming this level of regression with regards to our overall style of play, rather than just losing out on trophies due to marginal differences.
Barcelona’s board parted ways with the previous sporting director, Jordi Cruyff (son of Johan Cruyff) and appointed Deco as the new sporting director; The club also parted ways with Mateu Alemany — which, essentially meant there was more responsibility in Yuste’s and Laporta’s hands — which was unhealthy, because neither have the credentials to be holding authority involving them to make sporting decisions.
Now, certain issues seemed to come with the power gradient — there was a lack of respect / consideration with respect to the manager’s decisions / preferences when it came to certain decisions that’d affect the manager the most, like the Vitor Roque situation. No board should sign a player with a manager you’re aiming to keep when he’s insisting against a particular signing, because it becomes unhealthy within the board & for the player’s future, as well.
A few issues became seemingly clear, and primarily, it was the unwarranted amount of influence Jorge Mendes (the agent) possessed on Barcelona’s footballing operations, when in reality — he has no authority to have such grave involvement, and it brings in an inherent level of bias in transfer operations, that could result in Barcelona settling for players with Mendes as agent, despite them being suboptimal for Barcelona’s squad, like the pressure make the Cancelo / Felix deals permanent, the heavy links with Ruben Neves last season etc.
So, in reality, there has always been suboptimal conditions in terms of board structuring and planning that can make it infeasible for managers to succeed at this club, and it was made much worse with the departures of Jordi Cruyff and especially, Mateu Alemany.
The handling of certain situations — including Xavi’s sacking has been extremely poor from the board. Poor treatment of personnel who genuinely commit their all towards the betterment of the club is an attitude that cannot last long at a club such as this, and will / can ultimately lead to the downfall of this particular mandate.
This was a ‘decent’ transfer window considering the financial limitations and there was a good initiative to complete sales of players that weren’t exactly contributing to the club in anyway, anymore. Oriol Romeu seemed like a very good signing at first, but it didn’t go as planned as the season went on due to confidence issues and also primarily — systematic issues that aggregated his flaws and didn’t provide him suitable conditions to succeed.
Felix and Cancelo seemed to be decent reinforcements due to their high technical potential and talent. The issue came with Cancelo’s and Felix’s mental profiles — often ignorant, unwarrantedly complex, reckless, more flair, less effectiveness, which, as expected, led to improper application of their high technical qualities and inconsistent showings in possession, combined with poor showings in general out of possession;
Regardless, Ilkay Gundogan, hands down, proved to be Barcelona’s best signing for this season by a mile. A footballer of the highest level — mentally, physically and technically. He is a true Swiss-Army Knife in every sense of the word due to how versatile, resilient and intelligent he is.
Transfers regarding personnel has been decent at best, but the overall squad planning and direction regarding overall club’s structure has been unconvincing and seems very unsustainable due to the lack of rational basis behind most decisions this particular dispensation has made. Far too ‘individualistic’ and preference-based without looking at the overall larger picture.
Despite current transfer planning / direction being slightly off, the investment in youth for the B team has been pretty impressive, especially under Deco, with signings like Noah Darvich, Ibrahim Diarra and Mikayil Faye. Although, there’s no balance with respect to elevating the 1st team while doing it sustainably on a financial level — hence, the lack of direction and planning I stated.
It’s been a disappointing season overall, from Barcelona, in the tactical domain, on both offensive and defensive fronts. As shown in a graph created by “Markstats” on X :
Barcelona’s deep entries in the opposition graph has massively declined while the opposition deep entries increased as the season progressed. Although, it is very important to note that most teams don’t look to threaten Barcelona through consistent entries / pressure in their box, rather — they use transitions / counter-attacks to try and exploit / attack Barcelona’s defense. But, Barcelona, being a dominant team in possession, in La-Liga, not being able to create enough deep entries, and it going to an extent that it’s not too dissimilar as opposition deep entries suggests poor effectiveness in and, also out of possession.
Barcelona’s issues this season showcase the fact that Xavi is an inexperienced coach with ideas that need proper maturing, multi-dimensionality and clarity in implication. It could, either, be an issue regarding a lack of transcendence of the ideas clearly or a lack of applying these ideas properly, or both — either way, both are co-related mechanisms. Let’s get into some detail.
Barcelona didn’t change much, in terms of their structural base or their formation in terms of positioning. There was a continuation on the 4–3–3 with often one forming a double pivot in build-up, as done last season, except it became more rigid, and horizontal relative to its surroundings. The reasoning is definitely due to Busquets’ departure — which essentially meant that Barcelona needed more dynamism / technical prowess in build-up, without a Busquets.
The replacement came in the form of Romeu, and the build-up responsibility gradually shifted more to Frenkie De Jong with Romeu assisting in build-up. Barcelona seemed ineffective on a consistent basis when it came to enabling effective progression when playing against opposition presses and already seemed to hit some road-blocks regarding fluidity last season, especially in terms of de-compacting opposition defenses (like Inter) but, this season, it got much, much worse.
What seemed to be the issue was — Barcelona had a structural idea in mind, but were incompetent in executing or even understanding how to utilize / implicate the structure to progress efficiently. Barcelona were too rigid / unpredictable, because of an obvious lack in fluidity.
This came due to one major factor, and that’s the DISTANCING. The distances between players became much larger to try and gain positional / numerical advantages, but it came at a cost of compromising for compactness and fluidity.
There was often the lack of an extra receiver between the lines, and instead there was an increased emphasis on playing extremely direct passes which came with the intent of exploiting space that exists, not creating or controlling. This can also be validated by how often Barcelona have to go long to feed runners, or put it on top of defenses to feed runners that does not sustain because it is a high ‘variance’ style and also, an easily readable and predictable style.
It also clearly explains how Pau Cubarsi’s inclusion has made Barcelona much more efficient on the ball — due to his immaculate tactical awareness and manipulation using his body language and footwork which results in creation of gaps / openings of lanes through which Barcelona can find a player better, like how Cubarsi often opens up the middle of the pitch to find Lewandowski directly.
Players do not move in closer proximities to combine, create space and release to the runners. Rather, Barcelona try to do the latter before-hand which is ineffective due to the opposition still maintaining numbers at the back, and the lack of proximity which can undermine the level of reception, and provide a higher risk to the pass.
This showcased the fact that this team had not culminated a set of consistent principles / a basis of automation in possession that would help them play through the opposition and utilize the potential of their structural knowledge into something much more useful and effective.
A conundrum that Barcelona often found themselves is that they were not given the clarity on when to keep the ball, how to keep the ball, and why to keep the ball. What leads to players playing extremely direct passes, and often turning games into chaos is a clear lack of clarity with regards to collective intent, and how to approach the game. That, combined with the larger distances between players, leads to what we call as — over-verticality.
Barcelona have become increasingly rigid in its style of play — a great example being, how often players out wide are completely isolated and have no pathway but to complete their take on, or lose the ball and concede a turnover — which made Balde an easy target to retrieve possession off if Barcelona ever went out wide to him, because he’s not a 1v1 monster; rather, he’s someone that would thrive on more rotations when wide, and more license to carry in the middle — that’s been clearly failed to be addressed due to the high and wide policy of our full-backs in build-up and attacking phases.
The rigidity and lack of fluidity transcends onto why the particular idea of Xavi’s Barcelona are so reliant / obsessed on / with 1v1 dribblers (Yamal / Dembele), and that’s primarily because that’s Barcelona’s only pathway (often) to creating space or progressing out wide due to the lack of rotations, when the whole idea of exploiting said ‘openings’ leads to not much good in the era of modern football due to the increasing amounts of compact defenses — opposition teams are constricting space very well and as often as possible.
There aren’t enough rotations, whether it is deep with the full-backs and midfielders, or whether it’s ahead with the wingers and full-backs. The rigidity prompts individual prowess and spontaneous solution-finding that leads to unreliability / inconsistencies in possession and often a chaotic style against better teams — because the players are playing at their own rhythm, understanding and intent, due to the lack of a collective idea of execution — which shows the lack of a principle base.
The lack of movement has caused Barcelona to become a static and predictable side, lacking basic combinations in possession due to rigid occupation of zones, rather than arrival and exchange of zones between players, often leading to predictable and pointless sideways circulation / forced passes forward to win 2nd balls or over the top of the last line.
The reason Barcelona look much more fluid with Pedri and looked more fluid with Busquets because these two players had a clearer picture of how to progress and play as a collective with the ball — they tried to receive and create shorter distances, dictate movements on the pitch and tried to retain possession when possible, as well.
Their INTENT was / is to extert control on the pitch, which is something Barcelona have massively lacked this season. There’s no quest for territory — that has led to the patchy form this season. Lack of territorial control leads to a game-model with high variance, which is basically, you don’t control enough possibilities to narrow games down to your favour and leave it out more in the open.
This can be validated by some of Barcelona’s poor field tilt statistics against competent opposition :
— Against Athletic Bilbao on March 4th (36.4%) — Against Real Madrid (30.1%) — Against PSG 1st leg (30.0%)
Barcelona play into chaos too much — there is such lack of re-organization for the team to even play in settled possession and when they do, these are the conundrums they face in possession. It’s very unlike a usual Barcelona team, to be honest.
To sum it up — lack of clarity, lack of emphasis on being more risk-averse, controlling and sustaining attacks / pressure has led to an incredibly patchy season, showcasing clear deficiencies with our play-style, despite Barcelona having the personnel to deploy a better style of football with more control, clarity and fluidity.
Barcelona have been very inefficient out-of-possession, and it shows in their massive increase in xGA (Expected Goals) by almost 6 (from 29.7 to 35), from last season. A more leaky defense, something that’s not anticipated from the team who was the best defensive team (on output) in La-Liga last season.
Barcelona’s press has been very lackluster against teams good on the ball. Teams like Girona and Real Madrid have been able to consistently play out of it with ease, and it goes beyond the personnel at the manager’s disposal.
Barcelona do press with a 4–4–2 structure, with often the advanced #8 and Lewandowski leading the front 2. Lewandowski, usually, aims to angle the opposition into playing out towards one flank, but the opposition can often find the free man pretty comfortably against the press, because the center is not compact, at all.
There’s a spacing issue with Barcelona — often, Barcelona find themselves so far apart from each other, that they cannot compact / constrict enough space to restrict their opponents. This is caused due to the extremely rigid man-to-man nature of the press. The players seem to be glued to one player of the opposition team irrespective of rotations / dropping deep that drives Barcelona’s key players out of position and also help teams find the free man with ease using overloads from deep.
(Source : @CaptnGuardiola from X)
This scatters the whole team — which leads to poor spacing and larger distances between each other. This level of complacency and rigidity in a team’s out of possession leads to a very exploitable approach — especially because Barcelona don’t have the highest intensity / dueling capacity, as well.
The last line of defense is also much deeper (out of cautiousness) which means the last line is looking to concede pressure / absorb pressure more than looking to close down / prevent the opposition’s by-passing to further continue until Barcelona’s box — which is one of the main causes of the uneven spacing. There’s also a clear lack of co-ordination on timing / jumps and collective movement when the press is initiated.
It seems very individualistic, with a lack of coherence and each individual with a different intent / approach to the press and that’s the sign of a lack of collective principles instilled; It’s clear that, this is more than just a personnel issue, and there’s an issue with Barcelona’s intent in covering space / the ball, that goes beyond the press.
A team’s ability to adapt to different game-states also depends upon how well-drilled and compact their blocks are. The low / mid blocks have been suboptimal from Barcelona — which, after the PSG games, many would consider a fair assertion.
Multiple games are evidence to this; the distancing between the lines has allowed too much central access to opposing teams BTL. The block tends to be too passive, allowing enough leverage around the box and solely relying on box defending, blocks and clearances.
The shifting leaves many gaps due to the larger distances between players and lack of coherence in intent. The intent in defending as an overall unit seems inherently flawed — too much of being ball-oriented and unnecessarily passive, rather than coverage of space, and compacting of space.
These are the major causes behind Barcelona’s inflation in xGA numbers and also general leakiness and lack of compactness in defense — defensive record being very poor compared to last year.
To sum it up — Barcelona have principle issues with how the football has been played, and that’s because the key enforcers on the pitch have left and we’ve been unable to put the structure to top use with coaching. Spontaneous dictators of play and solution finders like Busquets (mainly), Alba, Dani Alves and Dembele (1v1 prowess) leaving has caused a degradation in style of play due to Barcelona’s style of play, and effectiveness in style of play.
The core issue requires a manager change, unfortunately and that’s because the manager seems to be slightly inexperienced and his ideas on how to execute needs more maturation and learning — which is normal, but it also showcases that Xavi has a high potential if he can reflect on his mistakes, and what he needs to do to coach teams as a collective, better, without enforcers like Busquets.
Despite all the tactical shortcomings, Xavi has shown he is an excellent man-manager and can manage players very well by instilling a level of confidence and trust in them. He’s more than capable of pleasing a dressing room and motivating them, as a coach, and that’s an impressive quality to possess.
Barcelona have appointed Hansi Flick as the new manager, which is a slight philosophical change, but an ambitious and bold one — which only time will tell, if it pays off.
Thank you for reading; if you liked it, I would appreciate as many claps/likes, shares and comments as possible.
Much love, AM.

I recently went on what should’ve been the trip of a lifetime to Barcelona (Spain) and cities Bari, Noci, Aversa, Florence, Caserta, and Naples in Italy.
Like many trips, it was full of mishaps, twists, and surprises. But I ended up learning a lot about many things, myself included, and walked away with valuable lessons and a deeper understanding of what truly matters when exploring the world and reflecting on my own life.
And don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise.
I had initially planned to visit Rome and Pompeii in Italy, but due to time constraints, my friend and I decided to explore nearby cities instead, including Caserta. We toured the Royal Palace of Caserta before catching a train to Florence. We also ventured into lesser-known cities like Bari and Noci and had the chance to experience the vibrant Carnival of Putignano during our stay.
In Barcelona, I omitted places like the Sagrada Familia from my itinerary for several reasons: I hated crowds, was terrified of being pickpocketed, and didn’t want to go just to say I went. Additionally, since it was Ramadan for us Muslims, attending Mass at the Sagrada Familia felt sacrilegious, even if it meant gaining free admission.
Instead, I immersed myself in experiences that were more meaningful to me. I spent most of my time trying out exotic fruits I couldn’t find at home, browsing local grocery stores, learning about racial demographics and local history, talking to locals in Urdu and broken Spanish, researching the Romani people (as known as Gypsies), and studying the architectural details of everyday buildings. I have a particular fixation on doors, so I snapped as many pictures of them as I could as I roamed the city.
And I was perfectly happy doing so.
This is not to say that I didn’t do touristy things. I took a paella-making class in El Raval, where I learned how to make paella, danced around the kitchen, and had enjoyable conversations with people from Moldova, Turkey, Argentina, and the US. I tried tiramisu from every cafe I could. Afterward, I oohed and aahed at paintings in the Picasso Museum, marveled at the World Culture Museum artifacts, got lost on my way to the Chocolate Museum, and pondered the different tastes of Coca-Cola in Europe and the US at a cafe. And I shopped till I dropped, with bags full of spices, magnets, postcards, keychains, and chocolates from La Rambla.
Truthfully, I did feel guilty about “wasting” my trip. The voice in my head shamed me, telling me, “What’s the point of flying all the way here if you don’t check out Park Guell and the other tourist spots?”
But I listened to my body — my anxiety — which was screaming to be heard and decided to conserve my energy for another day of exploration. Instead of pushing my feet to walk the scenic mile home at peak traffic hour, I opted for an Uber, where I enjoyed pleasant conversation with the driver and saved my aching feet from further torment.
It’s not to say I played it completely safe.
Despite being told to avoid El Raval in Barcelona, I ventured there to check out vintage clothing boutiques, satisfy my homesick cravings for Pakistani foods, and buy custard apples. On the way, I went into a Pakistani jewelry store where I bought earrings for upcoming weddings and spoke to the kind store owner in Urdu. She was more than happy to discuss her son’s engagement drama and gave me a discount and free earrings. I wandered alone in the evenings, avoiding the dark alleys and blending in with a tourist group, and enjoyed the city lights. It was a peaceful way to enjoy the city’s vibrant lights and grew my confidence in solo travel.
They say travel broadens the mind and sheds light on the true nature of friendship. During this trip, I was lucky enough to experience both.
In Naples, I reunited with my high school bestie, who went above and beyond to ensure I had the best trip possible. She planned most of our itinerary, booked us a stay at a beautiful old apartment in Noci as a surprise for me, handled our high-speed train tickets for Florence, drove me around everywhere I needed to be, and indulged my constant whims for tiramisu. When it became clear that Italian food wasn’t meant for me, we loaded up on groceries and decided to cook paella at home, where we laughed, sang, and enjoyed one another’s company as we did so.
She also offered me the best of what she had — the master bedroom in her home, her nicest jackets, and the choice of going to Rome or Florence, Bari or Materra. She didn’t want me to pay for anything, but I insisted anyway because, despite the many problems in the way I was parented, one thing I was taught was never to take advantage of anyone’s kindness.
Our parting was more bitter than sweet. Despite doing almost nothing on my travel to-do list, the permeating odor of rotting garbage on the streets, and the death-defying traffic, I had the time (and the best tiramisu) of my life in Naples, the “trash can” of Italy, and couldn’t wait to come back and explore everything else.
Fast forward to Barcelona, where nearly every interaction with my other friend was wrought with tension, resentment, and impatience.
She nitpicked everything I did and said, walked ahead without stopping to wait for me, and made it clear that she didn’t want me around. She also claimed the nice double room in our Airbnb and had me choose between two closet-sized rooms so she could use the remaining room as her closet. I put my foot down and voiced my disapproval, where she eventually relented but gave me the silent treatment for the next couple of days. Despite my initial reluctance to explore alone, I braved my fears instead of putting up with my friend’s rudeness. To socialize, I called friends and family in the US and talked to them for hours. As miserable as I felt, I was touched that many people back home were rooting for me to have a great time in Europe.
Needless to say, this “friend” and I have parted ways, and I realized how disrespected and dismissed I felt in our friendship, as well as the many insults and snide remarks I overlooked throughout our time together.
Piggybacking on my previous point, we didn’t have the nicest lodging. It was clean, in the Sant Antoni neighborhood, surrounded by many things to do. And affordable. You do pay for what you get, especially for AirBnBs.
Our AirBnB had one double room, two single rooms, and no laundry services (despite them being advertised) or microwave. Our AirBnB hosts also failed to mention that there were no elevators in the building and that the walls were very thin. The beds in our rooms were hard and we woke up with sore, stiff backs every morning. The AC unit often turned on when it wanted to and I sweated right through my bedsheets at night.
It wasn’t an entirely bad place to be. Still, I would’ve appreciated an actual dryer machine instead of relying on the unreliable solar-powered clothes dryer on the terrace. And neighbors who were less vocal in their babymaking.
In several cities across Italy and in Barcelona, I quickly became a target for street vendors who could spot me as a tourist from a mile away. At first, I indulged them, buying a few gifts for my family back home. But the problem arose when I started being followed out of shops and booths, bombarded with pleas to “buy this” and “buy that,” often accompanied by sob stories about being an immigrant in a foreign country with large families to feed.
I get it — trust me, I do. As a former people-pleaser, I understand the urge to help. Most people-pleasers are empaths who want to save the world and make life better for the less fortunate.
But let’s be clear: traveling isn’t the way to fix everything wrong with the world. Europe is full of scammers and hustlers who won’t hesitate to overcharge you for something you could easily buy for a couple of euros at the local bodega. Learn to recognize the red flags. If someone is overly pushy or offers you something “for free” on the street, respond firmly with a resounding “NO!” Don’t worry about being rude — nice people make easy targets.
If you do want to tap into your empathetic side, try supporting local small businesses rather than money-laundering souvenir shops or tourist traps. Take the time to learn about the culture around you, try exotic fruits and vegetables, and always assert your boundaries.
Travel is one of those rare situations where I genuinely appreciate my resting bitch face. If you’re a soft-spoken people-pleaser like I used to be, one of my best tips is to put on a serious resting bitch face. It may be hard if you weren’t born with one, but trust me — this facial expression helped me ward off scammers, pickpockets, and hustlers. It also made saying “no” a whole lot easier. People tend to leave you alone when they think you look like someone who won’t tolerate their bullshit.
If mastering a resting bitch face feels impossible, at least look like you know where you’re going. Project confidence. Don’t act shifty; whatever youdo, don’t pull out your GPS in the middle of a sketchy area. If you need to check your phone, step into a store and ask the shopkeeper for directions.
If you’re from a country where seasoning is a way of life, like I am, you might find most European food a bit lackluster. Your best bet is to seek out Latin American or Asian restaurants or bring your spices as you explore.
I’m a huge fan of what Americans consider Italian food. When I was in Italy, I expected the food to be mind-blowing. Instead, I was met with disappointment. I found the dishes surprisingly underseasoned, missing the bold flavors I was used to in the US. For example, the pizzas I ate felt like they were missing key ingredients — salt, dried red chili pepper, and garlic powder. The carbonara at the cute local diner was far from the creamy indulgence I knew and loved in the States. Even the curry chicken pasta tasted like it was seasoned with nothing more than a Maggi instant noodle packet. For a foodie like me, it was almost heartbreaking.
Barcelona had a much better food scene, but by then, the damage was already done.
Despite the confusion, panic, and disappointment I encountered during my trip, I still had an unforgettable time. If anything, I’d happily redo my Barcelona trip knowing what I know now. Along the way, I’ve learned to embrace spontaneity, find joy in the unexpected, and trust in the good people I know. I also learned not to question the blessings that come my way — like the $150 I saved in baggage fees thanks to the kindness of airport staff in Europe. My ability to appreciate life’s simple pleasures — like admiring doors, staircases, and the frames surrounding iconic artworks — turned out to be the perfect way to ground myself amid the chaos.

Hello my friends!
I have so many essays and journal entries from my time in Spain that I’m excited to share with you on here.
Sorry that I’ve been a bit MIA during the past few months while I’ve been traveling.
I had hoped I’d publish essays every week or so, but perhaps I needed a bit of time for my ideas to percolate a bit more fully.
I am feeling ready though, to bring you my essays and journals that I’ve been writing throughout my time here.
I’ve had so many experiences I want to share with you.
In the meantime, here are some lovely photos from the other day as I walked along the shore. ☀️🌊🤗
Update me in the comments, how was your summer?
How are you feeling?
What you have you been up to lately?
I miss you all!!
Sending love,
Alex ☀️🌊

The reputation of 42 Barcelona extends far and wide. It is well-known for its beautiful Mediterranean style, deeply rooted in a rich history and strong cultural identity. What truly sets the city apart is its unique blend of tradition and modernity. It seamlessly combines historical and artistic places with innovation centers, tech hubs, and business parks. This special mix attracts people from all over the world, not just as tourists but also as residents who are charmed by the way of life and the numerous work opportunities Barcelona has to offer.
The strong IT ecosystem of Barcelona, encompassing both big companies and startups, made it an obvious choice for 42 to establish a campus in the city. There is a plethora of opportunities, especially for training that equips students with the necessary skills for the digital labor market. Barcelona, along with Catalonia as a whole, is home to a vast network of over 18,000 digital and ICT industry companies. These companies, whether belonging to the industry 4.0 or having a strong digital component, require a substantial number of digital professionals, particularly programmers.
“Barcelona is, in fact, one of the biggest digital hubs in Europe with more than 100.000 digital jobs. From day one, we had a lot of companies knocking at our doors because of the lack of digital talent, and they were attracted to the innovative methodology of 42.”Humbert Ruiz, Director of 42 Barcelona
42 Barcelona collaborates with numerous companies, from prominent industry players to medium enterprises. These companies value the opportunity to connect with emerging talent. The campus serves as a gateway for these companies to access a pool of skilled individuals whom they might not reach otherwise. Through engaging presentations, interactive workshops, and exclusive events, 42 Barcelona actively fosters the development of a thriving digital talent community. Building this community is a source of immense pride for the staff at 42 Barcelona.
42 Barcelona is funded by Fundación Telefónica and supported by Barcelona’s town hall and the Generalitat, the government of Catalonia. Following the success of 42 Madrid, Fundación Telefónica took the initiative to establish additional campuses, aiming to make a significant impact in Spain. The four campuses across the country collaborate harmoniously to benefit the students. Furthermore, they unite as a community within the larger network of 42 campuses worldwide. Currently, 42 Barcelona is meticulously refining a new offering to be shared with the other 42 campuses — an immersive one-week Discovery Piscine focused on cybersecurity, designed specifically for prospective students.
“Our first group of students who successfully completed the Piscine expressed a keen interest in cybersecurity. They took the initiative to conduct workshops on the subject, and that sparked the idea of creating a week-long program to introduce cybersecurity from scratch. We anticipate being able to offer this program to everyone in the coming months. We take immense pride in the fact that this content was developed by our very own students!”Humbert Ruiz, Director of 42 Barcelona
“At 42 Barcelona, we have a strong sense of community. Yes, they study together, but they also go out together and want to wear our tee-shirt to show off that they are from 42! This is really unique… and speaking of uniqueness, you won’t find our one-of-a-kind mascot, Octorok, anywhere else in the network!”Humbert Ruiz, Director of 42 Barcelona

If you watch Barcelona at this point, you would understand how aptly this gif epitomizes the current situation of the club, as we’re halfway through the season its looking like another one of those trophyless outings for the Catalan side. After already being out of the Spanish Super Cup & the Copa Del Rey technically they still have 2 major trophies to fight for including La Liga and the Champions League (yeah good luck with that!) but most fans have lost hope with this season. And now with Xavi leaving the club in the summer things are not looking good this season.
Let’s take a closer look at the underlying issues plaguing this club and how might Barca actually turn this around if they can that is.
Xavi as a player has been a core part of the Spanish national team and the mighty treble winning Barcelona squad which purely dictates his instinct as a manager and how he means to preserve the Barca DNA.
Since his arrival, Xavi has been using his 3–2–2–3 formation in possession or a 2–3–5 shape to great effect as seen below, this shape offers a lot of advantages in build up from the back and chance creation upfront.
This formation consists of a lone striker upfront as Lewandowski, two inside forwards preferably Pedri/Gavi & Gundogan, two wingers/wide players to hug the touchline preferably Balde & Lamine/Raphinha, two pivots preferably Frenkie & Cancelo/Romeu and 3 centrebacks preferably Christensen, Araujo & Kounde.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Xavi’s approach as he has used the same structure to win the league last season by scoring a lot of goals but also maintaining a solid rest defence at the back. Xavi wants his players to equally spread around the pitch and occupy each zone so that every player has passing options around them and can combine easily to escape pressure. Having 5 players in the front line enables them to frequently pull opposition players from the backline to create space with smart off-the ball movements.
With highly technical players deeper such as Frenkie, Gundogan they create loads of chances every game with balls over the top, line breaking passes, swerving crosses. Having Pedri, Gundogan & Gavi between the lines is important as they can easily receive the ball under pressure and turn in tight spaces to play the final pass. With young players such as Balde & Lamine Yamal in wide areas you get runners in-behind as well as players willing to take on fullbacks everytime. And with 3 solid centre-backs in defence they should (in theory) be able to defend well right?
But that is not the case this season, now let’s take a look at some of the issues holding this team back
After getting rid of Fati, Dembele, Eric Garcia and Ez Abde in the summer window Barcelona were mainly looking to add to their squad depth upfront. But with Barca’s never ending financial struggles, it meant that they can only look for less costly replacements, as a result Oriol Romeu and Inigo Martinez were signed to improve their squad depth at the back.
After showing interest in both João Félix and João Cancelo, Xavi was able to get both on loan, all thanks to them falling out with their respective clubs. Where Félix was looking for a fresh start while Cancelo was purely looking for regular playtime under Xavi. With this Barca capped of a decent summer window as compared to their Spanish rivals who went gung ho to improve their squad as well.
After a bothersome start to the season which saw Pedri & Frenkie getting injured and missing some important games in the first half of the season, Barca mostly relied on its youngsters with Lamine Yamal, Gavi and even Fermin getting some minutes every now and then.
Midway through the season they were hit hard by 2 more major injuries on regular first team players: Gavi and Ter Stegen which would see both of them missing the whole 23/24 season. Both of them were integral to Blaugrana’s success and the way they played last year which makes them difficult to replace.
A simple search query tells us that Barcelona have recorded the most xG in all of Europe’s top 5 leagues seconded only by Bayern Munich. But their lack of finishing up top has been a major concern as they have failed to hit the mark time and again. Though xG can be deceiving sometimes when teams attempt a lot of shots at goal, but if we look at npxG per shot Barca still ranks the highest in the league along with Girona.
While most top teams have exceeded their xG by scoring more with a fair margin Barcelona have struggled to put the ball in the back of the net, in fact among the top 15 teams in Europe they have the worst (Goals-xG) stat along with Chelsea (which is obviously not great company at the moment!).
Robert Lewandowski who has been a stellar striker throughout his career has been struggling to even make an impact this season, he’s been pretty subpar when it comes to linking up, making incisive runs and even controlling the ball in the penalty area.
Part of this decline is understandable as he is not in his prime any more and is probably enjoying what might be his last few years of playing at the top level. But, with lack of clear striking options for Barcelona where they loaned out Fati in the summer window, and Ferran & Felix both reluctant to fill the #9 position it has become quite tricky and definitely raises questions on the squad depth.
Though Vitor Roque who was signed in the winter as a long-term prospect might be able to challenge Lewandowski and provide cover for him at this moment.
Generally when we think of Barcelona we think of fast free flowing football, a team boasting of highly technical players all over the pitch playing proper Cruyff football. We rarely see Barcelona being associated with the word “defensive solidity”, but that is what happened last season when Barcelona displayed the best defensive record not just in the league but all over Europe!
A big part of this performance was Barcelona’s newly formed Back 4 which consisted of new summer signings Kounde & Christensen along with Araujo and a young academy prospect Alejandro Balde. This back 4 was Xavi’s preferred combination when fit which conceded just 20 goals in 38 league games and 46 goals in 55 matches across all competitions!
But this season, fans have seen a mere hint of past glory achieved by this combination as they’ve failed to keep clean sheets time and again and keep conceding goals to every opposition they play. Defensive errors at the back have become quite common and their defensive structure seems deformed most of the time. But, who is to blame?
Marc Andre Ter-Stegen who has been a loyal servant for the Blaugrana for almost a decade now, a club where he established himself as a world-class keeper and is undoubtedly the best ball-playing goalie in Europe right now is definitely being missed by everyone. He is a core part of the Barcelona defense as he vastly overperformed his expectations last season by keeping the most clean sheets in the league.
But Barca aren’t just missing his spider-like reflexes on the goal line, they are also missing his great passing range and ball playing prowess from the back. His ability to take charge against high pressing sides and playing a pinpoint ball to a free man upfront has been his career highlight and part of what makes him world-class.
Iñaki Peña who is currently filling for him in his absence has been subpar at best with a poor save percentage, he also clearly lacks the skillset Ter-Stegen has and still needs time to develop as a proper first team goalkeeper.
Conceding early goals almost every time has been the story so far this season as Barca conceded first in 7 out of 19 games before the winter break, with most of these goals coming just within 10 minutes post kickoff. As a result of the game state, Barca are bound to chase games every now and then which causes a lot of impatience among the players as they look to create chances as soon as possible.
Though this in theory should work in their favor but it has instead worked against them as an impatient pass during build up leaves them outnumbered at the back leading to a turnover at times when the defense isn’t expecting. This coupled with the fact that Barca have no natural ball-winners in midfield meaning their counterpressing has been pretty wasteful this season.
Of all injuries that have plagued this team, Barca were hit the hardest by Gavi’s absence, yes a 19-year old midfielder from La Masia is literally the heart and soul of this Barcelona team. His pressing intensity and passion for winning the ball back is unmatched not just in Barca but all over Europe.
The Golden Boy winner is already a regular starter for club & country and has been hailed by Xavi as irreplaceable in his side, despite his short stature he is brimming with confidence and always gives his best in every duel despite the odds. With Barcelona boasting of a highly technical midfield in Frenkie and Gundogan, Gavi provides the bite it needs to dominate every game.
After Busquets’ departure, who was arguably the greatest holding midfielder of his generation and someone who perfectly fit the job description and the style of play at Barcelona, Barca have struggled to match his numbers whether it maybe in defensive actions or the ball-playing abilities he had. Gavi definitely does not match his profile but has stepped up his game alongside Busquets and after his departure in the defensive shift he puts in each game. His ability to man-mark Bellingham and nullify his presence for 70 minutes in the El-Clasico is what amazed me the most this season.
Gavi’s still leading the charts in the number of tackles put in by Barca players despite being out for a major part of the season as shown below. In fact, he’s the #1 ball winner for the team in the attacking 3rd phase of the game and significantly reduces the number of turnovers Barca face.
Gavi is a player I personally adore a lot and he is someone whose mere presence would fix a lot of issues with this team right now. My personal favorite memory of him will always be winning an aerial duel against Wout Weghorst in the Champions League who with all due respect towers over him 😅.
The left-back role provides a tricky problem for the Catalan side in recent times which was sought to be over until the start of this season but instead grows even deeper. A 19-year old academy prospect Alejandro Balde in his breakout season showed the world why he deserves to be on the first-team sheet ahead of veteran full-back Jordi Alba. Balde exceeded everyone’s expectations and completely obliterated his critics with his stellar performances, despite that he has struggled this season and has definitely failed to make the same impact this year. But is it even Balde’s fault?
As discussed earlier Xavi wants to stretch the opposition backline by playing 5 forwards when in possession and in this system Balde is the one who provides width on the left hand side of the pitch. This totally suits Balde’s traits as he is a naturally offensive fullback who can easily slip past defenders relying solely on his pace.
Which brings me to my main point: Balde is an offensive fullback and NOT a WINGER! Look at these stats below comparing wide players from this and last season. Comparing his stats to a proper winger we can see that he attempts less take-ons than actual wingers and instead likes to go around the opposition backline.
While Balde definitely found success by taking on players last season he has been a shadow of his former self this season and part of the reason is that his game is not about taking on fullbacks or dribbling his way through the opposition backline with the ball. Instead it is more about the off the ball movements and the burst of pace he provides to attack space to play dangerous passes/crosses in the penalty area, which brings me to my final point.
Well “A picture is worth a thousand words” and if there is any truth to that adage here it is. Look at this image below, this picture clearly explains some issues with this squad that often go unnoticed.
This snapshot is from Barca playing against Real Betis which was also Balde’s last game after he was sidelined for the whole season. As we talked about Xavi’s structure before how he wants his players to occupy all zones when in possession so that every player has an outlet to play the ball to, in this case the left-half space is completely empty meaning that Balde has no one to combine with and has to play 1v2 against the two Betis players. This sequence results in Balde trying to take-on the fullback and playing an uncharacteristic cross which finds no one and possession is lost.
This issue is not limited to a particular sequence in this match, it has become a common theme among all matches this season which hinders Balde’s ability. The major issue here is player profiling, since the front five in possession consists of Lewandowski and Ferran playing together, both of whom like to drift into central areas and hence create this gap. Last season, this was not a problem as the front five usually consisted of Gavi and Pedri playing as the interiors so the wide players always found it easy to combine with them under pressure. But with Gavi, out of the picture Balde has been totally isolated on the left flank and can barely prove useful.
Barcelona have been blessed to have a Lamine Yamal among their ranks as the youngster has been beyond outstanding in his breakthrough season. In fact, Barca have been heavily reliant on this young prodigy this whole season who has lit up the league and is taking on every player left, right and center.
For me personally, Lamine has been the best forward in this team by a long shot and reminds me why I love watching this team. Despite being a 16-year old he is overflowing with confidence and is ready to take on defenders at will, escape from pressure and mature enough to release the ball at the right time. What amazes me is that he still has a lot of time to develop and with regular playing time in the coming seasons I’m thrilled to see what the future holds for him.
Gündoğan has been nothing short of world-class since the start of this season and has easily become the most consistent player in the squad. While all the other midfielders have been ridiculed with some form of injury in different phases of the season Gündoğan has been Xavi’s go-to-man in the middle of the park.
Due to his technical brilliance and reliability he has played more minutes than other player in the squad and has contributed in single phase of play. Though his preferred position is as an interior upfront, he has also played as a pivot covering for Frenkie in his absence making him extremely flexible. With the season coming to an end Barca could definitely use his clutch potential and big game mentality to save this season.
Though most of these issues and problems discussed above just seem to be small tactical tweaks & psychological issues with the players and their dropping intensity this season, which is not as bad as it looks. Since, Barca don’t necessarily need new personnel they just need to reinvigorate themselves and a couple of good results might just do that.
I hope this blog was worth your time if you made till the end, this took a lot of time & effort and was also my first attempt at bringing my Football knowledge & Data Analysis skills to the table.
Thank you for reading and have a good day! 😅

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

As usual, I kept being awake until on board and slept during the flight. This is the first time I have visited Spain. I could pass the immigration smoothly and head to the city centre by bus. Barcelona is warmer than London, so a half-sleeve T-shirt made me comfortable. After a 40-50-minute bus journey, I headed to the hostel on foot. Leaving my backpack, I went out for lunch.
ChatGPT recommended a restaurant close to the Sagrada Família. Although a paella was served for two as a minimum, when I asked, they would serve for one. So I could order one. I also had a bottle of beer that seemed to be local beer.
Following lunch, I went to the Sagrada Família directly. It was larger and had more colourful decorations than expected, so I felt it was more adorable than majestic. Whilst I wanted to enter, the admission ticket had sold out a long time ago. Therefore, I only watched its exterior.
I strolled through the city to visit other buildings by Gaudí, Casa Batlló and Casa Milà. I nibbled into a Starbucks store near Casa Batlló and bought a seasonal cold beverage with melon flavour. Though Starbucks UK also provides this drink, I didn’t know that. It was not too sweet, so I loved it.
Since I had nothing to do after watching Gaudí’s architecture, I tried to ask ChatGPT. However, due to fatigue, I slumbered on a bench. Even though the duration was shorter than that in Dublin, I thought this hot weather was causing me exhaustion. Upon waking up, I ventured through the city and popped into a gelato shop that caught my eye. I chose a lemon, one of my five favourite flavours, and a tiramisu. These were a little expensive, but I believe that they were worth their price. Especially, the lemon gelato was scrumptious.
When I finished the ice cream, it was evening. As is obvious from my nap, I was exhausted so much. So I decided to have supper earlier for tomorrow. I ordered four tapas and a glass of Clara, lemon beer, at a bar recommended by ChatGPT. All of the tapas were excellent, but I especially liked the Spanish omelettes with a good soup stock.
Leaving the bar, I detoured to a supermarket to buy a bottle of water. Browsing drink counters, a drink captivated my eye. It was AQUARIUS, a hydration drink, also sold in my country. However, I’d never seen it in other countries, including the UK, so I promptly grabbed it. The taste seems almost the same as the beverage sold in Japan. Nonetheless, I don’t remember the taste of the Japanese one in detail because I have never drunk it in over two years. Or maybe the Spanish one was a bit lighter in flavour than the Japanese one.

All it takes is a few terrible decisions to ruin years of success
The last few months have been shambolic for the once-revered FC Barcelona.
For years, their attacking flair, world-class player development, and a selfless “more than a club” mentality drove them to the pinnacle of the footballing world. Boasting outstanding talents from their youth academy, La Masia, like Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, and Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona won every major trophy there was to offer.
But in recent years, things began to falter. The inadequate spending of funds combined with La Masia producing less talent and a brainless short-term player transfer policy soon began to manifest itself on the pitch. Barcelona continued to struggle in Europe’s marquis competition, the UEFA Champions League, and this year’s embarrassing 8–2 defeat to Bayern Munich was the spark that lit the powder keg.
Lionel Messi, the club’s best player who has been at Barca since 2003, tried to enact a clause in his contract allowing him to leave for free at any point once the season was over in June. However, Barca is arguing that the clause is invalid due to the pandemic, and he instead would be sold for the outrageous fee of $700M. The end result is an ugly stalemate with Messi being held against his will by the club he’s given so much to. Talk about a fall from grace.
As fellow fans of the sport know, this disaster is something few could have expected with the vast amount of money and talent at their disposal. But even if you do not follow sports at all, there are lessons to be learned from this success turned disaster. It’s better to learn now since the downfall of a once-great organization is not new and will happen again. You just need to make sure that you take the necessary steps outlined in this piece to avoid your team or organization being one of them.
Leaders have radiating effects that have effects on the entire organization, whether they be good or bad.
A lot of the issues Barcelona currently face were due to one event: the election of Josep Bartomeu as club president.
Despite being someone who had been in the organization for many years, things looked different once Bartomeu took office. He was the one who took all of the things that made Barcelona successful and tampered with them, as I’ll get into in this article.
Consider you and who you appoint as leaders in your organization can impact the morale and the overall success of the people in it. Bartomeu’s stint has shown that leaders need to have a deep understanding of the organization they are in charge of and what has made them successful.
One of the underrated factors that went into Barcelona's downfall is the destruction of Barca’s academy to first-team supply chain fueled by La Masia. Most of the starting XI from Barca’s glory days honed their skills in-house at the academy and learned how to play football under the guidance of important club principles. It’s safe to say that the approach worked.
Under recent leadership, though, things have changed for the worse while under the guise of being better. In a new campaign called La Masia 360, they started straying away from what made the academy so successful in the first place, replacing the famous farmhouse with a glassy, office-like building and diversifying into other sports like basketball and floor hockey.
The changes don’t seem too bad on paper, but slowly the amount of talent that came off the assembly line was not on the same level as the world-beaters of previous eras. Unfortunately, the people at La Masia were too busy focusing on what other clubs like Real Madrid were doing and changing their philosophy accordingly rather than setting the tempo themselves.
Additionally, due to financial problems from irresponsible spending, Barcelona has been forced to sell any talented young players to try and cover their debt. A lot of the best talent from the academy with the best shot of starting for the first team ended up finding success at other clubs.
Without a reference and purpose for employees to follow, or constantly having turnover or having your brightest talents leave, you run the risk of the soul of the company being taken with them. Proper education and the right people in the right places will help define the identity of your organization.
Do not starve your golden goose. Evolution is necessary, but totally reshaping a tradition and philosophy, or straying too far from what made your team great, will only hurt in the long run.
Overreliance on the very few is a problem faced with many organizations and communities and can limit their potential for vast success.
In American football, the Green Bay Packers hit the jackpot when they selected generationally talented quarterback Aaron Rodgers with the 24th pick in the 2005 draft. However, Rodgers’ immense talent meant that the board felt that they should use other picks to strengthen different parts of the team, like the defense and o-line, rather than pick a star receiver that could showcase Rodgers’ talents. They never got back to a Super Bowl after 2011.
The city of NYC is in big trouble because they let so much power be given to so few. With so many rich people living in the Big Apple and contributing to a large part of the city’s economic success, they know that they have a lot of power over the people governing it. So when the COVID-19 pandemic came to town, the city’s rich fled in far larger numbers than other income brackets, leading to Andrew Cuomo’s embarrassing schmoozing of them to come back and talk over dinner.
The message is clear for all organizations: there needs to be a plan in place to make sure that a single unit does not become larger than the whole system.
What that means is different for every group. For Rodgers, it may have helped more to spend draft capital on a receiver than for Barcelona to spend $200M on attackers to help Messi.
The thing is, building a successful team around Lionel Messi in Barca might be the easiest job anyone could do. Even I could probably build a Barca team that could contend for the Champions League, especially after the $220 million influx of cash from the sale of Neymar to PSG.
Unfortunately, Barcelona has gone out and spent hundreds of millions on players that are redundant and do not fit the system. Training sessions went from intense to lazy. Actions like this are frustrating for the millions of fans who follow Barca through thick and thin.
One of the reasons Messi is discontent with the club, as stated in the interview, is that the upper management at Barcelona “had no project” and was mainly focused on plugging any holes in the short term. He could not be more correct.
In fact, after the 8–2 defeat to Bayern Munich president Bartomeu said that things would change in the club. Actions speak louder than words.
They appointed a new manager, but the board that got Barca into this mess is still there. They still are trying to auction off young talent and have not revamped the aging squad, continuing to plug holes and failing to set a long-term vision.
The truth is, short-term decisions aren’t really ones based on rational thinking: quite often, they are reactionary or a response to something like changing sentiment or a consequential event. It doesn’t help that Barca has a very political culture, as the fans vote in who is in charge at the club, which can fog objective decision-making.
The only way to stop a pernicious problem like this is to consciously prevent it. Unfortunately, it seems like nobody on the Barca board is aware of what’s happening.
Now that you know what to avoid, consider what you would do to prevent this situation:
It will be harder to do in practice than just think about but rest assured, history will remember you as the leader of a truly great team.

Unfortunately, Airbnb has decided to close its office in Barcelona after 8 years of cooperation with CPM, and now I’m jobless together with 1000 colleagues of mine.
Since 2012 Airbnb has relied on CPM in Barcelona to help hosts and travellers around the world. In 2016 Airbnb acquired the Barcelona start-up Trip4real from Gloria Molins (now Head of Business Incubations Experiences) and created Airbnb Experiences — one-of-a-kind activities designed and hosted by locals.
In March 2019 I joined the big international community of expats at CPM supporting Airbnb users in English, Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese and other languages. In January 2020 I became a member of a cool airbnbexperiences team, then we moved to a new big office, in March 2020 we started working from home… Just couple of days ago we were actively working and reading news that 100 of our colleagues in Ireland have already lost their jobs, and we had a hope that we will still be afloat. All of a sudden, it happened to us also and now almost 1000 people will be unemployed. ⠀
Travel industry was hit hard, and even a giant like Airbnb could not stand it. This is understandable, because now the company has only expenses as everyone cancels their reservations (even for 2021), and income will appear only when we all begin to travel again.
We are not yet fired, but Airbnb has cut all access to their internal tools for us, so we have no work to do. This was communicated to us by our management from CPM without any prior notice (and CPM knew about this decision 20 days before announcing it to us), and we even couldn’t finish our last cases. It felt quite disrespectful how it was done, even with a nice words and empathy.
Airbnb is passionate about its values “Community first” and we were well taught how to promote it to all Airbnb users. Just now we are out of this community like never were inside it…
Also this March Airbnb launched its Service Promise what we needed to spread to each member of Airbnb community:
Then Airbnb has created different support programs to support community during tough times:
But Airbnb hasn’t even said a proper goodbye to its largest international office in Barcelona leaving 1000 people without work.
News about Airbnb closing and letting jobless almost 1000 people were immediately picked up by the main Spanish media El Pais and El Periodico.
The breakup with Airbnb wasn’t on a very positive note, lots of people are not happy how it has ended. Nevertheless, I want to say that thanks to my more than 1-year experience here I’ve got valuable insights about cross-cultural communications, improved my soft skills, learned cool examples of Airbnb marketing campaigns and helped travelers and hosts around the world to solve all kinds of situations they have had.
Especially I will miss our international atmosphere with constant discussions of funny and strange cases, our cooking classes, theme parties and all my teams with great people😔
I believe that the main thing about losing a job is not a dead end, but it’s a start of a new future. Despite all current difficulties we will sort it out as we have no choice. I think we have learned how to solve various life situations with Airbnb users, so it’s time to focus on our own. Good luck to everyone!

Known for its stunning architecture, vibrant culture, and pristine beaches, Barcelona is quickly cementing itself as a booming gravity center for tech and innovation.
The emergence of unicorns such as Glovo (acquired by Delivery Hero), TravelPerk, Belvo and eDreams has spurred the development of the city’s startup ecosystem. This, together with a favorable business climate has bolstered the accessibility of venture capital. According to a new report by Dealroom, Spanish startups now exceed €100 billion in total valuation.
Several experts agree. The Boston Consulting Group has ranked Barcelona as the fifth most attractive city in the world for digital professionals. It also ranks sixth on EU-Startups’ list of the largest European startup hubs. The excitement around the city’s potential is such that Jordi Ribas, corporate VP of Search & AI at Microsoft, said it “has all the necessary elements to become the ‘Silicon Valley of Europe’ in the next 10 years.
In this article, I will assess Barcelona’s potential to live up to this promise, by examining its achievements and prospects in the technology industry.
First of all, Barcelona is strategically positioned as a gateway between Europe and other countries. Thanks to its international airport, as well as the seaport, there is no problem to go to any part of the world and back.
Also, the city’s development strategy has created spaces that facilitate collaboration and creativity. For example, the area of Poblenou was transformed into an urban innovation and technology center — 22@ Barcelona Innovation District. Spaces like these tend to be a magnet for founders, and add a layer of appeal to an already enticing place.
Priscilla Lavoie, a marketing expert based in Barcelona, expands on this. “I think the general attractiveness of Barcelona — the culture, great weather, and central location within Europe — makes it easier for companies in the city to attract tech talent from across the globe. People are willing to move here, which makes the talent pool much larger,” she states.
No innovation ecosystem can flourish without access to capital. Hence, part of Barcelona’s recent prowess is linked to the growth of available funding. According to the Barcelona and Catalonia Startup Ecosystem Report, Catalan startups raised over €5 billion between 2019–2023, 231% more capital than in the previous five-year period. Another report, Mobile World Capital’s Startup Ecosystem Overview, states that Barcelona startups have secured 66.4% of all investments in Spain. It is also worth remarking that according to Dealroom, sectors like climate tech and biotechnology, which hold some of the most promising ventures right now, are snatching most of the capital available for Spanish startups.
This has resulted in a thriving ecosystem. For example, the same Catalonia Startup Ecosystem Report mentions that Barcelona ranks fifth in terms of tech scaleups, with 283. This means companies that have survived the startup stage and have demonstrated their viability. At the same time, projects like the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which now boasts over 150 research projects, create a cluster effect and foster collaboration between academia, Big Tech — Intel, Cisco and IBM, to name a few, are partners of the center — and innovators.
As sizable amounts of funding now gravitate towards deep tech, Barcelona could even have more to win. “Key developments like the recent addition of international submarine cables and the expansion of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center are making the city a prime location for startups in the quantum, AI, and health sectors,” said Nicolás Ventura, Head of Operations at Club GLOBALS, a growth network for tech leaders.
No ecosystem is complete without government support, as founders tend to relocate to entrepreneur-friendly hubs where they can focus on growing their businesses. To increase the region’s allure and attract talented innovators, the Government of Catalonia established ACCIÓ, the agency of business competitiveness. Through its Startup Capital program, ACCIÓ is granting €45,000 to promising tech-based startups. At the same time, the organization is lobbying for policies that make it easier to set up a company in the region.
In 2023, the federal government introduced a nationwide initiative dubbed the Spain Startup Law, which encompassed reducing the corporate tax rate from 25% to 15% for a maximum of 4 years — as long as the company was still considered a startup — and implementing a digital nomad visa to make it easier for international founders to settle. Other measures, such as a 10-year tax exemption on up to €50,000 on stock-based compensation per year, are intended to make it easier to secure talent.
However, there are caveats. To qualify for some of these exemptions, companies needed to be certified by Enisa, a new government agency. Sifted reported that by the end of 2023, only 600 startups were certified out of an expected total of 10,000. Despite these challenges, though, the move seems to have worked with investors. Even if overall VC funding was meager in the last couple of years, Spain seems to have developed more resilience to the global slump.
In Europe, cities like Berlin, London, and Madrid are vying with Barcelona to attract and retain top talent. Compared to some of these European hubs, Barcelona has several competitive advantages. The cost of living is lower than in London or other places like Stockholm, and the lenient weather and more social lifestyle could also have a say.
This, by itself, is not enough though. For companies to have access to a stable stream of talent, a city needs to have thriving universities and research institutions. This is definitely the case for barcelona. Institutions such as GBSB Global and business schools like ESADE, EADA, and IESE, which are listed in the top ranks in Europe, can provide plenty of talent, mentorship, entrepreneurs, and even interns to Barcelona’s start-up scene.
Incubators and accelerators play a key role in boosting a city’s tech scene. Barcelona abounds with them. One of them is Startup Grind, a global community that, through its chapter in the city, has helped connect innovators through gatherings, keynote speeches, and fireside chats. Norrsken, a Swedish impact tech powerhouse, has also set up shop in the city and opened a startup house, as well as Tech Barcelona, a private non-profit that has played a pivotal role in integrating technology into the city.
There are also many top-notch events, something that Nicolás Ventura alludes to. “The city is home to some of the biggest tech conferences in the world, like MWC/4YFN, which gathers over 100,000 tech leaders annually, and the Smart City Expo, which draws global attention and fosters international collaboration on critical issues,” he says. If some factors are paramount to attracting talented individuals, this might be one of the keys to getting them to stay.
Spain’s economic fluctuations can affect investment in innovation. If the overall country’s economy experiences a downturn, funding for startups and research projects might be reduced, causing the founders of these ventures to flock elsewhere.
Bureaucracy can be another problem. As I mentioned, there have been hiccups in the full implementation of Spain’s Startup Law. Canada had a similar problem and presents a cautionary tale. Even though the Startup Visa program looked good on paper, its long wait times diminished its appeal, until many companies chose to establish elsewhere.
Also, there needs to be a careful balance. While growth is good, something that happened in Silicon Valley, for example, is that the excess of capital benefited people who worked for a few companies, but resulted in a prohibitive cost of living for the rest. This led fledgling entrepreneurs to look for other places to start their businesses.
If Barcelona falls behind in some of the aspects presented above, other cities might capitalize on that. There is an intensified competition not only across Europe, but around the world. And despite Spain’s attractiveness, it is still, according to Dealroom, a mid-tier player.
To make a point of comparison, French startups reached a total valuation of €100 billion six years ago, and German startups nine years ago. Does this mean that Spain is lagging that much? Not necessarily, since growth can be exponential. However, it signals something more important. Ambitious startup founders do not hesitate to leave a place where they don’t feel supported.
Compared to professionally-oriented cultures like the United States, Spain is much more relaxed and focused on work-life balance. Also, business tends to center more around relationships.
This is evident in the Hofstede dimension scores. Spain scores low on motivation compared to the US, and high on indulgence. While overall this is not necessarily bad, it is important to strike a balance. Too much pleasure and too little work could cause Barcelona’s startup dreams to flounder.
Does this mean that talented individuals with a big vision will leave? Lena Shagieva, founder of PreggApp, an AI-powered pregnancy tracker, has an interesting perspective. “There is a reason why there is only one Silicon Valley. After experiencing living there and living here (Barcelona) now, I can tell, these places are built for different lives. Silicon Valley is a place with a laser focus on success, on money. It’s a high-octane rat race,” she remarks.
Finally, it could also boil down to money. While capital available is increasing, deal flow is still slow compared to other hubs. “Barcelona has great potential, however, I believe there is a need for a more virtuous circle of money flowing into the ecosystem for it to become the EU Valley,” said Priscilla Lavoie.
She also commented that, “while we have seen interesting exits in the last 5–10 years, the majority of large investors in these companies were from the US, UK, and France, so most of the money leaves Spain and doesn’t really support our ecosystem at home.”
Lena Shagieva also touches on this. “It can be an optic problem, or because money is expensive here, but at the end of the day, businesses need money and startups need to see actual deals happening — know people who have had big money exits,” she says.
The point of comparing many cities to Silicon Valley has been made countless times. Many places have been there — Tel Aviv, the Kitchener-Waterloo corridor, Austin and Seattle, to name a few. However, it is always a misleading comparison, because every city has unique aspects that contribute to its development or lack thereof.
Hence, the idea of Barcelona becoming the “Silicon Valley of Europe” is not accurate. Silicon Valley has singular conditions that result in a high concentration of unicorns, and setting such standards can create unrealistic expectations for Barcelona.
I rather endorse the vision of Luis Cabiedes, one of Spain’s most well-known VCs and angel investors, who states that Spain needs to develop its own model rather than trying to imitate Silicon Valley. In this regard, it is unlikely that Barcelona can rival Silicon Valley in scale. Yet, it still has the potential to become a significant player in the European tech landscape, and to do it in its own way — leveraging its strengths and distinctive advantages.

Gràcia, also known as the Vila de Gràcia (village of Grace) lives up to its name. Many years after its establishment, it is still a small, tranquil “village” in the middle of Barcelona’s vast, urban sprawl. Founded in 1626 as a convent, it wasn’t until 1897 that it became a part of Barcelona. That pivotal moment belongs to the larger story of Barcelona’s transition from small town to metropolis; other neighborhoods, such as Sants and Sarrià, are also formally independent municipalities that were annexed by Barcelona during Idefons Cerdà’s expansion of the city starting with his Eixample Plan in 1859.
Today, the neighborhood lives on as a peaceful zone that harbors small businesses and wards off through traffic. Gràcia’s extensive use of creative urban planning measures, like Salvador Rueda’s concept of “superblocks,” means that cars must share the streets with pedestrians, bikers, and children on scooters. It boasts more than 10 lovely plazas, where you can sit for a coffee or “far un vermut,” while kids play in front of you and their parents gossip beside you.
Though it is not one of the first neighborhoods listed in guidebooks, Gràcia is home to many treasures. Among them is the first home designed by Antoni Gaudì, Casa Vicens. Recognized as one of the Art Nouveau movement’s first buildings, it has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The house was originally built as a summer home for the Vicens family in the 1880s. It was closed to the public until 2017 when it opened as a museum. There is some mystery surrounding its patriarch, Señor Manuel Vicens i Montaner. Records indicate that he was a professional stockbroker and currency dealer, though many historians have referred to him as the owner of a tile factory. Given the tiles ostentatiously engulfing the exterior of the building, the latter is certainly plausible.
In 1992, an air-raid shelter was discovered beneath Gràcia’s Plaça del Diamant. The planes’ main targets were the many factories once situated throughout the area. The shelter protected more than 200 people during the Spanish Civil War and is one of the biggest of the 1,300 shelters that were built in Barcelona during that time. Guided tours are offered every Sunday at 11 AM, but reservations must be made online.
Gràcia is a more bohemian-natured neighborhood. Walking around you will notice many shops with hand-painted murals on their doors. One could say this makes it an outdoor art gallery in and of itself. Some of the murals are exquisite works of art, relating to the store’s offerings. You’ll also come across colorful beer cans painted with quotes and pinned to the walls of buildings. These inspiration messages and love notes are done by a mysterious, unknown couple with a beautiful love story.
Gràcia has several shopping promenades where you’re sure to find many small boutiques and artisanal shops. Start at Olokuti on Carrer d’Astúries. This general store sells just about everything and its wares are produced using sustainable materials and processes. Even if you aren’t interested in buying something, there is a beautiful secret garden, accessible from the back of the store.
For clothing, continue down Astúries to La Comet, a small, independent boutique full of made-in-Barcelona pieces and gorgeous gold jewelry. Others to check out are Ktu Barcelona and Padam, as well as Natural Mediterrani, which sells natural soaps and bath products.
Carrer de Verdi links up with Carrer d’Astúries, just past Plaça del Diamant. If you’re looking for great shoes, try Vialis, Mauro’s BCN or Streeters. Salvador Mallol Joier, Bell Estiu, and Pia Barcelona have exquisite jewelry. For clothing, take a peek at Vos Shop and KLING.
Carrer de Bona Vista is another area for fashion finds, with a few more upscale, haute couture shops. POISON Jewels sells one-of-a-kind adornments. Be Store has great gifts for friends and family. Browse BOO, IKA, and Mushi Mushi if you’re looking for quality, locally-crafted clothing. Rêveries has a variety of vintage luxury items. At the end of the street, turn right onto Passeig de Gràcia and you’ll find Lupo, another local atelier, which makes all of its handbags in-house.
Let me follow this by telling you that Gràcia is also a foodie haven. Smaller versions of the well-known Boqueria, Mercat de la Llibertat and Mercat de l’Abaceria are located on the neighborhood’s borders. In the middle, an old, run-down market on Carrer de Puigmartí is being renovated. As for restaurants, there are simply too many homey, independent, quirky establishments to tell all, but I can highlight a few of my favorites.
Mama’s Cafe offers an excellent American-style breakfast, with great coffee and a small backyard garden. For lunch, Taverna el Glop and Il Giardinetto Di Gracia have tasty, very Catalan dishes. If you go during the week you can experience what is known as “el menu del dia.” For the best pizza in Barcelona, sit down at Garden Pizza by Rafa Panattieri, a Brazilian-Italian chef with ties to the famous Roca Brothers.
El Cafè del Teatre and Chatelet are both wonderful, cozy spots to stop in the late afternoon for a glass of wine before heading to a movie at Cines Verdi, which shows many English-language movies with Spanish subtitles.
Bodega Quimet serves up traditional tapas at good prices and with their house wine. At the end of your meal, you can even take home a bottle of what you’ve tried — the concept is to taste the wines accompanied by small snacks. La Xula Taperia is a more modern, Mediterranean-fusion, experimental take on Catalan tapas.
Plenty of places for a nightcap can be found just by strolling around. But some no-fail recommendations are Viblioteca, whose play-on-words title explains itself, and El Ciclista, the area’s staple hipster cocktail bar. At Bobby Gin you can try variations on Spain’s favorite cocktail, gin & tonic.
Looking for live music? Take your pick: Soda Acústic, Cueva de Lobos, and La Sonora de Gràcia are all reputed venues, though be prepared to snuggle up to strangers if you so choose. If you’d like to move your feet, Gràcia Latina and El Sabor are there for a salsa dancing adventure.
Catalunya and the rest of Spain take their partying very seriously.
If you’re lucky enough to arrive in Barcelona during August, you may get to join in celebrating Gràcia’s biggest party of the year. During summer, each of Barcelona’s neighborhoods puts on a several-day block party, known as the “Festa Major.”
In Gràcia, locals spend weeks preparing for their August party, by building elaborate decorations and stages out of recycled materials. Restaurants sell food and drinks, and musicians and DJs play concerts on almost every corner. The annual festival even has its own website and office space to organize the event.
The best way to arrive is via metro. Though there are no metro stations directly in the center, Gràcia is accessible by the L3 (the green line), L4 (the yellow line), and L5 (the blue line). Metro stations Diagonal and Verdaguer have their exits at the bottom border of the neighborhood, while Joanic and Fontana are further up on Gràcia’s outer edges. Once you get there, you’ll enjoy meandering in as it will give you the chance to experience more of the area on foot, which is exactly how it should be.

“Peace is not something you wish for; it’s something you make, something you do, something you are, and something you give away.” — John Lennon
We all nurture, nourish, support and sustain ourselves in different ways. Nurture through grounding may not be a way for everybody and vice versa. We are all way too used to hearing people tell us how to take care of ourselves through instagram, tiktok, wellness groups and other channels that surround us. And although it might be a good way to begin exploring and discovering which self-care means work for you — it can be quite overwhelming.
And that is why I am not here to tell you how and give you unnecessary advise, I am here to simply share and reflect on my experiences. On what makes me feel better after a long day, helps to quiet down my anxiety and connect with the present. If it inspires you to visit some of these places — we share a taste in self-care routines, if not — I would love to hear what you have to say about your ways to keep sane in the world that cannot stop moving.
Below, are some of the places and initiatives I discovered in Barcelona that contribute to nurturing my body and soul.
A tiny, intimate yoga studio in Born offers a unique space unlike any other. I am not a fan of the big, sterile yoga spaces that are common in London or gym chains. The studio features a welcoming reception, a single studio, and a chill-out room, creating the perfect environment to feel at home and familiar. The Chill-out Room at the back of the house almost always encourages me to arrive 10–20 minutes before class to cuddle up on the huge sofa with Claudia’s dog Turron, take a couple of breaths, and shield myself from the hectic outside world.
A wide range of classes is available, from early morning to late evening, to help you start or end your day. There are also more focused workshops, such as those for handstands, outdoor yoga classes with views of the sea, and more experimental activities like “Soltar y Estar” movement classes with Anna Viklund (she deserves a special section, so read below).
A few words from the founder Claudia Paz:
The inspiration comes from a personal need. I wanted a place where I could fully relax and disconnect from the busyness of everyday life, a safe haven to practice with teachers who genuinely focus on my practice and connection. I envisioned a space finished to a high standard, where I could feel fully secure. Casa Paz is different because it’s personalized; all the teachers are amazing instructors. The personal touch is very important — we know the names of our students and genuinely care about them. I love seeing this connection transfer to the students, who often walk through the door with a relieved expression, saying, “Finally, I’m here.”
My favorite mantra, which I often repeat to myself, is “This has already been resolved on its own; the universe has already taken care of this. Everything is going to be okay.” This phrase has been with me for over a year. Sometimes we fight or get mad at certain situations, but the reality is that we can’t control everything: what others think about us, what they do, or how situations unfold. What we can do is be aware of ourselves and give our best. If a day is bad or we have a conflict with someone, the best we can do is learn from it and observe how we can do better next time. We have to focus more on our own path, be respectful to others, and treat ourselves with more compassion.
So many come to mind because each has taught me a lot. But one that has been with me for a longer time and brought me a friend to help in my practice is Urdhva Dhanurasana, the wheel pose. It is a challenging pose for me. I remember as a kid just jumping around doing it, but as I grew up, it became more challenging due to the meaning it holds for me. Especially in the drop back to the wheel, it is a moment of full trust in yourself. It requires, in my opinion, a lot of self-confidence, and that is something I have been working on a lot in the last few years. For me, everything is in that pose: the strength, the connection with the earth through your hands and feet, and looking back with your chest fully open really makes me feel a sense of acceptance.
We have a room at the back of the shala that our community calls “The Chill Out Room.” This is where people relax, connect, read, and drink tea throughout the day between classes. It’s a space for all our members to come whenever they need a little break. It’s designed for our community to meet one another and connect away from the mat to form friendships. My thoughts on yoga teachings are that, as instructors, we are in service to the students. They come to practice because they are looking for something, even if that something is only the final savasana (relaxation). We strive to provide a comfortable and safe practice for everyone.
The month of May was a time of reflection on my body. I worked daily to better understand my relationship with my body, identify the traumas that shaped this relationship, and find ways to improve it through various practices.
One thing I realized was that I did not feel comfortable moving in public spaces as I wanted to. I felt constrained and anxious to the point where I would stop dancing altogether or simply mimic the patterns around me without truly understanding what I wanted to do.
As part of this realization, I decided to take some body expression workshops. Almost by design, I came across the Soltar y Estar initiative led by the incredible Anna Viklund.
“Soltar y Estar” — “Release and Just Be” — are spaces free from judgment, instructions, and expectations. They allow you to enter a meditative state and play with your body through movement, meditation, and group connection. For me, this is a space where I come in with no expectations and leave with a tired body, a clear mind, and valuable lessons learned. Anna manages to challenge but never push, encourage but never force, lead but never dictate.
In addition to group classes, which have a special energy due to their communal nature, Anna also offers personalized one-on-one workshops — something I have yet to experience. In just a few weeks, dance transformed from something I dreaded into something I couldn’t wait to do.
A few words from the founder Anna Viklund:
Soltar y Estar is a conscious playground where you get to connect with your own body. It’s a safe space that we create as a group where each session is a unique journey but with a fixed destination- The present. Listening leads us to connection, which leads us to openness, curiosity removes judgment and invites us to move. The movement invites us to play, where we release the control and forget about our identities. And there we find ourselves in pure joy, vitality and compassion. A soft body and a sharp mind. Soltar y Estar is pure Body Expression! It’s a wonderful way to get to know people through a moving body.
Movement for me is feeling myself. Movement is home, it’s expressing and listening. Movement is clarity! Movement is massage, meditation and cleanse. Movement is to get drunk and to get sober at the same time. Movement is to explore, play and create. Movement is getting to know myself. Movement is vitality. Movement is absolutely necessary for me to be able to be a present and conscious person.
Our body is our greatest teacher and we are our own healers. All we have to learn is to listen.
If I am my authentic self, I invite people to be authentic too. When I open up, you open up.
Dance and movement is a very powerful way to get to know yourself and your own body. Dancing in contact with another person is a very powerful meeting. Dance without a shape and without rules is very healing. Dance loses 100% of its magic if you start comparing yourself with others and when you lose the connection with your inner world.
Trying new things is connected with curiosity. Curiosity can replace judgements. What ever you are judging within yourself or in others could completely change perspective if you choose to look at is with curiosity, for example “I can’t dance, I’m feeling like a loser” vs “interesting, every time I move in front of people I get insecure, what would happen if I practiced that’”. Trying new things opens up your mind, breaks your patterns and is a straight portal to self growth.
Yet another multi-experiential space combining all aspects of well-being is located in the heart of Barcelona at Placa de Tetuan. The thinking behind Frizzant is quite innovative; the space is designed to support all the daily activities of our community: working, participating in conscious movement classes (yoga, dance, etc.), socializing, and enjoying meals in a cozy, inspiring environment. Does this cover pretty much everything I aim to do in a day? Yes.
I have to commend the designer of the space — it is one of the most beautiful and thoughtfully designed modern studios I have ever encountered. I was truly fascinated the first time I showed up for a class here. Regarding the classes, Frizzant represents the modern evolution of yoga: a dynamic, social, and urban practice that avoids dogma and encourages body expression and emotional growth.
The café offers a unique selection of fresh fruits and vegetables — something you don’t often see, even in most supermarkets, where cucumbers are suffocating in plastic wrappers.
A few words from the founder Sonia Sala:
(Courtezy of https://frizzant.com/)
For me, there is no better way to ground oneself than by connecting with nature. It’s a free, accessible way to remind yourself where you come from. “Accessible” may sound like an overstatement when living in the chaos known as the city, but I will try to break the stereotype that nature in Barcelona is always at least a day-long escape.
Montjuic
Every time I head to Montjuïc, I end up in a different place. I still struggle to grasp just how big it is, what it hides inside, and where it ends. Apart from a beautiful hike offering a fantastic view of the city, with hidden nature-filled spots, forests, and parks, Montjuïc also offers a wide range of historical gems to entertain your mind. You can easily spend more than a few hours here, breathing much cleaner air than down below. Multiple foundations, Montjuïc Castle, and the Roman Theatre are scattered around the maze of Montjuïc, ready to entertain. I encourage you to walk without a map and see where you end up, because I bet you will discover something new every time you come back.
The Sea
Oh, how incredibly lucky I am to have the sea in Barcelona. Having experienced living by the sea, I can never go back. One of the true sources of happiness, energy, and peace for me is hearing the sound of the waves and seeing them crash along the coast — no matter the weather, no matter the season.
My favorite places to sit by the sea:
Always remember to make time for yourself.
See you in the next one,
Anya

Have you ever wondered how a storied club like FC Barcelona tackles financial challenges while enhancing fan engagement? In today’s evolving sports landscape, Barcelona has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) as a crucial tool for improvement. By integrating AI into various operations, the club aims to elevate on-field performance, enhance fan experiences, and make smarter financial decisions. This transformation illustrates how innovation can lead to sustainable success in a highly competitive environment.
In recent years, Barcelona has faced significant financial hurdles, accumulating a staggering debt of €1.35 billion. In light of this daunting reality, the club recognized the importance of harnessing technology to strengthen connections with its vast global fan base. The sports world has seen how data-driven approaches can personalize experiences, enabling organizations to better understand and cater to the preferences of their supporters. By leveraging AI, Barcelona is positioning itself to innovate and thrive amidst challenges.
One of Barcelona’s innovative steps into AI is the implementation of AI-powered chatbots designed to engage fans in real time. These chatbots provide personalized content based on individual preferences, making interactions feel tailored and efficient. Fans can quickly find answers to questions about ticket purchases or player stats, simulating a conversation with a knowledgeable friend. This not only enhances the fan experience but also drives merchandise sales. Studies show that 69% of consumers prefer chatbots for fast communication with brands, reflecting the growing expectation for swift responses in today’s digital world.
These chatbots are adept at handling up to 80% of routine customer service inquiries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex issues. In many industries, organizations have turned to AI to enhance customer service, enabling faster responses and improving overall satisfaction. Barcelona’s approach illustrates a blend of technology and personal touch, emphasizing the importance of understanding fan needs and preferences.
Barcelona has also embraced AI algorithms to analyze fan data and deliver personalized content. By tailoring news articles, videos, and social media posts to individual preferences, the club significantly enhances the overall engagement of its supporters. The club’s dedicated Twitter account for personalized content has witnessed a remarkable 30% increase in engagement compared to its main account. This level of engagement mirrors the success of leading brands that utilize consumer data to create relevant experiences, ultimately driving sales.
Furthermore, this personalized content strategy has resulted in a 25% increase in the time fans spend on Barcelona’s digital platforms. Insights from behavioral psychology emphasize that when users feel valued and recognized, they are more likely to engage with a brand. By leveraging AI for tailored content, Barcelona fosters a deeper connection with its supporters, ensuring they feel appreciated and involved in the club’s journey.
Barcelona’s commitment to innovation extends to its training facilities through a partnership with Pixellot, which has developed AI-based video analysis systems. This technology automates the recording of training sessions and matches, providing coaches with in-depth insights into player performance. In the competitive world of sports, analytics have become essential, much like how successful teams leverage data to inform strategies and enhance player development.
The impact of AI-driven video analysis has been significant, with coverage now expanded to 16 pitches across Barcelona’s complexes. This increased visibility has enabled the club to broadcast previously unproduced youth matches, resulting in a staggering 40% increase in viewership. Such advancements illustrate how data analytics can reveal opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed, allowing teams to engage more deeply with fans and cultivate future talent.
In addition to enhancing fan interactions and on-field performance, Barcelona utilizes AI tools to analyze fan preferences and behaviors. This strategic approach allows the club to create more effective marketing strategies and build deeper connections with its audience. For example, AI-driven insights have led to a remarkable 20% increase in merchandise sales, illustrating the power of targeted marketing efforts.
Moreover, Barcelona has achieved a 15% improvement in fan engagement metrics across its digital platforms. This proactive stance reflects the importance of data-driven decision-making in today’s business landscape, where understanding consumer behavior can lead to substantial gains. These insights highlight how critical it is for organizations to stay attuned to the needs and desires of their audience.
The cumulative impact of these AI-driven initiatives has been impressive. Barcelona has reported a 35% increase in digital engagement year-over-year and has expanded its global fan base from 250 million to an estimated 350 million supporters. This growth illustrates that fans are not just passive observers; they are actively involved in the club’s journey and development.
While the advancements in AI present a promising future, the club also faces challenges, particularly in data collection. Despite its massive fan base, as of 2022, Barcelona held detailed data on only about 1% of its supporters, highlighting a critical area for improvement. This situation emphasizes the need for organizations to continually enhance their data strategies to build stronger connections with their audiences.
Barcelona’s successful integration of AI not only enhances performance but also presents a unique business opportunity model for other clubs and organizations. By focusing on fan engagement, personalized marketing, and data analysis, sports teams can cultivate a loyal fan base and drive revenue growth. The lessons learned from Barcelona’s journey serve as a blueprint for others looking to navigate similar challenges and harness the power of technology in sports.
Moreover, this model isn’t limited to sports; businesses in various sectors can leverage similar strategies. The principles of personalization and data-driven decision-making are increasingly becoming standard practices across industries. In a world where consumer preferences are constantly evolving, understanding and adapting to these changes is essential for long-term success.
Ultimately, Barcelona’s journey into AI amidst financial struggles offers valuable life lessons. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances is vital, both in sports and in life. By embracing innovation, individuals and businesses can overcome obstacles and create new opportunities. As author and philosopher Alain de Botton reminds us in The Art of Travel: “We are often at our most interesting when we are in a state of uncertainty.” Barcelona’s story illustrates how a shared passion for the game can unite fans and inspire creative problem-solving.
As we reflect on Barcelona’s commitment to AI and fan engagement, it’s clear that the essence of connection — whether with fans, customers, or communities — remains paramount. Building relationships rooted in understanding and empathy can lead to enduring success. In a world of rapid change, the lessons learned from Barcelona’s experience serve as a reminder that with innovation and resilience, the future can be brighter than ever. (Dadang Irsyamuddin)

Barça’s 2023–24 season is being far from good. They’re currently 6 points away from the leader but with one more match played — so the difference could rise to 9 points today — and the number of goals they’ve received this year in 18 games is already higher than the total goals from last season.
Not good defensively, but the offense doesn’t compensate for it.
In this post, I’ll oversimplify the causes of Barça’s situation focusing on numbers only. Of course, these only explain half the equation: the apathy or lack of motivation we’re seeing on the pitch can’t be translated into numbers… Yet.
But stats are rather the consequence of these psychological factors.
If you’re a FCB fan and have been following their last games, I might not discover anything new here. But I believe this could be a good read for those who don’t and those who want to learn how to use stats to understand the game.
Here’s a summary of Barça’s last 5 matches, ordered chronologically:

How I Felt Watching Barcelona Lose – A Fan's Honest Thoughts
It’s not just a football match. It’s not just a scoreline.When Barcelona loses, it feels like a piece of my heart gets bruised.
I still remember the feeling. The final whistle blows. The players drop their heads. And I just sit there, silent, staring at the screen. Not because of the loss—but because of the love. The deep connection I’ve built with this club since I was a kid.
When I watch them lose, I’m not just disappointed. I feel helpless. Because no matter how much I scream at the screen, nothing changes. And yet—I stay. Every game. Every season. Because I believe.
But this loss… it hit harder. Maybe because of how it happened. Maybe because we expected more. Or maybe because I’m just tired of defending a team that sometimes forgets how much they mean to people like us.
Still—I’ll never walk away. Because true fans don’t run when it hurts. We just keep loving harder.

The House on Tibidabo in The Shadow of the Wind
One day during our trip to Barcelona a few years ago we decided to ride all the way to the top of Mount Tibidabo, the highest hill in the city. We had to ride on three separate means of transportation to get to the top, but we did it!
First of all, we walked to the Metro station at Placa de Catalunya and boarded the brown line (L7) train which took us to the base of Avenguda Tibidabo. Then we walked across the street from the Metro exit to board the Tramvia Blau, an old streetcar line, which brought us halfway up the mountain. Finally, we transferred to the Funicular de Tibidabo to get to the top.
There at the top we found an old amusement park adjacent to a Catholic church called Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor (The Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Heart). You can see this church and some of the park’s rides from just about anywhere in Barcelona. And we soon found out that you can get one of the best views of Barcelona from the roof of this church.
In Carlos Ruiz Zafon’s masterpiece The Shadow of the Wind we follow Daniel Sempere as he traces the journey of Julian Carax (the author of a book also called The Shadow of the Wind) to the Tibidabo mansion where his love Penelope resides. Zafon himself loved to ride the tram and then the funicular to the top and gaze at the view of Barcelona. The tram opened in 1901 and the blue cars reminded me of San Francisco’s fabled cable cars. It was thrilling to consider that we may have ridden on the same car that carried both Zafon and Sempere up Tibidabo.
There are many turn-of-the-century mansions that line the slopes of Tibidabo. The most prominent is El Pinar, the home of the banker Manuel Arnus near the base of the funicular and the end of the line of the blue tram. I photographed this house after exiting the funicular on the way back down Tibidabo. I at first thought that this was Zafon’s mansion but later discovered that Zafon himself told us that the address of Torre Aldaya in The Shadow of the Wind was Avenguda Tibidabo 32, which is a few hundred meters down the hill. The building at this address is not as gothic looking like El Pinar and Zafon probably combined the appearances of several Tibidabo mansions when he imagined Torre Aldaya. The building at # 32 is now the Hotel Mirlo, a five-star boutique hotel.
El Pinar was designed by the famous architect Enric Sagnier in 1902 and the house was completed in 1904. Sagnier also designed the magnificent Sagrat Cor at the top of Tibidabo. The church’s crypt was built between 1902 and 1911 and construction of the upper church began in 1915. Sagnier’s son Josep Maria Sagnier completed the construction in 1961. The original statue of the Sacred Heart on the roof of the church was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The present statue, by Josep Miret, was completed in 1950. In this photo one of Christ’s apostles overlooks Barcelona and the huge communications tower on the next hill.
I understand the Tramvia Blau is presently closed for reconstruction. There is a bus (# 196) that now connects the Metro with the funicular.
Zafon wrote The Shadow of the Wind in 2002. It was translated into English by Lucia Graves in 2009. I came across it in early 2015 and immediately began plans for a trip to Barcelona and we flew to Spain later that year. The second book in the cycle Zafon has named The Cemetery of Forgotten Books is called The Angel’s Game. I read most of that book on the plane and finished it during our stay in Barcelona. It is a prequel to The Shadow of the Wind. I then read the third book in the cycle, The Prisoner of Heaven, shortly after returning from our trip. Lucia Graves, the excellent translator of Zafon’s Spanish works, completed the translation of The Labyrinth of the Spirits in 2019. I didn’t get around to reading it until last year. Then I reread the other three books and enjoyed them considerably. I’ll probably read all of them again someday.
Zafon was born in Barcelona in 1964 and later moved to Los Angeles where he wrote screenplays in English. But he wrote all of his fiction in Spanish. He died of cancer in 2020 at the age of 55.
Most of the actions in The Shadow of the Wind take place in the Bari Gotic and Raval neighborhoods south of Placa de Catalunya. Visitors to Barcelona can sign up for a three-hour literary walking tour that covers these areas. Tibidabo is too far away to be included in this tour, however. We didn’t take the walking tour, but we came across many of Zafon’s landmarks while following a couple of walks that Rick Steves recommends in his Pocket Barcelona.
Tibidabo gets its name from two Latin words: dabo meaning “I will give” and tibi meaning “to you.” For more info on Barcelona’s highest hill see my Crow Canyon Journal blog postings here and here. Better yet, read either an English version of the Bible or St Jerome’s translation into Latin of Matthew 4:09. And then read all four books in The Cemetery of Forgotten Books cycle for the full story of the Semperes, Daniel’s friend Fermin Romero de Torres, and that haunted mansion halfway up Mount Tibidabo.

For me, Barcelona is the city of self-awakening. After my fair share of solo traveling between London, Prague, and Paris, I can passionately say that the connection I had with Barcelona is totally unmatched. It’s the people, it’s the culture, it’s the language (Catalan), it’s the food, it’s the art, it’s every little thing that has made me fall deeply in love with this beautiful Catalan city.
In just one week’s time (or less), you too can experience all that Barcelona has to offer, from its thriving street art scene to all the local cuisines, there is plenty to see in the city that truly never sleeps.
Day 1: My experience at Camp Nou Stadium
To my surprise, I landed in Barcelona at the perfect time! It was the weekend of the La Mercè festival where many people filled the streets for four days in celebration of the Roman Catholic Feast Day of Our Lady. Many celebrations happened all over the main streets of Barcelona where there was live music, various street entertainment, food vendors, and more. Just experiencing this festival was one of the many enriching cultural experiences that I had because I witnessed how one event brought many people together from different walks of life whether they were Catholic or not (the festival is for everyone though).
The day I landed, I made it just in time for the FC Barça vs. Girona FC game which resulted in a tied game (2–2). I can now cross off “seeing Messi score live” of my bucket list :)
Even though I hardly tune into fútbol, I love a good sporting event (after all, I was a sport studies minor in college) and attending a game was just one of the many cultural experiences that I had to undergo. From the collective singing of the FC Barça’s anthem (everyone stands up for this) to hearing the crowd cheer, boo, and shout “Força Barça” it was an unforgettable experience.
Day 2: “Pay What You Can” Walking Tour of Gothic Quarters + Interactive Group Cooking Class
Barcelona is such a huge city with groovy, intimate streets that you might overlook just because you read a post on TripAdvisor about strictly going to X, Y, and Z areas. I am a huge advocate of participating in a group walking tour because it is a great way to get to know the city with the help of a resident! I discovered streets that no one else talked about in other blogs / reviews and the streets that I walked through are perfect for a impromptu photoshoot (shoutout to all the local street artists who make the city even more beautiful). Although the link that I shared above advertises as “free” at the end of all tours the guides ask for a donation because they barely get paid without our help.
And to end my Monday night, I participated in a group cooking class. If you do not mind watching the chef prep and cook the dishes, then I recommend the link above. If you are looking for a more customized cooking class where you have your own hot plate to cook paella and more, then I recommend looking elsewhere. Overall my experience with the cooking class from Viator.com was fun because I got to meet really good people from all over, share stories, and drink sangrias together. All 30 of us at this activity gathered around the large pan to help stir the paella (the interactive part), but in the future I would like to do a smaller cooking class where I can have my own cooking station and follow the instructions of the chef.
Day 3: Sagrada Família + Park Güell
I am still in awe that I got to see Antoni Gaudí ‘s exquisite work! Gaudí was a mastermind architect who designed this beautiful Basílica more than a century ago. Officials say the church is set to be completed in 2026, which is a time I will return to see even more of its beauty. Just witnessing all of the intricate details put me in a place of serenity because no matter what was going on in the world, I felt secure and had peace of mind. I spent approximately 2.5 hours inside while the average person probably only spends an hour or so.
Since I am under 30 years old, I paid 27 euros to go inside the tower, which I highly recommend. The Nativity Tower has the best view because the view faces the beach.
After visiting Sagrada Família, take a short metro ride up to another one of Gaudí works and former residence, Park Güell. Park Güell is one of the best public parks I’ve ever walked through. It has a great combination of shade and sunshine, while also being extremely green because of all the trees, bushes, and cactuses.
The majority of the park is free of charge, but to visit the Gaudí house and the Monumental Core (aka the scene of the colorful benches in Cheetah Girls 2) has a fee. The photo above doesn’t do the park justice! There are so many beautiful designs missing from this photo that you just have to see for yourself when you arrive in Barcelona.
Day 4: Exploring Barceloneta
Along with the rich history and breathtaking scenery, Barcelona is a hot beach city. Sant Sebastià Beach is one of the best parts about Barcelona because there are so many things to do from bike riding to playing a game of volleyball with new friends. At night, the beach becomes even more alive because all of the touristy nightclubs, bars, and restaurants that reside on the end of the beach, making it a perfect night out.
Day 5: City Bus Tour + Picasso Museum
I would have never thought that I would do a “hop on hop off” bus tour ever in my life. There is just so much to see in Barcelona that I gave in to this activity. One of the perks of doing the bus tour is that it comes with a coupon booklet that gives you some good deals for other activities and food places around the city. The only stop that I got off was for the Tibidabo Cathedral del Segrat Cor, which sits at the highest peak in the city, giving viewers amazing 360 views of Barcelona. After the bus tour drops you off, you have to get on the historic Tramvia Blau or 196 red bus (2 minute ride) to the base of Tibidabo, then get on the Tibidabo funicular (7 euros round trip) which is a really cool cable railroad that takes you up the mountain to the Cathedral and mini amusement park. I highly recommend coming here if you have time. The inside of the Cathedral is spectacular as well as the city view.
Since there are many museums in Barcelona, the Picasso Museum is not one to be missed. As of now, it is free entry every Thursday evening. Unfortunately once inside, no photos can be taken of the artwork *sad face* but I can tell you that witnessing the artwork of Pablo Picasso, a phenomenal 20th-century Spanish artist, was a top 5 experience. You can see the passion in all of his work despite the fact that he suffered from imposter syndrome (which is a pretty common experience) and still produced greatness. The exhibit that I witnessed at the end of September was “Picasso and food” along with Impressionist and Symbolist pieces.
If you like Mexican food, I recommend Cantina Mexicana La Hacienda restaurant, which is around the corner from Picasso Museum.
Day 6: Restaurant day around La Rambla + Passeig de Gràcia + Carrer de Blai
La Rambla is a very touristy street in the center of Barcelona that I recommend walking down very attentive of your belongings just because it’s so crowded. One thing to note about La Rambla is to never eat at any of the restaurants on this street because they are usually overpriced and not that great. I came across a fabulous restaurant that was nearby calledLa Fonda (a local resident recommended this place to me), which has a super affordable menu during the lunch hour. I had a 3 course menu for 20 euros! The food was so good that I returned a second time before my departure. The hospitality is unmatched. The host acknowledges you as soon as you walk into the establishment and you are seated right away.
Another restaurant that I recommend is Cerveceria Catalana, which serves delicious tapas! Like most cities in Europe, the best time to eat dinner is after 9pm. Since I arrived solo, I was seated right away at the bar. For groups of two or more, a wait time of one hour should be expected. After checking out all the shops on Passeig de Gràcia, come here for lunch or dinner.
Fortunately enough, my Airbnb was located right on the famous Carrer de Blai, which is a street known for its tapas restaurants. One restaurant that I highly recommend is La Tasqueta de Blai. It’s a laid back eatery that allows you to grab the tapas straight from the bar and at the end you give all your toothpicks to the waiter and pay for your food. Very affordable, each tapas is 1 euro or 1.80 euros.
Notable areas of the city: La Boqueria Market, Montjuïc Fountains at night, Plaça Reial (a nice little square that can be experienced in the afternoon or late at night) I like Kane Roomfor late night cava aka champagne.

My First Love: FC Barcelona
Love has many forms. For some, it’s a person. For others, it’s a moment, a dream, or a place. But for me, love came dressed in red and blue stripes, roaring through the TV screen, dancing on the green fields of the Camp Nou. My first love was not a person—it was FC Barcelona.
I still remember the day it all began. I was barely ten, sitting in my uncle’s living room in Nepal, surrounded by laughter and the buzz of a Champions League night. On the screen, a team moved like poetry. There was elegance, unity, magic. And right at the heart of it all was a little magician—Lionel Messi.
That match changed everything.
It wasn’t just about the goals. It was about the way Barça played. The way Xavi pulled the strings, the way Iniesta glided past defenders like a painter with a brush, the way Messi turned impossible moments into memories. It was like watching art.
From that day on, I was no longer just a boy in Nepal—I was a culé. I read articles, watched every highlight I could find, begged for a jersey with the number 10. I started waking up at 1 or 2 in the morning just to watch La Liga matches live, my eyes sleepy but my heart wide awake.
When we won, I was on top of the world. When we lost, I felt the heartbreak. Every El Clásico became a festival in my house. My room slowly turned into a shrine—posters of Ronaldinho, Messi, and Puyol, stickers of the crest, and scarves with “Més que un club” boldly written across them.
As I grew older, life became more complicated—school, pressure, reality—but Barcelona remained my constant. In the hardest moments, watching Barça play felt like coming home. It reminded me who I was, and who I wanted to be: someone who plays with heart, who stands for something, who never gives up.
I’ve never been to Camp Nou, not yet. But my dream remains. One day, I’ll walk into that stadium, feel the roar of the crowd, and finally see in person what I fell in love with all those years ago on a small TV screen in Nepal.
People ask me why I love a club so far away. I tell them it’s simple: you don’t choose your first love—your heart does. And mine chose FC Barcelona.

FC Barcelona Femení 2024/25 —what have we seen this season?,https://medium.com/@enmlowe/fc-barcelona-femen%C3%AD-2024-25-what-have-we-seen-this-season-2d6480320cf4,"Sign up

Last summer, I published an article taking a comprehensive analytical approach to FC Barcelona Femení’s 2023/24 season by discussing the principles underpinning their attacking play. When the piece was published in July, it was official that then-head coach Jonatan Giráldez would leave the club for a new challenge in the United States. Later in the summer, it was announced that Giráldez would be succeeded by his assistant, Pere Romeu. Given Romeu’s internal promotion, it was reasonable to expect minimal changes, though every coach brings their own ideas that can fully flourish under their leadership.
Over the summer, some squad changes influenced the team’s autumn dynamics: forward/attacking midfielder Mariona Caldentey left for Arsenal, and right-back Lucy Bronze returned to England to join Chelsea. At the same time, prolific striker Ewa Pajor was signed from Wolfsburg, and forward/attacking midfielder Kika Nazareth arrived from Benfica, as forward Salma Paralluelo was sidelined with an injury/playing overload.
Since the start of the season, Barcelona have been remarkably strong in the 2024/25 campaign. In the league, they currently boast 13 consecutive victories with a staggering goal difference of +50, averaging 4.38 goals per match. In the domestic competition, they convincingly defeated their only serious challenger on paper, Real Madrid, who had strengthened their squad significantly over the summer, with a 4–0 away win. However, the Champions League revealed a rare blemish: a 0–2 loss to Manchester City in the group stage opener highlighted defensive vulnerabilities that are harder to detect in league play due to the game dynamics.
Throughout the autumn, I have closely followed Barcelona and watched all their matches. This article builds on my summer analysis of the team’s attacking principles, comparing their style of play this season to last year. All video material referenced is from DAZN or SVT.
As in the summer article, we begin with a statistical review of Barcelona’s autumn to get a comprehensive picture of their season so far. Are there any differences in the data compared to last year? Does anything stand out? Data is sourced from FBref and Opta, last updated on December 16. Visualizations are courtesy of Ben Griffis’ match report site.
Offensive output
When examining offensive output, there is virtually no difference from last season. Notably, the team maintains the same level of goals per match (4.4), while averaging one more shot per match (26.4 to 27.6). Their efficiency remains consistent, with 0.16 goals per shot compared to 0.15 last season and 0.14 npxG per shot compared to 0.13. In some matches, the team’s xG has reached absurd levels; for instance, in the 10–1 win against Granada, their xG was 7.1. For perspective, the highest recorded xG in the Premier League is Liverpool’s 7.3 against Newcastle on January 1, 2024. Unfortunately, I could not find the highest recorded xG figure globally.
Passing statistics
To identify stylistic differences in the data, we can look at passing statistics. Broadly, there is no change in passing accuracy or the total number of successful passes per match (approximately 680 with 86.9% accuracy). However, there is a noticeable increase in the number of short passes per match, rising from 349 to 393, while the number of medium and long passes has decreased. This suggests closer player positioning. Additionally, there has been a decline in passes and crosses into the penalty area, as well as overall switches of play and crosses.
Possession data
Barcelona’s possession has risen to 74.6% this season compared to 71.1% last year, showcasing their dominance in controlling matches. The team’s field tilt — an indicator of territorial dominance — remains at an extraordinary 89%, a full 30 percentage points ahead of second-place Real Madrid.
A related metric, the difference between field tilt and possession, measures how much more possession a team has in the final third compared to the rest of the pitch. Barcelona leads this category with a 15-percentage-point differential, reflecting the unmatched height of their average possession. Their style of play pushes center-backs far up the pitch, underlining the gap in quality between Barcelona and their league opponents, as well as the respect and caution their opponents exhibit when facing them.
Only Lyon in France surpasses Barcelona in combined field tilt-possession metrics across Europe’s top women’s leagues, while Arsenal matches Barcelona’s levels in England. However, neither team matches Barcelona’s extreme possession and field tilt values, as their possession rates hover around 60%.
Barcelona’s Offensive and Defensive Metrics
Barcelona ranks top in every offensive and defensive possession-related category. These include passing, shooting statistics (shots and xG, both from open play and set pieces), and metrics like xT (expected threat), which measures how much a team creates danger through possession. However, there are two categories related to effciency where they do not place themselves top of the league.
Key Statistical Outliers
Efficiency and style
Despite this deliberate approach, Barcelona scores the most goals in the league by far and boasts a +7.3 goal difference above their xG, a testament to their superior finishing and decision-making. This strategy leverages the squad’s collective intelligence and ability to assess scoring opportunities. The outcome? A high-efficiency attacking style that capitalizes on possession dominance, excellent decision-making, and the technical superiority of their players.
Defensive issues exposed against Manchester City
As briefly mentioned in the introduction, Barca has one blemish on their record, when they lost 2–0 to Manchester City away in the first round of the Champions League group stage. The match was played in early October, with Barca riding a streak of five straight wins against league opposition that they had brushed aside with ease. This was thus the first real test of the season. The match exposed what could actually be called a slack or naïve approach from Barcelona to their defensive game. It demonstrated how a team playing with patience and sometimes speed in their build-up play, and daring to play threatening balls between and over the lines, could realistically challenge Barcelona. City managed to exploit a nonchalant Barcelona team that mistimed their pressing and at times didn’t even show intentions to defend against their opponents with the intensity required against a top-tier City side, featuring players like Lauren Hemp, Khadija Shaw, Vivianne Miedema, and Jess Park. Let’s look at some examples.
Here, Manchester City succeeded by exploiting three factors:
Key (creative) players at fault for this included Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas, and Patri Guijarro, which led to others like Keira Walsh, Mapi León and Esmeé Brugts having to compensate, affecting the defensive structure and the spaces left behind in their defensive play. These points can partially be boiled down to a question of the players’ attitude toward the defensive work required but also to the team’s approach to risk aversion in their play.
Pressing in league play, and naïve buildup from opponents
In the league, they are used to taking greater risks, as they are so dominant that conceding a goal here or there due to a ball behind a high line or attackers sprinting past an undermanned rest defense doesn’t matter, since they still average 4.38 goals per match. For instance, they often dare to push their center-backs into the final third (which is the main reason they have such an extreme field tilt), and they prefer to keep their attacking forces higher up the pitch after losing the ball to maximize their impact when regaining possession, compared to a more deliberate rest-defense perspective. As a result, they’ve conceded occasional goals in league matches, having kept just six clean sheets in 13 games. However, in the Champions League opener, Barca showed no clear signs of modifying their game plan toward greater risk aversion against stronger opposition.
In the return match against Manchester City at home, they had identified the problem and approached the game out of possession much more aggressively. They chose a man-marking-based approach to their pressing, a method increasingly common in European football at the time, and implemented it right from the start. With the required intensity, they managed to completely smother City, limiting them to just three shots for a total of 0.2 xG, compared to 13 shots and 1.6 xG in the opening round. Let’s look at a clip of how this could play out.
The ever-recurring tactical question regarding the man-marking approach to defending without the ball is how long a team can sustain the required intensity when facing strong opponents with players technically skilled enough to handle such marking pressure. If you try to defend with such intensity while also maintaining a high tempo in possession, energy levels can drop quickly. Therefore, teams must either change their defensive approach later in the game by lowering the tempo and focusing more on covering spaces or slow down their own tempo in possession. In my view, this depends on the specific game plan, as the importance of certain defensive elements will largely depend on the opponent’s skill in possession.
Barca realized after the first match (although they should have seen this in the opponent analysis before the first game) that City were technically skilled enough to hurt them in their possession play. As a result, they opted for an intense approach in defending without the ball and slowed their possession tempo just enough to sustain the defensive intensity for about 80 minutes, which was sufficient. They returned to their “normal” levels of 74% possession and, in this match, 850 passes, where short passing sequences after ball recoveries were key to calming the tempo and gaining the control of the match they never had in Manchester. Leading 3–0 with ten minutes left, they slowed the pace somewhat, where two of City’s three shots came in the last ten minutes. In this match, they were thus skilled in the crucial tactical balance of tempo.
In the league, we often see teams trying to play out from the goalkeeper in their build-up. In this phase of pressing, Barca usually shows great discipline (it’s sometimes in certain transitional moments defensively that certain players may lack this) and are very skilled at shutting down their opponents with a form of hybrid press, which I consider more marking-oriented but still with elements of players in hybrid roles. We see an example in the match against Real Betis.
After watching several Liga F matches where the same patterns can be discerned match after match — where Barcelona’s opponents attempt to build from the goalkeeper but are quickly stopped, leading to a rather destructive effect in transitions — I am increasingly struggling to understand why opponents’ game plans continue to emphasize this approach. Even if it aligns with their principles, I still find it difficult to grasp why opponents persist in this way when it so often actively works against them when facing Barcelona.
The conclusion from my first article about Barcelona was that I viewed them as a team that values principles over structures. In the final section of the article, I reflected on how these principles borrow elements primarily associated with positional play but also principles tied to discussions around relational play. Most principles from last season remain intact, although some have evolved further. An example is evident in the statistics showing an increase in shorter passes, a consequence of closer player proximity. Barcelona often overload the left side in what, in relational play terminology, is frequently referred to as a “tilt.” You’ll often see a “right-back” like Ona Batlle coming centrally into the pitch, with “six” Keira Walsh moving wide to join her teammates, and winger Caroline Graham Hansen typically maintaining width — a feature they value for creating an outlet.
However, just because a team plays with a clear tilt doesn’t mean it adheres to “relational play.” A team fully embracing relational principles works clearly with inside diagonals and concepts like tabelas, escadinhas, and corta luz. When these movement-based principles aren’t utilized — either due to limited understanding among players of each other’s movements and intentions or because a coach doesn’t sufficiently encourage them — such overloads can become static and ineffective. Defending teams can then fairly easily contain attacks in their defensive third without conceding threatening shots.
How can a tilt look?
In the clip below, we see a relatively static tilt on the left side. However, note in particular how the players position themselves relative to the (fairly small) spaces created on that side but at angles that allow them to receive passes and maintain progression. They constantly adapt to spaces created in the opponent’s defensive structure.
We also see an example of an attack in the final third through an inside diagonal.
In these moments of attacking play, Barcelona have successfully combined forward movements out of a tilt with varying effectiveness depending on the match. How well this works largely depends on which players are on the pitch and who participates in the tilt.
In a video analysis of Barcelona’s men’s team by the YouTube channel The Purist, three qualities were identified in players that make their attacking play so threatening:
A Master at Delivering to Space, a Creative Combination Player, and a Game Breaker
When Alexia Putellas was absent from the team during a period from late November to mid-December, her decisive role as a creative combination player became evident. This was especially noticeable in the league match against Valencia. She served as a crucial link in the left-side tilt, making short-passing sequences effective in breaking down defensive structures by doing what defenders seldom expected. Together with Aitana Bonmatí, they form a sharp and unpredictable duo capable of creative combinations. Alexia often initiates the unpredictable action — whether it’s a backheel, a no-look pass, or participating in a tabela — while Aitana interprets it by either attacking the space where the ball lands or extending the play to the next player in a threatening position.
We see this in the clip below, where Claudia Pina receives the ball from Alexia, and Aitana finishes.
This isn’t to say other players cannot combine creatively, but based on watching Barcelona with and without Alexia, I’ve observed that these combinations emerge more naturally with her as the link. In many other cases, it has taken several attempts before players fully understood each other’s intentions.
Here’s an example where left-sided winger Esmeé Brugts looks to play a one-two but Aitana doesn’t grasp her intent.
Later, we see another instance where the situation is right, and Patri understands what Brugts wants to do. Shortly after, Claudia Pina breaks the deadlock in the match.
Something else that characterizes Barcelona is how frequently they use inside diagonals to attack the box, much like The Purist highlighted in their analysis of the men’s team’s approach in the final third. In many matches, Barcelona rarely appears restricted by a structure or framework-based ideas when attacking the box.
A significant advantage Barcelona gains when executing a tilt is the opposition’s need to respond to the overload, the rotations and movements within it. As noted earlier, Keira Walsh, playing as a “six,” is often directly involved in a tilt rather than serving as a traditional central balance player when attacking the penalty area. If Walsh draws a defender, it allows Barcelona’s opposite “ten,” who is usually positioned more centrally but can shift outward if an outlet is needed, to almost always be free for a switch of play. Walsh also enjoys rotating with her midfield colleagues, who in turn attack the space she vacates. This forces the opponents to shift further if they want to keep up. In this way, Barcelona can confuse defending teams, who suddenly don’t know whom to press.
A clear example of this can be seen in a clip where Walsh (#21) makes a run into an open space on the right side. Manchester City’s Yui Hasegawa (#25), initially responsible for Aitana Bonmatí (#14), must now contend with both Walsh and Aitana. Hasegawa eventually tracks Walsh, leaving Aitana free to receive the ball and play it forward. Barcelona then breaks the press with successive third-player combinations, culminating in Patri finding the perfect angle and delivering a sublime cross-field pass to Salma Paralluelo.
Since Barcelona’s tilt often occurs on the left side, switches of play frequently target the right side. And on that side, we find Barcelona’s most prominent “game breaker” — Caroline Graham Hansen. Her ability to challenge defenders one-on-one, both inside and outside, makes her a formidable weapon. Leading the Spanish league in expected assists (xA) and shot assists, she is crucial to Barcelona’s offensive dynamism. Even in matches where Barcelona slows the tempo with the ball, Graham Hansen can suddenly break away from her marker, drive into the box, and deliver a ball into the most dangerous areas.
We’ve discussed how Barcelona often utilizes tilts in the final third, diagonal attacks into the penalty area through penetrating passes, and creative combinations when the “right” players understand each other. These are examples of relational tendencies in their attacking play. However, when it comes to buildup play — or what might more accurately be called possession establishment — things can look different. In league play, “buildup” from the goalkeeper or deep in the defensive line rarely occurs, as opponents seldom choose to press Barcelona. They know that Barcelona’s players are too technically skilled; any minor error in the press will allow them to bypass it in an instant. Instead, opponents often adopt a compact shape as soon as they lose the ball.
Last season, we saw a Barcelona side that frequently resolved such situations in diverse ways depending on the game’s immediate state, but with clear principles like third-player combinations and overloads in tight spaces — even in their own half. Interesting tactics included forwards dropping deep (as Mariona Caldentey often did), rotations that drew defenders and opened spaces for diagonal progression during the establishment phase, and movements that seemed to create artificial transitions in the game.
In another article, I attempted to define a concept for what Barcelona executed in this part of their play, which I called adaptationism. The term was used to describe how teams use principles to continuously adapt to the game’s immediate state, considering space, ball position, and the positions of opponents and teammates. This occurs regardless of whether one adheres to relational, positional, or a hybrid approach — or perhaps none of these at all.
Barcelona’s evolving possession “structures”
This season, Pere Romeu has chosen to implement clearer structures during the establishment phase in certain matches. This could partly be due to Romeu’s autonomy as a coach but also due to the specific player resources available to him. One notable example is Mapi León, who returned from an injury spell last year and has become the team’s top performer in passes into the final third and progressive passes. León often operates from an advanced position as a left center-back, with Irene Paredes covering behind her. With León’s exceptional passing ability, Barcelona have been able to deploy other players in more advanced roles during attacks.
For instance, Claudia Pina has played much more as a forward this season than last, where she primarily served as a central midfielder. Pina is a player who often doesn’t get the credit she deserves, overshadowed by her high-profile teammates. Statistically, she ranked higher than both Aitana Bonmatí and Patri Guijarro last season, even as Alexia Putellas was out injured during certain periods. Pina also had the most minutes on the pitch last year and is equally indispensable this season.
In one clip, we see Barcelona patiently lure the opponent’s midfield into pressing by baiting them. When they bite, space opens up, allowing Pina to attack it and flick the ball forward to striker Ewa Pajor. Simultaneously, Aitana Bonmatí recognizes the situation and makes a decisive run, setting herself up for a clear scoring opportunity that she later converts.
Structural variations in the establishment phase
During the establishment phase, Barcelona frequently employs the 3–2–5 structure commonly associated with positional play. Occasionally, they use what resembles a three-back formation with a “six” operating fluidly just above, while the “rest” of the team positions themselves slightly further upfield. While this might look like a 3–1–6 numerically, it doesn’t entirely reflect the practical dynamics on the pitch.
In one sequence, Barcelona demonstrates patience, waiting to see if Manchester City will press their central double pivot. However, City opts for a compact shape to block central progression. This narrow defensive setup leaves more space and time for Barcelona to exploit the flanks and maintain their attacking momentum. Mapi León’s progressive passing comes to the fore, as does Esmeé Brugts’ deep ball to Ewa Pajor.
In another example, Barcelona plays with a three-back setup and a “six” during possession establishment, positioning players between the opposition’s defensive lines to disrupt a compact 4–4–2 or 5–3–2. Initially, patience in the backline is key. Then comes horizontal stretching of the defense, followed by a switch of play to create larger spaces on the opposite side. Barcelona advances through shorter passes and carries, culminating in another switch of play. Notably, Aitana continues her run into the assist zone, accompanied by multiple players attacking the penalty area.
Blending football philosophies
These examples illustrate how Barcelona employs principles from various football philosophies in different phases of their attacking play:
Barcelona’s rotations are not confined to a predefined structure but rather aim to influence both their own shape and the opponent’s defensive organization. This interplay of ideas from multiple football ideologies makes it difficult to assign a single philosophical label to the team.
FC Barcelona Femení as a Case Study
The blending of concepts from different football philosophies and their interaction within individual matches — as well as forming the foundation of an entire team strategy — is a fascinating subject. In this regard, FC Barcelona Femení serves as an intriguing case study. Their tactical versatility and innovative approach challenge conventional categorizations, making them a standout example of modern football’s evolving complexity.

For almost a decade, Barcelona was the football club of the purist. Led by its unassuming superstars, the team was hailed not just for its sporting achievements, but its artistry. It was an era of talent, technical elegance, and complete reverence for the football.
Those days are long gone.
You can trace the metamorphosis back several years. Perhaps as far back as the days of Luis Enrique, whose reign saw an emergence of direct football, spearheaded by MSN; Messi, Suárez and Neymar. Under subsequent managers we saw variations on the theme. Ernesto Valverde’s team took on a rugged, pragmatic demeanour. Quique Setién, trying to reverse the trend, only created confusion and contradiction.
But it wasn’t until Ronald Koeman arrived, and Lionel Messi departed, that the flame was truly extinguished.
Barcelona were at home to Granada. 1–0 down in the 82nd minute, accompanied by whistles from the outraged Camp Nou, the Dutch manager pioneered his own forward trident: Gerard Piqué, Ronald Araújo and Luuk de Jong. The ball was flung hopefully into the box, and Barca’s goliaths did whatever it took to bludgeon the ball into the net.
The purists wept. Their club was unrecognisable.
The Ronald Koeman era is over, but the scars remain. On Sunday, against Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona attempted a ludicrous 40 crosses, and ended the game with a front line of Luuk de Jong and Ronald Araújo. Ironically, this happened under the stewardship of the crown prince of ‘tiki taka’ himself, Xavi Hernández.
How did it come to this?
Perhaps there’s method to this madness, or more likely, it’s a symptom of the team’s serious deficiencies. To shed light, let’s examine Xavi’s rebuild project and identify why exactly this is happening, and what the alternatives might be going forward.
Let’s start with the diagnosis.
Forget about ‘tiki taka’ for a moment, or any other fabricated label. Xavi’s goal as Barcelona coach is to reintroduce positional play. A philosophy developed chiefly by Johan Cruyff. It’s a cerebral way of seeing the game, based on angles and distances between players, creation of triangles, instinctive movement. Cruyff claims it took ‘10,000 hours of training to finally reach the level of the Dream Team’. Mastery takes years.
We are seeing only the genesis of Xavi’s version, but it’s clear already that he wants to be a little more expansive than his predecessors. More switches of play, more direct passes, more crosses. As long as the space and movement allows it.
Xavi wants to stretch the opposition and exploit space quickly. To punish teams that stay compact by attacking the wide areas. It has worked. Barca have scored 57 goals in 32 games. Astonishingly, 40% of those open play goals have come from wide crosses.
So what’s the problem? Well, scoring from wide positions is one thing. When Barca have the game under control, there are signs they are acclimatising to the new philosophy. The faults appear when they are losing. When the opponents defend stubbornly and the clock is ticking down.
This is the recipe for a different type of crossing game. One that abandons positional play and ball circulation for low-percentage, high-volume balls into the box. This isn’t a considered approach. It’s a knee-jerk reaction. A response from a team, and a coach, that has no solution to a problem. And it happens for three reasons:
1. Opponents defend deep, with numbers
In each of Barca’s last three defeats, the opponent has finished the game with the same system: 5–4–1. They defend deep, in numbers, with very little space between the lines.
It is the kryptonite for any possession-based team. A nightmare to break down.
Pep Guardiola, another Cruyff disciple from whom Xavi has taken a lot of inspiration, has spent much of his career facing such dilemmas. It took years for him to develop a blueprint. Working from scratch, with an inherited squad, Xavi hasn’t cracked the code. Not yet.
2. Barca’s attack is one dimensional
In this first edition of ‘XaviBall’, Barcelona attack almost entirely down the flanks. Combinations through the centre are limited, largely because of the positions of attacking midfielders (the ‘interiors’). Rather than patrolling the centre, Barca’s interiors stay high and wide. Pedri and Frenkie de Jong are typically closer to the centre forward than they are to the pivot, Sergio Busquets.
Unfortunately, when the opponents nullify Barca’s width, they do not have a practiced alternative. Instead of looking for space in other areas, they double down on the wings, usually with the arrival of Adama Traoré. And the cycle of crossing begins.
3. The squad is limited
None of this is entirely Xavi’s fault. Take a look at the squad and you realise it’s missing a few crown jewels. Centre forward is a particularly barren. While Aubameyang is an excellent goal scorer, he is no creator. His impotence during buildup seriously limits Barca’s attack. Aubameyang has, time after time, lost the ball when it goes into his feet. Attacking through the middle becomes futile.
What the squad does have is two very direct, very effective crossing wingers: Ousmane Dembélé and Adama Traoré. It also has two imperious aerial threats, Luuk de Jong and centre back Ronald Araújo.
Together, these are the ingredients for ‘cross and hope’. Stubborn opponents, no ‘Plan B’ and a deficient squad.
The question for Xavi is obvious. What changes next season?
The solutions to these problems are not easy. But they are simple. Do these three things, and the demons of desperation will be exorcised for good. They are:
Solution 1: Prepare the team more thoroughly for deep, compact defences.
This requires time, patience and above all maturity. To some players it might seem counter-intuitive to take an extra touch, or look for an extra pass, rather than throw the ball into a dangerous area. But composure is crucial, and it has to be learned.
Solution 2: Improve the squad in key positions.
Particularly with a centre forward who can bring another dimension to Barca’s attack. Right back will also be important, to reduce reliance on Dembélé (should he stay) on that side.
Solution 3: Take the emphasis away from winning, and focus on performance.
This might sound controversial. But it’s the mentality that separates Xavi, a relative rookie, from a veteran like Pep Guardiola. Xavi’s language is ‘must-win’. Guardiola says ‘we play our game’. When you take away the pressure of the final result, and focus on executing your game plan, you develop a culture that’s resilient to wins or losses. One that doesn’t rush, or become desperate. You create the conditions for a long-term successful project.
With Xavi’s tenure still in its infancy, and some important transfer windows on the horizon, much can change in the near future for Barcelona. Only months ago this was a sinking ship; now some holes have been plugged. It’s going to take a lot more hard work, and disappointing performances, before we set course for something special. We’re nowhere near Cruyff’s 10,000 hours.
Regardless of a few deficiencies, or blind spots in the system, this is a project that demands time and support.
Given both of those things, the purists will return. And Barcelona will be recognisable again.
Thanks for reading, be sure to leave a ‘clap’ if you enjoyed, so I can keep making more Barcelona content!

Barcelona conquered my heart 12 years ago. Since then I have known no other city that enchants me so much. She keeps her memories in the Gothic Quarter and Old Town, and exquisitely dresses up in the architecture of the Eixample.
I recall the words of one taxi driver in Valencia who, with a sigh of complaint, noted that his native city turned its back on the sea, while Barcelona faces the sea flirtatiously. Those who have been there can see the driver’s point.
Indeed, Barcelona was born under a lucky star. It started its growth from the seashore and developed as a port city. The sea predetermined not only its urban development, but also the spirit of Ciudad Condal — a free city, the seat of a county unto itself. It is artistic, independent and constantly changing.
Barcelona consistently irritated Francisco Franco, who espoused centralism and linguistic unification. The burden of dictatorship that constrained Catalan cultural self-identification and sidelined their ancestors’ language amounted to a straitjacket on Catalan identity. Once free, Catalonia erupted in national pride, gained autonomy and enacted widespread use of the Catalan language. Today, picking out a book in Spanish (Castellano) in a Barcelona bookstore can become a dizzying challenge for the eyes.
If you’ve been to Barcelona, you can’t fail to notice red-and-yellow Catalan flags hanging from some balconies, or black stickers with a donkey adjusted to a car bumper. These are the signs of Catalan self-identification. A driver from Madrid, on the other hand, would festoon his car with a sticker of an Osborne bull. This is the animal that witnessed a passionate coitus between Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz in the explicit movie Jamón, Jamón.
The relationship between Madrid and Barcelona reminds me of the relationship between Moscow and St Petersburg. There is an intrinsic rivalry between the two cities, which can be compared in terms of size, grandeur and cultural imprint.
Still, in my mind’s eye there is no place for competition between Madrid and Barcelona because I tend to view them as cities of the opposite sex. Barcelona sounds like a woman’s name and its architectural lines embody femininity; whereas Madrid manifests itself as a king and has a male energy. Would it not be laughable for a man and a woman to compare assets?
However, nobody would deny that it was not Madrid, but Barcelona that in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was a wellspring of artistic, bohemian and eccentric lifestyle in Spain. The Catalan capital was greatly influenced by Paris. In 1989 the Parallel avenue became famous for its own Moulin Rouge, the El Molino music hall. Another Parisian-like venue was a famous café, Els Cuatre Gats at carrer Montsió 3. It was opened by Pere Romeo, who had previously worked as a waiter and an entertainer in the cabaret Le Chat Noir in Paris. He timely sensed that Barcelona was lacking a tavern with affordably priced food and sounds of a piano. This place was bound to become legendary. The upper crust of the artistic world, namely Santiago Rusiñol, Ramón Casas, Pablo Picasso and Antonio Gaudí held their vibrant round tables there.
Els Cuatre Gats is still up and running. If you are willing to travel back to the early 20th century and see a place where creative ideas were born, you should definitely pin this café on your map.
To help you understand what makes me feel enchanted by Barcelona, I would like to share some of my favourite routes and spots. In my recommendations I will deliberately skip some of the most revered tourist locations.
To start with, I must confess that I loathe La Rambla. The reason is simple. It is overcrowded and has a precarious feel. If you are up for a long straight walk, instead of going down La Rambla toward the sea, turn around and head up the Rambla de Cataluña. This long boulevard is wrongly ignored by the touristic herds, who prefer to ransack numerous shops on Paseo de Gracia rather than peacefully explore the streets inhabited by genuine Catalans. You can see the essence of Barcelona life along the Rambla de Cataluña. There are families with strollers passing by, senior gray-haired couples sitting on the benches, loud groups of friends drinking cañas or eating tapas in the street cafes.
Merging with locals doesn’t exclude the opportunity to do some shopping. Don’t miss Muji, Jo Malone or Zara Home. But the foremost highlight of this boulevard is the elegant architecture of the buildings. Be ready to have a sore neck as you will constantly feel the need to look upward. Soon enough, your long walk will be rewarded with an imposing view of Tibidabo mountain. This name comes from the Latin, meaning “I will give to you”. These were the words that the Devil said to Jesus Christ, trying to tempt Him in the desert with all the riches of the world — and what greater riches could there be, one should think, than the seducing skyline of Barcelona?
Our Savior turned down the diabolical offering. But we, trespassers and sinners, should not refrain from enjoying the breathtaking view of the city. And we should also visit the Temple of the Sacred Heart atop Tibidabo, crowned with a monumental figure of Jesus Christ.
Due to its distance from the city center, Tibidabo is not considered as a main attraction. But I would strongly recommend you to take a bus or a taxi and see the beauty of Barcelona from here, almost from Heaven. I will concede, of course, that Sagrada Familia is a masterpiece beyond human conception, where you will witness a triumph of life, but here in the Temple of the Sacred Heart you will get all that plus a unique feeling of hovering over the city.
In order to feel Barcelona’s heart beating, one should go to Diagonal. Despite its proximity to Paseo de Gracia, this long and important artery is almost free from tourists. Instead of casually dressed foreigners you will see business-like, formally dressed Catalans, who hurriedly park their Vespas along the road and rush to their offices.
As a driver, I prefer to avoid this avenue because of the traffic and frequency of traffic lights, but as a pedestrian, I value this street a lot. I love its architectural attire: the splendid façades and ascending perpendicular streets, Muntaner and Aribau, which lead to Vía Augusta. These streets shape one of the city’s most affluent neighborhoods — Sant Gervasi. Its residents are doctors, professors, lawyers and businessmen. You can see them during their morning walks with their dogs in the tiny lovely Parc Turó or in the nearby cafes enjoying a café cortado or café solo and reading El Periódico on the weekends.
If you are hungry and tempted to try traditional tapas, I know a place that you would like. Cervercería Catalana reflects the easygoing nature of Barcelona — it takes good care of its visitors, but not at the expense of the locals, so be ready to rub elbows with the white collars who come here for lunch. If you choose to munch between 13.30 and 15, you will have to wait for approx. 15 minutes to be seated. But if you come alone, don’t miss the chance to get a place at the bar. Apart from the so-much-talked-about tapas you will face an abundance of fresh seafood and seasonal vegetables on the counter. Don’t be shy, point your finger at whatever raw ingredient you find attractive and in 5–10 minutes you will have it, cooked in the Spanish way. Take advantage of the menu of the day. During the weekdays it includes rice of the day (arroz del día). If you come in good company, bear in mind the Spanish tradition of sharing food, when all the plates with different tapas are placed in the middle of the table. This custom (para compartir) is not only generous but also very useful, as you are allowed to indulge in a symphony of various flavours.
Speaking of tapas, here is an interesting fact. Nowadays it is not a common sight, but 10 years ago you could rate the quality of a bar by the quantity of crumpled napkins thrown under the bar counter. Imagine yourself drinking a glass of wine or a pint of beer, savouring morsels of tapas, wiping your fingers with napkins and throwing them down. For a passerby, a floor covered with paper would be the best advertising campaign.
In tapas bars I prefer to skip the deserts and treat myself to un carajillo con Baileys — a small glass of coffee with Bailey’s Irish Cream. Let me end Part I on that sweet note…

Originally published on alexrawlings.co.uk
It was a very simple move. A short, 90 minute hop across the length of France, down over the Pyrenees, and into my new home. Into Barcelona.
I had tried to throw almost everything away. I’d spent the week before the big day hauling huge bags of old clothes, books, unused kitchen equipment and anything that could weigh me down out to the recycling centre. I’d narrowed my life down to just two suitcases and the iMac I’d bought in Budapest. That was everything I packed onto that small plane that morning and brought with me into my new life.
There was nobody to greet me as I walked out of arrivals pushing my trolley. A sea of strangers, waiting for friends and relatives. I walked past them, pushing my life on a single trolley, and headed for the taxi rank.
I made my way to the front of the queue and greeted the taxi driver in Spanish.
“Hola, buenas.” I pointed at my bags. “Te pido disculpas, porque llevo toda mi vida aquí, y tendremos que ponerla toda en tu coche. You’ll have to forgive me, because I have my whole life with me here, and we’re going to have to fit all of it in your taxi.”
“Buenas,” he replied. “Eso es toda tu vida? Qué guay. Qué honor. Pues la ponemos por detrás. This is your whole life? Wow. What an honour. Let’s put it all in the boot.”
We drove off along the motorway towards the city over the turquoise horizon. The taxi driver was keen to talk. He asked me if I had so many things with me because I was moving to Barcelona. I told him I was. He asked me what I was going to do here. I coughed.
This was the question that I’d spent so long trying to avoid answering. The fact was I didn’t really have a clear idea. I had dreams, I had some plans, I had some projects, and I’d come to Barcelona because I thought this would finally be the place where I could get to work on them.
Because how do you tell somebody that one day you just woke up and knew you had to go? That you went into work and sat down with your manager and gave her your notice? You put your room up for rent, closed your bank accounts, and booked a one way ticket. Then a few weeks later, you just went.
No, you didn’t know what you were going to. But you knew that you’d never felt any urge as strong as this ever before in your life, and so for the very first time you stopped listening to everybody else, and started listening to yourself. And because you’d done that, you knew everything would be alright.
“I’m a journalist,” I told him. “I write feature pieces about languages, cultures and intercultural communication.” That’s what I’d told the BA cabin crew at Heathrow that morning when I was trying to persuade them to let me take my iMac into the cabin with me. It had worked.
The driver wasn’t really interested, because what he really wanted to talk about was chestnuts. Chestnuts, he told me, were an important symbol for life. They reconnected us with nature, with fate, and they brought us luck.
He grew chestnuts, he told me, but not just any chestnuts, lucky chestnuts: castañas de la suerte. He told me that whenever I needed some luck or inspiration, I should just take one of his chestnuts into my hand and squeeze it tight, and that fate would smile upon me.
As he started listing all the Spanish celebrities I’d never heard of who’d been in his taxi and held his chestnuts, I thought that was exactly what I needed at this point in my life: a bit of luck.
I looked at his measly chestnuts in their cheap cardboard boxes. I knew it was a scam, but I decided I was going to buy one anyway.
Soon, the motorway gave way to the elegant, multicoloured avenues of Barcelona. The billboards that had been offering to fly me back to London for €19,99 had turned into wrought iron balconies, draped with Catalan independence flags and yellow ribbons.
The afternoon sun began to dance through the autumnal leaves of the trees that lined the street. I suddenly realised that the driver had stopped talking about chestnuts.
“I’m very Catalan,” he said. “I love my country, I love my language, and I love my people.” As we drew up to a red light, he turned around to face me. “Pero yo no me muero por ninguna bandera. But I’m not going to die for any flag.” He let that hang for a moment in the air.
The lights turned green and we drove on, past another sea of Catalan flags. Each one seemed bigger, longer, and stripier than the last.
I told him, in Catalan, that I wanted to learn better Catalan. This delighted him, and he immediately stopped speaking Spanish.
“Everyone who lives in Barcelona should learn Catalan”, he told me. “Everyone complains that Catalans are very reclusive and hard to get to know, but how on earth do people coming here expect to integrate if they won’t even learn our language?”
“Lots of foreigners come here to learn Spanish and then complain that everything is written in our language. There are so many cities in the world that speak Spanish, and just one that speaks Catalan. Why do they come here? If they don’t like it here, why don’t they go to Toledo or Valladolid or somewhere else?”
Because they don’t really come here to learn Spanish or Catalan, I thought. They come here primarily for the beach. There’s no beach in Toledo.
Eventually we arrived. My new front door was a gigantic glass and iron structure that gushed with natural light from the busy street into the ornate entranceway of my building.
I told the driver I wanted to buy a chestnut. His face looked like Catalunya had just been given independence and granted a permanent seat on the UN Security Council all in the same afternoon.
He helped me lift my possessions out onto the street, and plonked my largest suitcase directly into the path of a passing hipster with perfect designer stubble. He stumbled over it. “Welcome, tourist,” he muttered in English.
I started looking for the right doorbell to ring when suddenly the door was opened by a tall, thin guy with curly black hair and an Argentinian accent. I realised this was the person who was in the process of moving out of the room I was moving into. He had some bad news.
“El ascensor no va. Tendrás que subir las escaleras. The lift is out. You’re going to have to take the stairs.”
It was almost a very simple move. But even the slog of lifting 65 kilos worth of possessions up five flights of stairs was made beautiful by the ornate tiles that lined every step of the way.
As I collapsed into the sofa of my new living room and enjoyed the final rays of sunlight of the afternoon streaming through the double balcony doors, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I had done it. I live in Barcelona now. And I couldn’t be happier.

From a small town of Jharkhand to an international tourist spot, home of “FC Barcelona”. A Solo travel to foreign land to end up meeting lovely people and finding soul brothers. It was an amazing time that I spent in Spain. Hence to give my respect and acknowledgment to everyone who was part of my travel is my responsibility, hence I am writing this article.
This was an important event in my life as I had always wanted that my first international travel would have some meaning to it and not just a recreational event. Hence, I was thrilled when I first new about the travel. My wife can tell you about the excitement I had the day I told her.
I am breaking this article in following parts.
Requesting the travel
Like every regular Tuesday, I was with my Boss for the weekly update. While I was giving the updates, we focused on the team we ramped up in BCN. It was about 8 months and we were seeing great results; however, I expressed the concern of not being able to connect with them at the level I do with my team here in India. Even though we used all modern method to meet and try to connect, there was always hit and miss and that kept me thirsty.
Suddenly I heard — “You should go meet them” I did not understand it at first and then he said it will be good if you visit the BCN office and meet the guys. Well! my soul was jumping and dancing but outside I kept the composure and said, Sure.
Passport and the Visa
Now you will know the reason, why I kept a separate section dedicated to Passport and visa. My passport had expired in 2016. I never got the urge to renew it just to use it as an ID for taking loan or filling any form. However, I had made a resolution at the beginning of 2019 that I will get my passport renewed. Hence, I applied for renewal, booked a slot, went to passport office. After step 2 I was sent to meet the passport office manager, she abruptly asked me for my educational certificate. I asked why, she said go write an application that you don’t need a passport showing you are educated, I was shocked — what? I asked. She responded your old passport is of type — “ECR category” and while renewing it if you don’t submit your 10th certificate we will issue the same. I did not know a thing about it. However, I read and found I would never get work visa for any country. Hence, I took another slot and went again, and all was okay.
I received my passport but my police verification was not yet done, so the dude turns up to my house and asks for all kinds of documents and as soon as he sees my old passport was from Jharkhand, He immediately asked for even more documentation — I showed him the new passport too, that I have received it. Unfortunately, my police verification failed.
After I raised and escalation, I received a call from passport office to whom I explained everything, but the person was supposedly trained to give time slot and he did that perfectly- only thing he forgot to tell that I was not supposed to go to same visa office but to the regional head office. Anyways the security guard at the passport office told me that I was in wrong place and hence I reached the regional passport office and after being in the queue got to meet the passport officer. After I explained her everything, she showed that she was upset with the “dude” but then smiled and said the “dude” wants to verify your nationality. Thanks to my call center background I almost uttered “WTF”. I was expecting that she would reject the “dude’s” rejection and approve my passport however she sent my application for police verification again. I smiled at her and said, that same “dude” will come to verify, and she said it’s the process.
That’s the time when I googled how to bribe someone.
Finally, I had passport successfully approved by police. Yay! And my boss just told me to go international…
For couple of days I was just thinking and then I spoke with a colleague cum friend cum mentor about it, the next min I got the details of whom to contact for tickets and an introductory email to Visa agency.
Went through the visa agency as it was my first experience and did not want to get bounced around, we picked up a date and booked the tickets. Collected all the documents and prepared my application. Took an appointment for visa document submission and went.
I was before time and the office was empty — only the security guard and the application collector but he is a guy of ethics and made me wait till my slot time came. Then I was called and asked for my documents. Looking at those properly listed documents, he rejected it and gave me a new list of documents. Supposedly they needed 1 year of bank statement and 6 months of salary slip and many more for a 7 days visa. I was taken aback, he gave me another slot and I could not make it in that time. I went the next day and he was furious as to how can I simply walk in. lol the office was very busy with me, the guard and him. Still he called me the next day — I had to.
To my surprise before the 7th day EOB, I got my passport with an approved visa on it.
The Flight
My Flight was in morning to Dubai and then to Barcelona. I reached airport early and checked in, bought a book, eat breakfast and finally acted reading!
The gates opened and I boarded the flight, Woah! Emirates is awesome that’s the voice I heard within me. Reached my seat and settled. Watched movies and when the hostess came, I denied the food only to realize that it was free (already paid for). Well there’s the second flight to compensate! Ting…
I reached Dubai, Connections this way please, connections this way please… If ever I will have memory flashes like Jason Bourne, I am sure this would be part of it… The red connection boards, everyone walking fast and different faces. Kept pace and suddenly a gate opened I was hurried in a bus. I reached next gate and funny thing happened with me. I had two extra hours in between but the time difference confused me and the display boards.
The display boards in Dubai airport has an extra column, it’s the last column that tells you how many min it will take for you to reach the gate from the place where the board is. With so much of hustle and time difference playing at the back of my mind, I thought that column was for the time the flight goes and it showed 6 mins for my flight. Again, I said “WTF” and ran, don’t judge right now… I had to.
I reached the gate, it was closed. Damn! Not a single “May I help you” but many shops. Okay I said to myself and went to the restroom as it was more urgent than missing the flight. After I was done and was relaxed, I guess the brain started functioning and I realized that I have almost two hours before the flight goes. Then I was like why it would say 6 min on the board and then I looked at the closest display board and it said 2 min. Now I knew the reason why they have added the extra column.
Now mind at peace I sat near the gate and as the boarding started, I joined the queue and Holy mother of god what is this, a flight or a hotel! Emirates is super awesome…
I enjoyed the flight and compensated for the miss too 😉
Brothers and the day out
After Immigration check I went out and waited near the conveyor belt to collect my bag, spoke with family and ting! I got a message. It said “Ravi, Waiting opposite your exit in a restaurant white tree in front of, Welcome to Europe”
As I walked out, I saw a huge man standing with my name, I waved, and he saw. With all smiles we met I tried to shake hands and he hugged. Then pointed towards another huge guy with a baseball cap. We waved too.
The two huge guys were Robert Woschee and Andre Ruckner. It did not feel as if we were meeting for first time, it was an instant connection. We sat for 5 mins and then walked out. Rob had everything planned. We took taxi and reached hotel. We decided to meet at the restaurant for dinner after freshening up and we did. We spoke about work and Andre gave some special gifts. We bonded over dinner and I got to know more about Germany. We also planned about Monday day-out and realized we all were too tired to stay up any longer and we moved towards the room, In the lift we decided to make a WhatsApp groups to plan things.
Morning, we met at the restaurant had a nice Spanish breakfast and then waited for the taxi, as it was a holiday, we could not find a taxi hence the reception called for it. We three then reached the place called the plaza to start our city tour. Rob the planner had things sorted out and the two little brothers tagged along. We clicked photos and looked around, the tour was voice guided and to my surprise there was a Hindi channel too. While listening to the guide and watching the beautiful city of Barcelona I noticed couple of things that stood out for me.
The graffiti, the Catatonias flags and the medieval architecture. The city has a major impact of graffiti culture, most of the wall, shop shutters and different object were having graffiti some cool ones and some not worthy to look at.
The architecture is a mix of modern and medieval times, the “la sagrada familia” is so fascinating that I had to get down and walk around to see it up close. Its mesmerizing to see the beauty in the complex design. This is where we bought our ESPANA plates and the cool hats. I met some Urdu speaking vendor and I mistook him of being an Indian, he was a Pakistani. My first ever encounter with a Pakistan resident — they look, feel and speak the same.
My reaction intrigued Andre and he was interested to know the history of India and Pakistan, we parked this discussion for later and continued our city tour clicking photos. We felt a little twitch in our belly and there Rob was already taking the Sausages out from his magical bag! The German Sausages, it gave us enough energy to continue our trip and was tasty too. While we chewed on the sausages, we saw the beautiful beaches, the buildings and lovely people.
We had lot of fun and made great rapport between three of us. Here you see, Andre’s reaction to the sausages just to tease Rob! While we reached the plaza, we were looking for a place to hog.
WhatsApp was full of messages from Danny, Maik and Ahcene as we were planning to meet the whole team in the evening, and we decided to look for the best place that served Paella.
We were back in our rooms by late afternoon and rested so we could reach the place Dan found. I was excited and had my fears too, dressed up and checked my cards. Prayed a bit to god to make my Amex work 😉 — The experience with shops and Amex in HYD is sad hence needed god'ss help.
The boys, the office and the Quarter end
Cheriff was the fancy place that serves Paella, we reached about 7ish and by now I could experience the German side of punctuality. Generally, I am always before time but oh! Boy the dudes from Germany are too good.
Maik, Dan and Ahcene are seriously fit, I realized as they welcomed us into the restaurant. We hugged and made noise. The football rivals could see each other eye to eye. I could only image 100 ways how Andre could squish Dan. Seeing the boys live was a totally a different experience when compared to a video call. While I was enjoying the moment, Ahcene was busy folding his bicycle as the waiter pointed it was not safe to park the bike outside, next min the bike was folded into a wheel and kept in one corner!
I got a message, Bhai it’s a baby girl. It was Nand from Hyderabad. I shared this beautiful message with all, and we made a congratulations video and sent it to Nand. He told me he was so happy to receive the message from all of us when I was back in HYD. After a stomach full of seafood and beer, we walked out. Making jokes and getting to know each other a little more. Ahcene is not always busy, he smiles and laughs too. Finally, we called it a day and came back to rest enough. So, we could get to office on time.
Next morning met Rob and Andre in the busy hotel lobby, grabbed the breakfast and walked to the office. As we entered, we were welcomed by the German presales team. The handsome Dennis and cool looking Axel were too warm and as we settled the rest of the team appeared.
The office was so well placed. Adam was in his den as we met him and discussed about some of the IT requirements, which was simple enough for him to take care off. As Kai walked in, we greeted and hugged, and he went in his corner to do the magic he does with the product.
I met all the ladies (Names not mentioned) and the dudes, it was little scary for me as Spain is all about kisses and hugs. somehow, I managed and thanks to all the ladies for being kind to me. Everyone @ BCN office is a sweetheart. If ever I get an opportunity I would run to work from that office or would recreate the magic at home.
The rest of the day, I spent talking to the boys and saw Andre’s magic in action. Ahcene was stuck to his chair did calls after calls. Dan discussed many things and arranged things for us. Maik had Rob and Andre next to him. We had a team meeting and discussed things about work and what is expected from each other. I took notes of things that could make their life easier.
Now was the time I met Nathalie. A charismatic personality and such a loving person, unfortunately there was a client at risk and that was the point of our discussion. Later I got a ping from her about how easy it was to knock out the challenge for us being under one roof. I wish, I responded.
Later after office we went with few of the BCN folks to a local joint, it was Nat’s kind gesture to welcome us and meet the rest of the team. The place was small, specially when you look at Rob, Andre and me but the place was all love and food. Superb evening came to end as I met Mr. Challenge. He is bundle of energy and too much emotions. All he wants is the best for all. I understood he had some unanswered questions so deflected his comments for our formal meeting and a friend helped 😊.
Next days were filled with one on ones with Sales/Presales spearheads. We discussed various things, and everyone was able to acknowledge the improvement in support from past two years since we started. I noted the areas to work on and explained few work flows, also discussed about how different a support conversation is than of a sales conversation with clients. The reason why there are needs for logs more than once or twice. Thanks to my discussion with Rob and Andre, which helped in establishing that East Germany is difficult to handle for locals too.
Meeting Nat and Lorena was very informative as we exchanged our processes. I believe our teams can complement each other more going forward.
Fortunately, former office was next door and it was sweet meeting an old friend — Osarabo. We had lunch together at Tito’s and remembered the old days and he brought great memories of Joshi (Joe) and Me, as what a symphony it used to be working with us. Thanks to Osarabo and Rob for cherishing those days.
Friday was the last day at BCN office and it was the last day of quarter too. The office is mostly full of sales and presales folks and it was amazing to see everyone in action. I can say I have witnessed awesomeness and the Pizza party too.
Again, hugs and kisses but by now I was used to it. Next time around I will be the master of the art. Before I end this chapter, here is one person who brought the BCN office to life. Tony a beard man and happy soul. You would find him as you enter the office and his energy is infectious, he will energize you while you enter to have an outstanding day — amazing member of the team.
Time to say bye.
As we traveled back to airport. I dropped Andre and Rob at their entry gate, we hugged. Suddenly I felt heavy, something was stuck in my chest and eyes were all watery. Crazy I am a tough guy as I mumbled, not sure why the freak water droplets rolled down my cheeks.
Last five days were so lovely and engaging, it felt like I was with my brothers and parting away was causing pain. That’s life I said and swallowed the lump while walking inside the airport. Next min I got a message, Ravi are you alright? the freaky water droplets came back. Yes, I replied.
This pic cheered me up and I was happy travelling back home.

On the 30th March 2022 at the Camp Nou, one of football’s great amphitheatres, Barcelona defeated their eternal foes, but new rivals in the women’s game, Real Madrid 5–2 in the second leg of their Women’s Champions League Quarter Final in front of a modern record crowd of 91,553. To capture a little bit of history I loaded up a cheap one-shot 35mm camera with some black and white film and got clicking.
Here’s a selection of some of the shots taken across the evening with a couple of bloopers at the end because having just one shot at it means that sometimes the stories the eyes see and the pictures the camera take can be very different.
Camera: Reto Ultrawide // Film: Ilford HP5 Plus 35mm
The modern record set that evening would be broken just a few weeks later. The venue would be the same. The manner of victory for Barcelona, this time against German side Wolfsburg, would be just as emphatic, a 5–1 victory setting the table for a 5–3 aggregate victory that would take them to the final.
There were 91,600 fans on April 23rd 2022. As women’s football continues to flourish the records will continue to tumble.
IF YOU LIKED THIS: If you enjoyed this I have set up a Ko Fi page, if you want to, and you are able to, I’d love your support. The link to do so is here and it can be whatever you want.
Thanks for reading, stay safe and be back soon and as promised here’s a couple of extras just to say thank you for sticking with me to the end.

In this series of articles, I will take you behind the scenes of my global adventures conducting executive programs and delivering keynote presentations. Join me as I share my most entertaining and often humorous stories from my decades on the road. You can subscribe to ensure you never miss an article.
Between 1987 and 1988, I spent about one week every month in Barcelona, Spain, consulting for a company that was implementing my multi-track program for corporate transformation. On average, I stayed in that city about five days every month, conducting my programs for about 250 managers and executives in that company.
Typically, on a Monday evening every month, after teaching my afternoon doctoral seminar at the University of Pittsburgh, I would fly from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, where my British Airways plane would then pick up some additional passengers before continuing on its direct flight to London. Once I arrived in London and went through customs, I would then take a flight to Barcelona on Iberia Airlines. Several days later, usually on Saturday of that same week, I would then reverse my trusty route that brought me there in order to travel back to Pittsburgh, so I could again teach my doctoral seminar on Monday afternoon as well as attend to my other university responsibilities during the rest of the week.
As noted, I followed this same routine, once a month, for almost two years. In addition, since I was taking that long, cross-Atlantic trip to Europe, I often extended my stay and traveled to other nearby countries in order to deliver additional keynote presentations or conduct some other top-management programs — before returning to Pittsburgh. It seemed I was constantly “on the road again,” as melodically captured in Willie Nelson’s famous song of that same title.
During my two-year consulting project in Barcelona, the senior executives of that company would occasionally ask me to deliver a presentation or workshop to a group of executives from other companies in Spain in order to inspire those other Spanish companies to also proceed with corporate transformation. The goal was to encourage all those Spanish companies (and Spain as a whole) to become more competitive with their counterparts in other European nations. In fact, in 1986, Spain joined the “European Communities” (12 countries in total at that time), which would later become the European Union in 1993, after the fall of communism and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was clear to me that many Spanish companies knew they had to transform their way of doing business in order to succeed in a much larger — unified — European marketplace.
On one particular occasion, the CEO of that Barcelona company asked me to present my approach to transforming organizations to about 50 distinguished senior executives from other Spanish companies who were already successful inside Spain, but were concerned just how well their organizations would fare when they had to complete with other European companies. Not surprisingly, such an important program had to be planned many months in advance in order to coordinate the travel schedules of those very busy senior executives. To do justice to the anticipated importance of my presenting a completely integrated program for achieving long-term organizational success, the chosen venue for this program was a fancy resort hotel on the top of a mountain, just outside the city of Barcelona. I was absolutely delighted to have been given this opportunity to further extend the reach of my work to several more organizations in Spain — in such a beautiful setting.
I scheduled my usual flights from Pittsburgh to Barcelona. A private car would then meet me at the Barcelona airport and transport me to that mountain-top resort. I was especially looking forward to this exciting adventure, not realizing that simply getting there would be much more demanding than I could ever have imagined beforehand.
When it was time for me to take this special trip to Spain, there was a snowstorm already taking place on the East Coast of the U.S. Since my flights were neither canceled nor delayed, I proceeded on my journey. However, when my Pittsburgh flight was descending on its assigned runway at the Philadelphia International Airport, my plane grazed a service van that had lost its way, due to the blistering snow that had been falling for several hours. Even though we landed safely (after experiencing a huge jolt just before we touched down on the runway), the plane was damaged in the incident and therefore could not continue on its scheduled flight to London. Moreover, there were currently no available planes to take the place of the damaged one. The remainder of my flights to London and Barcelona, therefore, were officially cancelled.
Once all us passengers departed the damaged plane, I checked the flight schedules in the airport lounge: There were no more flights to London that evening. The next flight from Philadelphia to London wouldn’t depart until the next evening. But I had to be in Barcelona tomorrow, since my presentation to those 50 Spanish executives was scheduled to take place the following morning in that mountain-top resort. If I waited for the next flight to London from Philadelphia (tomorrow evening), I wouldn’t arrive in Barcelona in time to attend my own presentation.
In my mind, there was no way I could miss that executive meeting on the mountain top just outside of Barcelona, which had been arranged six months earlier. I had to be there. Period. If that special event did not take place as scheduled, it would be especially disappointing (perhaps even embarrassing) for the Barcelona company that was sponsoring my presentation for those executives from several other companies.
As such, I was in desperate need of a Plan B.
After waiting on a long line to speak to an airport concierge, I learned that there was only one possible way through my current predicament: As it turned out, British Airways did have a flight the next morning at 9 am, which would get me to London the same day, so I could take a later flight from there to Barcelona and still arrive in the evening. But there was a catch: That morning flight to London did not depart from the Philadelphia International Airport (as I already knew from the evening before) but was scheduled to depart from the JFK International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City … which was more than 100 miles from my current location.
Basically, proceeding with Plan B, I would first have to rent a car and drive — through a snowstorm — to arrive at JFK Airport in Jamaica, Queens, by early morning. Ordinarily, the driving time would be about 2 hours between the two airports. But with the bad weather, it was hard to say how much additional time would be needed for my drive to New York City. However, it was now 9:00 pm in the evening, so there would not be any traffic jams on the road going north, other than what slowdowns might occur from the storm. Since I had to arrive in Barcelona tomorrow (so I could deliver my presentation the very next morning), it seemed I had no other choice.
More specifically, that flight to London was scheduled to depart from JFK at 9:00 am in the morning, New York Time, which was 2:00 pm in the afternoon, London Time. That flight was scheduled to arrive at 6:00 pm in the evening, London Time. Doing the math, given those departure and arrival times (taking into account the 1-hour difference in time zone) suggested a four-hour flight. But I knew very well that it usually takes about 8 hours to fly from New York to London, with an average jet speed of about 600 miles per hour. Yet British Airlines was offering that same flight in half the time? Naturally, I asked the concierge: “How is this flight time even possible?”
The concierge then informed me that the Concorde (a supersonic jet that can travel more than 1200 miles per hour) would be making the flight, which would only take half of the usual flight time. Naturally, I (or rather my client) had to pay for the difference in airline fees (since the Concorde flight was much more expensive). But for the time being, money was no object in this adventure: I had to be in Barcelona in time for my presentation! Once I made the reservation for the Concorde (and paid the extra fee), I phoned my contact person in Spain who was coordinated all my educational programs there. I let him know that I would keep him abreast of any changes in my travel schedule. But if everything worked as planned, he would pick me up at the Barcelona airport and drive me straightaway to that mountain-top resort.
After I picked up my one suitcase in the baggage claim area, a service van took me to the airport rental car place. It was now about 10:45 pm in the evening. Because of the storm, they only had two cars left to rent. I was in luck!
By midnight, I was already driving on the road to New York City, thoroughly exhausted from the unexpected events on my trip so far — but I had to keep going. I also had to drive as safely as possible, given the bad weather. In fact, my average speed was only about 40 miles an hour on the New Jersey highway (the posted speed limit was 65 miles an hour), since I had trouble seeing the road through the swirling snowfall.
I finally arrived at the JFK International Airport by 4:00 am in the morning. I had a few hours before I had to check in for my 9:00 am flight on the Concorde. But before I returned my rental car at the airport, I parked on a nearby street, set the alarm on my digital watch, and did my best to rest my eyes and maybe even sleep for a few hours.
At 7:30 am, I was already at the gate, where I then boarded my Concorde flight. Finally, the process was going smoothly. I must say: It was really nice experiencing that super-fast mode of transportation and flying so high in the sky (60,000 feet above sea level) that you could see the curvature of the Earth. As tired as I was, I kept looking out the little window by my seat as I marveled at this amazing technology that would hopefully allow me to fulfill my professional commitment to that inspired group of Spanish executives. Good news: The Concorde arrived in London pretty much on schedule at about 6:15 pm in the evening, local time.
Then I faced the next nightmare on my precarious journey to Barcelona.
When I entered the large room in the Heathrow Airport for going through customs, I was shocked to see a few hundred people who were waiting on a very, very long line to present their passport to a row of customs agents (and answer any questions about their trip and its purpose). My first response: “Oh my God. It’ll take me a few hours to get thought that line!” Since I had missed my previous connection from London to Barcelona (because my plane from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was damaged when it hit a van on the runway), I had to purchase a new plane ticket to Barcelona. I had already discovered that there was only one available flight this evening to that airport, leaving London at 7:45 pm and arriving in Barcelona at 11:00 pm, local time. If I missed that last flight to Barcelona, I wouldn’t get to deliver my presentation as scheduled. I would, once again, be in the exact same predicament as I had been in Philadelphia, just the evening before.
Basically, for me to make it to Barcelona so I could deliver my presentation to those executives on the very next morning, I first had to get through customs, next I had to make my way to the ticket counter in the airport lobby so I could purchase my ticket to Barcelona (and check in my suitcase), and then I had to sprint to the departing gate in time to make the flight, which was only 90 minutes from now. Keep in mind: There was no Internet in those days, so I couldn’t process anything online (such as scheduling my flight to Barcelona, let alone purchasing my airline ticket). I had to get to the right ticket counter, in person, which could only work if I got through customs in a hurry and then make it to the ticket counter in a very short period of time.
With my one suitcase in tow, I walked up to a uniformed customs agent who was positioned in the back of the room and asked him if there was some way that I could get to the front of the customs line, since I had to catch the last flight that evening to Barcelona. I told him that I had to make a keynote presentation the following morning, which was arranged for 50 executives more than six months ago. I exaggerated a little when I added that my professional reputation was at stake, so he would be sure to know that I really needed his help.
The customs agent listened intently and then said: “Everyone in this room has to be somewhere else by yesterday. I’m sorry for your situation, but you’ll have to wait on the same customs line, just like everyone else.” I also listened intently, but I wasn’t pleased with his response, so I asked again: “Isn’t there some way I can get through this line more quickly?” Again, the customs agent responded, “I’m sorry, Sir. But there is nothing I or anyone else can do. Everyone has to wait on the same line before going through customs. Several planes must have landed about the same time, which results in these long custom lines.”
It now seemed that this latest obstacle to my getting to Barcelona on time had thoroughly defeated me. Nevertheless, I thanked him for his consideration and began walking away to get on that very long line as soon as possible — even though the effort would be fruitless in the end. But a few seconds later, I instinctively turned around and walked back to that same customer agent and tried one more time to compel him to join me on my sacred mission: “I appreciate what you are saying, sir, but are you telling me that there is no way under the sun, no workaround, no loophole, no alternative … that would allow me to get to the front of the line?”
This time, the customs agent seemed to express a little more compassion on his face, as if another approach had miraculously, yet instantly, emerged from the deep recesses in his mind. He responded with a brand-new perspective on the current situation: “It seems you are going to keep pestering me for the rest of the evening unless I help you. How about this: If you promise to leave me alone and never bother me again, I’ll take you to the front of the customs line. Just follow me and all will be well.”
He proceeded to walk to the front of the customs line, with me right behind him. In a few moments, I was in the front of the line, showed my passport to the person who sat behind the counter and then answered his standard questions about why I was visiting London.
As soon as I had cleared customs, I thanked my dear friend who had stood right beside me for the entire time, and then I dashed to the designated counter in the airport lobby to purchase an airline ticket (and check in my suitcase) for that last evening flight to Barcelona.
When I was settled in my seat on the plane, I finally could take some deep breaths and reflect on the last 24 hours of my facing — and then surmounting — one roadblock after another on my very long journey to that distant mountain top. Yes, in the end, I made it to my intended destination on time and delivered my presentation to that inspired group of senior executives. Years later, I still marvel at all I had to go through, behind the scenes, to share my theories and methods with people and organizations around the globe.

The race for the Spanish Crown could not get better. Where Barcelona won away from home with an uncertain 2–1 win, both Atlético and Real Madrid lost points: A last minute goal gave Bilbao the three points and Betis halted Zidane’s men with a 0–0 draw.
Following the clumsy 5–2 win against Getafe, Barcelona had to confirm against Villarreal. There’s a difference of level between a relegation side and a European challenger. Something Barcelona noticed very early. Despite having an excellent first half, the Catalans were not exactly comfortable against Emery’s men. A tight marking scheme, almost man-marking, was imposed on the visitors. At times, only Ter Stegen had more time on the ball. Barcelona sometimes found it hard to bypass such an aggressive press, too. Not that the defense helped, where Villarreal set the fight on with the first goal of the afternoon.
Barcelona’s defense forced doubts upon the fans. Villarreal’s defense, on the other end, gave hope. Where Villarreal were comfortable on the wings, where Villarreal found it easy to pass through the centre with through-balls, Villarreal was shaky to put it mildly in the defense. Barcelona simply didn’t seem to be interest into blocking these passes in the first place — that could have prevented so many of Villarreal’s chances — but held on the lack of finishing of the hosts. Fortunately, Barcelona were able to bypass Villarreal’s defense with patience, despite it often needed a lot of positioning and effort.
The reaction of the Catalans was quick. Quicker than anyone expected, including culés themselves. Griezmann first equalized and then put Barcelona in the lead, in only seven minutes. Where the Frenchman is the target of criticism — and rightly so — it’s yesterday that ‘AG7’ has justified his time on the pitch. His goal in the Clasico, his brace today: the man is getting goals, and Barcelona loves to see it. When a 120M signings steps up, and despite the aesthetics might not be there, Griezmann gets the goals when needed. And slowly but surely, he is improving. For how long? What about Dembélé? That is another question.
The second half, however, was somewhat of an unfortunate story, for both sides. Villarreal started in a sub-optimal manner by losing one man to a red card following a dirty tackle on Lionel Messi. On the other end, Barcelona couldn’t take advantage of the situation. With Villarreal pressing even higher, Barcelona failed to control the game. In the wild chaos, a chaos where the Catalans couldn’t score, an incoming goal of Villarreal would be very damaging in the title race. Only one goal was needed, and the 2–1 lead wasn’t for sure the most comfortable lead.
Where Barcelona and Atlético played on Sunday, Real Madrid had to faced Real Betis at home on Saturday already. A fixture of fatigue, one that shows justifies the score perfectly.
There was little inspiration or innovation in Madrid’s team on that (rainy) Saturday. Not that players were already tired between fixtures, but the rain surely didn’t help. Pellegrini set-up a smart pressing scheme, and Madrid had a problem: Breaking the lines. Two of those were on the bench: Federico Valverde and Vinicius Jr. Logical, given that Zidane’s men are set to face Tuchel’s Chelsea in an epic tactical clash. The three points were waiting, but Real Betis reminded Madrid: “You have to win the three points”. Points that were never won, given that Madrid never really managed to break the deadlock.
Madrid had the intentions. Benzema and Modric, together, showed Madrid’s fatigue at best. Benzema couldn’t finish despite some astonishing play, and Modric could barely hold onto his feet — essential to Madrid’s play both on and off the ball, Luka couldn’t run — he was mostly jogging, just like the majority of the team. An excellent representation of the long list of fixture. Except Zidane found out he had a problem on the wings as well. Where Vinicius was needed, Rodrygo and Vinicius were halted. Madrid’s recurrent problem — bar in games where most are fit — remains the lack of ‘x’ factors in the wings. Guardado was comfortable to shut down Rodrygo without too many problems.
Where Madrid’s defending was lazy — or better said, out of touch — Real Betis couldn’t take advantage of Madrid’s weaknesses. Strong enough to stop a fatigued Madrid, but not strong enough to punish Madrid. A sum-up of the fixture, where Betis will regret not taking more points on the score-sheet but happy to have avoided a loss. Madrid, on the other hand, will regret dropping points in the title race when it matters the most.
Atlético’s story is familiar by now. With over ten points of lead early into the 20/21 season, most predicted Simeone’s to collect the damn trophy. At the end of March, with only a few games left, all of this doesn’t look this comfortable as it should have been.
Atlético was the last one of the ‘big three’ to play. Athletic, on the other hand, are also known for being a team ready to sacrifice every single bone available to claim simple three points, a loose match or a trophy. No matter the relative importance of the match, Bilbao is about honor, about fighting for the badge. And yesterday, it was Iñigo Martínez that punished Atlético at the 86'. Where Savic remains composed throughout the match, Felipe found it hard to find his ground. Trippier couldn’t place his crosses accurately either. With the block that Athletic are known to be — and usually, Atlético too — it was never going to work.
Where Simeone thought he found in Correa mid-week his new hero, his new gladiator, the forward couldn’t find the goal. His turns, bamboozling his opponents, couldn’t find the ultimate fruit: The goal. Despite a few shots, Correa couldn’t hit the target, to Atlético’s demise. Only Llorente, out of the three forwards, seemed to display his usual brilliance — far from enough. Substitutes couldn’t help either, may it have been Luis Suarez, Joao Felix or Thomas Lemar. At the back line, Atlético seemed shaky, and in the front-line, too timid. Two ends that explain in a nutshell Atlético’s regrets. They are still first — for now, at least. And it’s up to the others to now take the lead — as Barcelona could should they win next Thursday. Meanwhile, Sevilla have also become somewhat of a surprise guest in the title race — could they also cause some problems? Answer in the next weeks.

In case you missed it, Barcelona have signed a lot of players.
Xavi Hernández has a whole new toy box — and while that’s exciting, finding the balance in his starting XI might be akin to solving a Rubik’s cube. Move any one piece, and you realise several others have to move with it.
This is particularly an issue in the back line. Traditionally, the most stable and unalterable part of the team. “You don’t mess with your centre back partnership”, I hear echoed through the eons of football clichés. And if Xavi is to go along with it, finding the right partnership early is of critical importance.
Today I’d like to play God (or rather, football manager) and work through the options Xavi has at his disposal.
We’ll discuss what is required from a CB in Xavi’s system, take a look at each profile, and knit together a winning combination.
This is a long read, so I’ve split it into chapters. Feel free to pick it up and come back to it.
Alright, let’s get started.
On the ball, Xavi’s centre backs have a varied level of responsibility depending on the game phase.
In general build up, when Barca have established possession, the centre backs are integral to ball progression. That’s because they have more time on the ball than anyone else.
Take the example below, against Real Madrid’s mid-block. The centre backs remain narrow, often supported by a full back (Alba), with the defensive midfielder ahead of them.
Madrid are doing what most organised teams will do: 1) man-mark the defensive midfielder and 2) block the passing lanes to the attacking midfielders.
This is a problem that needs solving. The centre backs need to be smart and technical enough to do so. They usually have three options:
The more of these options the CB can execute consistently, the more valuable they are on the ball. If they have a supreme passing range, and can also drive forward with the ball, they tick all the boxes.
Later we’ll look at the data to help us choose our ideal candidate.
Under pressure
The second scenario that Barca centre backs face is heavy opposition pressure. However, Xavi’s team has a tendency to be pragmatic in these situations, looking for a way out as early as possible.
This means the centre backs don’t have as much responsibility as you might expect.
Usually, they will either go backwards to goalkeeper Ter Stegen — who then is tasked with a progressive pass — or sideways to the full backs. The centre backs don’t tend to take risks.
At most, the centre back will be asked to play a diagonal pass, often to the full back. Which is why, if we’re ranking offensive attributes, passing range is the most important.
Calmness is also necessary, of course. Plus the ability to identify and execute these passes quickly.
Now, on to actual defending.
To be blunt, Xavi’s system is extremely demanding on its centre backs. Not only are we looking for an excellent technical profile, but defenders who can manoeuvre in high-risk situations. Xavi’s Barca commit players forward very aggressively, often leaving the centre backs with a lot of space to cover. Especially if the opponent goes direct.
In this example, eight players are caught ahead of the ball, and Ronald Araújo is burdened with a huge responsibility.
It’s not infrequent to see Barca centre backs isolated like this. Here, the decision whether to press aggressively, or slow the opponent down, is of utmost importance. Making the right call, and executing it decisively, is a huge part of the job.
So the next thing we’re looking for is a proficiency in 1 vs 1 duels. An imposing, athletic profile, capable of either winning the ball outright or (just as useful), slowing the opponent down until the midfielders get back.
Statistically, we can look at aerial duels won %, tackle %, fouls committed, and how often a player gets dribbled past to help find our man.
But wait, there’s more.
On top of this, we’re also looking for the best possible ‘traditional’ centre backs. Those that make important defensive actions inside the box, and nulify the opposition at critical moments.
These players are harder to find using raw data, because their decisions require context to understand. However, we will look at some clips to give us an idea at which defenders excel at this.
Ok, let’s summarise what we’re looking for in our ideal centre back. In a rough order of preference:
With all this in mind, it’s about time to look at our centre back choices, and try to find the right balance and partnership.
Age: 23
At 6'1"" and built like a heavyweight boxer, the Uruguyan behemoth is a unique and important profile in Barca’s squad.
He is clearly Barca’s most aggressive, physical and fastest defender. He wins the most aerial duels (73.5%), has the highest tackle success rate (76.7%) and gets dribbled past only 0.28 times per 90, less than anyone except Gerard Piqué.
In other words, he’s outstanding 1 vs 1, and a rugged ball winner who’s not afraid to engage far from his own box. He’s also a major threat from set pieces.
Sounds pretty good, right?
He has, however, shown some lapses of judgement when defending his own area. Often as a result of over-exuberance. Whether it’s abandoning his position, or getting too tight and committing a foul, he can — at times — lack the calmness that typifies the world’s best centre backs.
But Araújo’s bigger weakness is his on-the-ball prowess. While his pass completion number are good, he is often slow to identify the right option. He can be guilty of dwelling on the ball until the passing lane is blocked.
On top of that, he makes more mistakes on the ball and is dispossessed more often than any of the current Barca centre backs (Koundé has more errors, but we’ll talk about him later). This is highlighted most when Araújo is put under pressure.
He is, however, quite effective at carrying the ball forward. His speed and strength make him difficult to dispossess, and he’s brave enough to take responsibility.
All-in-all, we’re looking at a brute of a defender who, while not dreadful in possession, still needs to work on that aspect of his game.
Strengths: Barca’s premier ball winner, excellent 1v1, athletic and quick, not afraid to carry the ball forward
Weaknesses: Vision and passing range, uncomfortable under pressure
Age: 21
I thought it would be fun to put Eric next, because he’s at the other end of the defensive spectrum.
Without a doubt, Eric García is Barca’s best ball-playing centre back. He averages around 95% pass completion, and is by far the most accurate passer over long distances. He’s also the most proactive passer, identifying options and executing immediately. And to complete his passing profile, he’s deadly accurate with both feet.
He’s also very good at carrying the ball through the lines.
But, as I’m sure you know, this all comes at a cost. If Araújo is Barca’s best ball winner, Eric is by far the worst. He wins the least aerial duels (56.1%), is the least effective tackler (a pitiful 37% success rate), and gets beaten more than anyone else (0.75 times per 90).
It’s clear that Eric uses aggression to make up for his lack of physical stature— and it’s not totally in vain. Only Christensen makes more interceptions than Eric (2.29 per 90). But his aggression is a double edged sword; he commits more fouls than anyone else (1.59 per 90).
To give Eric his due, when he doesn’t have to win 1 vs 1 duels, he’s a reasonably stable defender. His anticipation inside the box is usually good, and he’s 100% committed, always. But at the highest level he can and has been bullied.
He’s young, so he has time to develop physically. And his skillset is so specialised that he’s worth keeping around. But you’d be hard-pressed to trust him when it’s do or die.
Strengths: Supreme passer with both feet, identifies passes quickly, carries the ball effectively, a solid box defender
Weaknesses: Loses duels often, commits a lot of fouls, a very inefficient ball winner
Age: 26
Christensen is a new addition to the squad who has already shown a lot of promise. He sits between Araújo and Eric on the real defender — ball-player spectrum, and I’d go so far as to call him the most balanced centre back in the squad.
Defensively his numbers are stellar. He made the most tackles + interceptions last season (3.13 per 90), while not getting beaten very often (0.30 times per 90), and also making very few fouls (0.78 per 90).
We can infer, then, that he’s a very efficient ball winner. Even his tackle success rate (66.7%) is only eclipsed by Araújo.
He’s less aggressive than the Uruguayan, but an equally effective defender in most scenarios. He wins less aerial duels (only 61.9%), but he’s better suited to defending his own box due to his calmness and positional awareness.
Christensen’s other advantage is a rounded profile in possession. He too is capable of carrying the ball forward. But more importantly, he has excellent vision and passing range. After Eric, he’s the most consistent passer over long distances.
A balanced profile that is certainly in contention for a starting position.
Strengths: A composed ball winner, commits few fouls, good vision and passing range, a great box defender
Weaknesses: Aerial duels, not as fast or athletic than some of his competition
Age: 23
Koundé is a very interesting case, and not just because of the fanfare around his signing.
Of all the centre backs in the squad, Koundé is by far the most forward thinking. He is a willing ball carrier, who is often seen marauding into the opponent’s final third.
This offensive movement has been facilitated by Sevilla’s system. The holding midfielder (usually Fernando) drops between the centre backs in possession, creating a pseudo back three. With Koundé on the right, he has license to break forward and become an offensive threat. And he’s not shy about it.
Positionally, this role is quite comparable to how Barca’s inverted full backs operate. It suits Koundé because it makes the most of his ability to break lines, while also remaining an important defensive presence — particularly in transition.
So lets move onto his defensive ability. He is, undoubtedly, an accomplished defender despite his young age. His combination of anticipation, balance, speed and composure is frightening. Not only is he extremely difficult to beat, he reads the game immaculately, making him a superb defender around his own box.
His anticipation borders on prescience; it’s like he’s moving before the ball is played.
In terms of underlying data, he’s most comparable to Christensen. He is dribbled past only 0.33 times per 90 and commits fewer fouls than anyone else (0.72 per 90). His tackle success rate (63%) is middle of the road, as are his aerial duels (64.5% won), but he has an advantage when it comes to speed and athleticism.
You can see why there’s so much excitement around this signing.
Strengths: Excellent 1 vs 1, fast and athletic, great anticipation and composure inside his own box, attacking mentality and high-impact ball carrier
Weaknesses: Lowest pass completion over long distances (73.8%)
Age: 35
Ah, Piqué. A club legend who, even up until last season, was Barcelona’s most important defender. At least, that’s what the data suggests.
When Piqué was on the pitch, Barcelona’s xG difference increased by +0.77 per game, compared to when he wasn’t playing. That’s the biggest impact of any defender last season.
Of course, stats like these need context. Piqué profited from being fit during Barca’s most successful spell of the season. Truth be told, his level has dropped, injuries have blighted him, and physically he sometimes struggles to keep up.
That’s why last season he went to ground more often, and committed more fouls than ever before (1.47 per 90).
However, his defensive numbers are still very adequate. Last season he was second only to Araújo in aerial duels (67.4% won). He was dribbled past less often than anyone (0.22 per 90). He also made the most recoveries (11.8 per 90).
However (spoiler alert) he’s not in my first choice back line.
On the evidence of pre-season, his physical condition is deteriorating considerably. If he can’t be counted on for the vast majority of the campaign, it makes little sense to give him minutes over the other options.
His experience will be useful, as will his leadership. But there’s enough quality in the squad now to warrant phasing him out of the team. And at 35, there’s no shame in that.
Ok, we’ve finally made it. I think this calls for a drum role…
If I were Xavi, my first choice back four would be:
I know, this might come as a surprise. In fact, I’m going against 80% of fans who voted on my Twitter poll. But let me explain.
Christensen — Araújo — Koundé is unbreakable
This is, admittedly, a defence-first selection. By sacrificing a ‘real’ right back I’m taking away an important offensive weapon, right?
Well, not exactly.
As I explained earlier, Barca commit a lot of players forward. At the very least, it’s the front three, plus both attacking midfielders. Sometimes Jordi Alba joins in too. Purely for the sake of balance, I want the remaining players to be defensively imperious. These three — Koundé, Araújo and Christensen — are exactly that.
This decision is made easier by the fact that Xavi’s right back is often inverted. Working in the right half-space, it’s important for the right back to be comfortable on the ball, carry a threat from a deep position, and manage transitions effectively.
Here’s why I think Koundé fits the bill perfectly:
Why Koundé at right back?
Knowing that I want these three in the starting lineup, the question is who’s being ‘sacrificed’ at right back. I’ve gone with Jules Koundé.
The obvious answer is Araújo, but on the evidence I’ve seen, he’s simply not comfortable enough receiving on the touchline or under pressure. Meanwhile, as we’ve seen, Koundé’s role at Sevilla is surprisingly similar to an inverted right back.
For example, he can comfortably receive and progress from the right touchline:
He can drive forward and break lines in the right half-space, which is an incredibly valuable weapon against well-organsied mid blocks:
He can find runners from the right half-space:
He can comfortably snuff out counter-attacks:
And he can defend 1 vs 1 against the world’s best wingers:
It’s unfortunate that, at right back, you might lose his fantastic positional awareness in the box. But for my money it’s a risk worth taking to get both Araújo and Christensen in the starting XI.
Why Christensen at left centre back?
I think Christensen is a fantastic defender. He was a staple in Chelsea’s Champions League winning team, and he’s shown already he can adapt to Barca’s system.
He’s at left centre back specifically for two reasons. 1) I want Araújo on his more comfortable side, because he’s less composed under pressure. 2) Christensen is better equipped to deliver the left-to-right diagonal ball into the right winger.
Barca create a lot of overloads on the left, with the intention of switching the ball over to the right, where Dembélé (or Raphinha) is 1 vs 1. Christensen will execute this more consistently than Araújo.
What about Eric?
I wouldn’t be surprised if Eric García gets decent game time this season. Against teams that provide little attacking threat, perhaps. Equally, I can see him wasting away on the bench.
His performances in pre-season have been excellent. His profile is unique and Barca are certainly more devastating offensively when he’s playing. But at the highest level, the reward isn’t worth the risk.
He has time, though. He’s only 21.
And finally…Piqué?
You might have noticed that Piqué is the only centre back over the age of 26. That’s not ideal. His level might have dropped, but from a squad-dynamics perspective, he’s a useful asset.
I think Piqué will get some game time this year, perhaps to protect a player on a yellow card, or in a rotational situation. But in terms of development, it’s far more important to prioritise every other player on this list.
So there we have it. No doubt plenty of you will have something to say about my selections and reasoning, so I’m continuing the discussion over on Twitter. I hope to see you there.
FINALLY — this is one of the more extensive pieces I’ve put together. If you enjoyed, please do ‘clap’, it helps immensely. And, as always, follow the page for more in-depth Barcelona content.
Until next time!

7 Reasons why FC Barcelona has fallen so low
FC Barcelona frustrated me for a long period of time. They have beaten teams I supported far too often. Now, the situation is quite the opposite, which brought many smiles to my face. However, I didn’t wish them to fall so far of a cliff.
The Catalans were knocked out of a Champions League. In Spanish Primera Divison they are nowhere near the title race. Things that were seasons or months ago self-evident are nowadays anything but that. Let us look at 7 reasons why this is the case.
Everything starts and ends with money. Unfortunately. Due to COVID-19, the club’s income rapidly fell. Because of that players at some point lowered their wages up to 70%. A case where Gerard Piqué had to lower his earnings to the point that newcomers could join the club before the season (Sergio Agüero, Memphis Depay …) was bizarre. With the ability to earn more in clubs that are perhaps nowhere near the rename of Barcelona, footballing superstars are far from being the biggest fans of joining the Spanish giant. Earning more in an environment with less pressure is far more tempting right?
2. Inability to keep Lionel Messi
Related to point 1. was an inability to keep Lionel Messi. The greatest footballer that ever was, didn’t receive permission from the Spanish La Liga delegates that he could play for free (Barca no longer afforded him due to enormous debt). Therefore, he moved to PSG and the club was left without a player that won them trophies and football matches over and over again. Sometimes even simultaneously. It’s true that lately, he stuck his nose in something that he should not have (more on that later), but since decision-makers decided to tolerate it, his departure was a massive blow.
3. Catastrophic recruitment
Since Neymar left, everything went from bad to worse in a transfer market for “Mes que un Club”. The pressure to add a deadly quality to the duo Suarez-Messi (later only Messi) was enormous. And it failed on every single occasion. Barca has spent hundreds of millions of pounds for the likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Philippe Coutinho, and Antoine Griezmann. If anyone justified their gigantic transfer fees then we should all stop watching this beautiful sport right away. It’s as simple as that. Dembélé was struggling with injuries most of the time, Griezmann was with his head still in Atletico Madrid and Barca’s fan opinions stressed in public made Coutinho forget how to properly play football.
4. Inability to stabilize the team’s core
It would be totally unfair if we have criticized only the above-mentioned players. Arda Turan, Samuel Umtiti, Miralem Pjanić, Martin Braithwaite, Andre Gomes, etc. were all high-profile players. Players that would stabilize the team and bring what is required of them. Instead, these mid-size signings if you like, also failed in the long term. The team was extremely far away from the season 2008/2009 when you can name practically the same starting 11 at 3 AM all year long.
5. Lionel Messi
We covered that, right? Nope. We are just getting started. Despite all the unique masterclass, the Argentinian overstepped his authorization far too many times. By giving ultimates to the club president who should they buy and sack, which became publicly known, he tried to position himself as the biggest authority there is. Even bigger than a club itself. Something like a one-man band. Remember, no player is greater than the club. Just ask David Backham’s rubbed face when it was hit by the football booth thrown by Sir Alex Ferguson when the England international tried to do the same. In this case, Josep Maria Bartomeu didn’t have a plan for how to deal with “bossing” Messi. It seemed that he opted for a middle ground by fulfilling and on the other hand rejecting some of his wishes. However you put it, the full extent of such bad influence is seen now. The recruitment process should be dealt with by the people responsible for that. Furthermore, Messi’s lack of defensive engagement only worsened the whole situation on the pitch. Walking on the field after they were losing became a begging to an end of once a brilliant all eleven team effort. And when everyone is not committed 100%, poor results follow, especially on important matches.
6. Shaken European mindset.
After squandering a big advantage against A. S. Roma, uncertainty began to flood through the veins of Barcelona’s players when it came to Champions League matches. After repeating the same against Liverpool a year later, a winning mentality changed immediately. Catastrophes against Bayern Munich and PSG seasons later were written all over. Hmmm. Let me correct myself. Everything even escalated by not reaching the competition’s knock-out phase this year.
7. Sacking Ernesto Valverde
Being first on a La Liga table doesn’t guarantee you keeping a managerial position. Total madness. Before that, Valverde also brought 4 trophies to the club. After sitting top of the table, he was sacked because of … whatever strange reasons you believe. Since his departure “Mes que un Club’s” strength only worsened.
There you have it. If you think, I have missed any, just let me know in the comments below. I’d be happy to agree or disagree.

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

Alright, Barça fans — with love, truly — but who told you to walk into San Siro like you were on a guided tour of the Colosseum? Yes, the Camp Nou is majestic, yes, the Barça DNA, positional play, and all that jazz. But the Champions League isn’t a stroll down Las Ramblas — it’s the Iliad: every match is an epic, and the gods — fickle as ever — love flipping the script right before the final note. And in this opera, the twist came from a character nobody saw coming.
Because watching Barça up 3–2 in the 89th minute, at San Siro, no less, felt like watching Achilles casually sipping tea. “It’s done,” you thought. Victory in hand, job well done. The Inter players looked half-dead, folded back like they knew how this was going to end. But there’s always a Hector ready to charge in — except this Hector was 37 years old, had beaten cancer twice, wrestled with alcohol and depression, and answered to the name Francesco Acerbi.
And this is where it gets good — and beautiful. Tancredi Palmieri told the story on The Iñaki Angulo Show with that mix of awe and disbelief: Inter, on the ropes, legs gone, out of breath — and suddenly… Acerbi! What the hell was he doing up there? Nobody knows. Inzaghi didn’t send him. There was no arrow on the tactics board saying “90th minute, Acerbi turns into last Roman standing.” Even his own teammates had no clue. Darmian summed it up in the mixed zone like a man still dazed: “Nobody told him to go up.”
And there he was. In the 90th minute, body probably screaming, Acerbi showed up in the box like a centurion who missed the retreat call, crashing through the chaos like an old wolf smelling blood in the fog. A loose ball, a single opening — and bang. With his foot, not his head. No flourish, no elegance — just pure grit. He struck it like a man who’d had enough. Goal. Barça stunned. San Siro exploding. Wojciech Szczęsny frozen like a marble statue watching history unfold.
Because Acerbi’s move wasn’t tactical. It was faith. Rebellion. A refusal to accept the script. That goal wasn’t a play — it was a soul cry. A man who’s stared death in the eye — the real kind, and the kind that creeps in silently — knew that some moments don’t wait for permission.
De Rossi nailed it: “Acerbi thought, this can’t happen to me.” And that right there? That’s not football anymore. That’s pure Nietzsche — the will to power. That raw, vital force that doesn’t just want to win, it wants to affirm life, to scream yes in the face of pain and limits and fading odds.
At 37, scarred more than stat-padded, Acerbi ignored the clock, the fatigue, the script — and rewrote the ending. A guy who’d never scored in the Champions League picked that moment to make his mark. As if to say, “I choose when this ends.”
In that improbable leap, in that lone-wolf instinct, the brutal beauty of sports came alive: the best don’t always win, but sometimes the most human do the impossible. And right there, in the chaos and the glory, a story was born. One Barça probably still doesn’t fully understand. But the rest of the football world does.

Written by: Shane Emch, student contributor, Foster School of Business
My study abroad experience has undoubtedly been the most memorable quarter of my time at UW and one of the most transformative experiences in my life so far.
Through my classes, I’ve had the chance to observe the distinct teaching approaches in Spanish education. The country’s remarkable transportation system has allowed me to travel weekly, visiting destinations beyond Barcelona such as Madrid, Tarragona, and Granada. I even had the eye-opening opportunity to spend five days in Morocco with a school group, where I was immersed in a culture vastly different from my own.
The highlight of this journey has been my homestay with a local Spanish family, where I’ve been fully immersed in both the language and culture. Their incredible warmth has made me feel at home, and I feel my Spanish has improved significantly.
This experience has solidified my long-standing interest in a global career, strengthening my desire to pursue a path filled with international opportunities that will continue to fuel my curiosity and passion for cultural exploration.

This is a super‑brief review of my notes and some information from the talks I managed to attend.
Probably, nobody will be surprised by knowing that AI was part of many talks and conversations. I think we are all looking for the tasks and processes we can improve with AI, the ones that do not work well, and we are all curious about the future. But, as you’ll see, there was much more than AI.
Sarah‑Jane Madden reminded us that it’s not the first time we've been told that everything is changing. Through the years, we have had similar situations, and she stressed how important it is for security not to be late and to ensure that all the work we have done to be part of development from the very beginning is not wasted. We should be involved early because if we are not, we’ll go back to the same stage we were in the past, when it was too late to think about security.
Elliot Ward showed how LLMs are still not a good choice to look for vulnerabilities in code, but using an LLM to analyse results from SAST tools was a good option for triaging vulnerabilities. Elliot’s approach used an agent that took results from SARIF and output whether the finding was a false positive or not, and how confident it was about the result. The takeaway was that this helps, but we still get some false positives. Also, as mentioned in the talk, we’re seeing these agents already integrated by vendors in SAST tools.
As a break from LLMs, Aram Hovsepyan explained the Goal‑Question‑Metric framework and how good metrics answer meaningful questions. He analysed a few cases to see what makes a good metric and how it has to be precise, reliable, and valid, and how we are mixing metrics such as vulnerability types, CVSS, and EPSS when we shouldn’t. Last but not least, he showed clear examples of how a metric could lead us to think one way, but then seeing the data represented tells another story.
Rory McCune demonstrated how an attacker with privileged access to K8s will be really difficult to catch and clean. For example, by abusing APIs that are less well‑known and do not have audit logs. An example was how an attacker could use the CSR API to get a valid client certificate that can be used to authenticate against the cluster, and how difficult it was to revoke it. This doubled down on how important it is to keep clusters off the internet, and again, the importance of keeping permissions tight and audit logs enabled.
Javan Rasokat and Rico Komenda showed an LLM application threat model with potential threats such as prompt injection, poisoned data, and more. Then they mapped the defender side, noting that LLM risks are similar to the ones we already know for the web. There is also the shared‑responsibility model (that we know from the cloud), where part of the security is on the company behind the model, but another part is on the developer using it. They stressed the importance of validation both on input and output, and mentioned a cool open‑source firewall
I finished Day 1 with Paul Schwarzenberger’s demo of the OWASP Domain Protect Project. He showed common mistakes that can leave a domain vulnerable to account takeover and how the project can alert on vulnerable domains and even take preventative actions, such as creating resources (s3 bucket, for example) so attackers or bug‑bounty hunters don’t grab them first.
Kate Labunets highlighted the difficulties of collaboration between academia and the corporate world, showing how the ways of working and objectives are different. The takeaway for me was that this collaboration is going to help everyone, but both sides should make changes or adapt for it to work better.
Spyros Gasteratos explained why the way most teams orchestrate tools via dirty scripts doesn’t scale and how important interoperability is (open standards such as SARIF but most importantly OCSF). Short feedback loops are also crucial, otherwise, you’ll detect a tool not working when it’s too late. To help, he presented smithy, a Go tool that helps automate security team frameworks.
The great Tanya Janca delivered an excellent presentation, sharing what can go wrong in security‑champion programmes and offering practical solutions. Her talk showed the many complexities in these programmes and how they need a lot of work to be successful. While the OWASP talk wasn’t recorded, you can watch her NDC {Security} version and view the OWASP slides with the extra research. If you are building or planning to build a Security Champion program, you must read or watch this.
Two great talks overlapped: Rami McCarthy’s “Scale Security Programs with Scorecarding” and Karim El‑Melhaoui & Håkon Sørum’s “Abusing Misconfigurations in CI/CD to Hijack Apps and Clouds.” I’m a HUGE fan of Rami, but CI/CD security was a higher priority for me, so I chose Karim and Håkon. ( I also knew the guys from O3C wouldn’t disappoint, and they didn’t)
They showed that CI/CD pipelines have become a critical yet often overlooked attack surface. Also, how often they have privileged access to a cloud account, and how simple configuration errors can lead to disaster. To illustrate attacker reach from a compromised CI/CD, they presented an open‑source tool that, BloodHound‑style, uses a Neo4j graph to map everything an attacker could access starting from a compromised GitHub repository.
Tal Folkman made me even more paranoid about supply‑chain attacks, demonstrating how a dev testing a malicious model (from Hugging Face) could be compromised or how a trained code‑completion model could add malicious code without the developer noticing (the example showed the payload being added after a lot of spaces and not visible in the IDE).
If I started the conference with Elliot Ward and how AI was helping with SAST triage, I ended with Murat Zhumagali and AI‑driven threat modelling. Using AWS Bedrock models (for privacy reasons), he built a workflow that pulls Jira info and returns a well‑formatted list of threats. It’s super interesting to see how the new models are delivering much better results, even though the accuracy isn’t 100 %, it’s already reaching really good levels.
The conference was super great, but having so many great talks happening at the same time, and not being recorded, was frustrating.

Eating our way through Disfrutar, Bar Canete, Mont Bar, and more
I made our reservation at Disfrutar a year in advance. Literally 365 days. Right before San Pellegrino ranked it the 2024 best restaurant in the world. We planned a whole trip to Europe around this lunch. However, making that reservation was actually the easy part. The hard part was deciding where to eat our other meals. The options were overwhelming, but I ultimately made some hard choices, and I’m mostly happy with my picks.
I’ll cut to the chase — this restaurant was worth the trip!
PROS: The food was exactly as I’d hoped it would be. It was creative, delicious, and fun. It was surprising, but not too weird or serious. One of my favorite things about high-end Spanish dining is how joyful and playful chefs are with their food. We laughed and tried on chocolate rings and exploded walnut shells all over the table and cleaned our hands with water drops shaken out of a red rose. We ate caviar on top of a butter cloud and inside of a doughy bun, spherical-I olives, and golden eggs. We left stuffed, but not painfully so. It’s not the best meal I’ve ever had, but it’s fully deserving of being in the same category as San Pellegrino’s other best restaurants in the world. It’s a much more casual experience vs. something like Noma (which feels like a special event every step of the way), and it’s closer to the El Bulli style with innovative food in an unexpected setting. While I leave most fancy meals thinking one time was enough, this is a meal that I’d actually want to eat again soon. I’m including more photos at the bottom of this post.
CONS: Just two gripes…
(1) When we first arrived, I was horrified that they sat us at one of the two worst tables in the restaurant located in the entry hallway instead of in the dining room. Those two tables should not be used for regular bookings. I feel bad for the staff who have to disappoint two groups at every seating by showing them to these tables. I was worried the lack of atmosphere was going to ruin the whole meal, but luckily, it ended up allowing us to focus more on the food.
(2) The sommelier did not know their wine list and was unable to give a recommendation for a Spanish wine Chablis drinkers might enjoy. Later in the meal, he suggested a second bottle that did not pair well with the richer, hearty final courses. I’d expect more at a restaurant of this caliber. However, the rest of the team provided excellent service.
While the trip was planned around Disfrutar, we certainly didn’t go hungry for our other meals…
Mont Bar — World-class fine dining in a bar
I’m so sad that this restaurant isn’t in San Francisco, because I would eat here regularly if I could. Since reservations for Disfrutar are so impossible, this is the restaurant that I will recommend to everyone I know. They manage to strike a unique balance between a fancy special occasion restaurant and an informal tapas spot (they self describe as “fine dining in a bar”). The restaurant is tiny with space for about 20 people. Most diners are eating the tasting menu or creating their own tasting menu like we did. When I read the menu online, I was worried that the combinations of ingredients were going to be too unusual, but everything came together beautifully. We all agreed the chicken skin squid canape was our favorite bite of the night, but we also loved the sea bass ceviche, mochi with sobrasada, and tuna belly. The nori seaweed and caviar ice cream sandwich was a wonderfully weird way to end the night.
Berbena — Hip newcomer, still finding its footing
The vibe of this restaurant was perfect. It was upscale but casual, with an open kitchen and a small dining area that was full, but not too cramped. The waiters had a warm style, and it felt like they were all friends and you got to be their friend for the night too. They did a great job offering us a range of wine options based on our preferences. The food menu was interesting and diverse, but only had a few standout dishes. You must order the bread with sides (sliced ham and butter), the tapioca & cheddar dadinho (delightful texture and cheesy taste) and all the desserts. Somehow I did not take pictures of any of the best dishes! The vegetables and main courses were all underwhelming, but I would go back again in a different season since the menu changes regularly.
Bar Canete — Old school tapas, worth the hype
I was worried this famous spot would be full of tourists, and it was — but I still loved it (supposedly the locals arrive around 10pm). You’ll have to force your way to the front of a crowd to check in with the host, but as long as you have a reservation they operate efficiently. We were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation. The waiter was high energy and funny and helped steer us towards all the best dishes. We ordered way too much, but I’m glad we didn’t miss the tuna tartar, steak with foie gras, or crema catalana.

On Monday, April 28, a power outage disrupted travel and daily life across Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and parts of France and Belgium — grounding planes, halting trains, and leaving hundreds stuck in elevators. This is a first-hand account of what it was like to be in the middle of the outage.
“Everything all right? You seem tense,” my wife remarked from the passenger seat. We were in the car, a roaring Peugeot 3008 with brake calipers screaming to be replaced, driving our six-month-old to his pediatrician appointment across town.
I’m a calm driver — somewhere between your grandpa and a limo chauffeur — except for the occasional curse word. At least normally. Yet yesterday, the streets of Barcelona were unusually jammed even for a Monday. I could feel myself getting more tense by the minute. And, apparently, so could my wife.
“Half the traffic lights aren’t working,” I pointed out. “Oh, sh — “ I slammed on the brakes. “That guy on the left thinks he has the right of way.”
“Must be some kind of power outage.”

What does it look like when the idea of care as a practice that sustains life, communities, and cities is considered in an urban context? How can this idea be used to inform projects and planning interventions? Those were some of the questions we brought with us to Barcelona (Spain) where we have been conducting fieldwork this week. Today, we completed our visit as part our ongoing research into care-informed urban planning. The project titled “Care-Informed Urban Planning: Learnings and Exchange Across Countries and Sectors” aims is to generate insights into how care ethics are operationalised in the context of planning and urban governance in selected cases. The insights, exchanges, and warm welcomes we encountered in Barcelona have left us both intellectually energised.
Barcelona is truly intriguing. It is a city that is not shying away from pioneering projects, programs, and interventions informed by ideas around inclusion, Ethics of Care, and feminism. We learned that the Barcelona City Council has set up the Area for Feminisms and Equality, a department with a commitment to gender equality, has established the Councillor’s Office for Feminism and LGBTI Affairs and set up a Gender Impact Assessment (GIAs) tool used in policymaking processes, particularly in urban planning and budgeting. These initiatives are part of Barcelona’s broader Gender Justice Plan, aiming to work on inequality through proximity and diversity and reflect a broader commitment to feminist municipalism, integrating equality into urban governance and public policy.
During our fieldwork, we aimed to understand and gain a clearer perspective on how considerations about care are integrated into urban governance. We are incredibly grateful for the warm welcome and generous engagement we received from everyone who we spoke with.
Barcelona has a rich and dynamic approach to urban governance, where multiple actors are involved in shaping living environments. Care concerns seem to be informing many activities of urban governance. We had the chance to learn more about a range of innovative interventions that make care visible and actionable within the urban fabric.
These include the time use initiative, climate refuges, the justice-based approach to culture, Vila Veïna, and the city’s superblocks (in Esp. superilles). Most of these initiatives are run at the neighbourhood level, and a common thread across these efforts is the idea that care is not just a private matter confined to the home. Instead, care is increasingly recognised as a collective, social, and spatial issue. It is an issue that belongs in the public domain. And as such, it deserves institutional recognition, public investment, professional expertise, and spaces for diverse voices to be heard, especially those historically underrepresented in traditional planning processes.
We’re leaving Barcelona inspired and full of ideas and reflections. Thank you to all those who shared their time, knowledge, and reflections with us.
With gratitude,Romina & Miriam

“Gun store, liquor store, gun store… Where the fuck you taking me!?!” -Dave Chappelle (Killing Em’ Softly)
April 12, 2006
My 3 cabinmates were far lamer than the ones from my other long train trip, so I drank in the bar car by myself and bit my nails until I was drunk enough to pass out. My dad bit his nails too, and I’ve always been extremely embarrassed of the habit as a result. It’s just so hard to quit a drug you grow yourself.
When I woke up, we were in the French countryside, which had no graffiti, but was still quite beautiful, with its’ rolling hills, herds of sheep, and never-ending rows of grapes to be transformed to wine.
That reminds me of a Mitch Hedberg joke…
“I saw this wino, he was eating grapes. I was like dude you have to wait.”
I could feel the temperature, and the moods of the passengers change as soon as we crossed the border into Spain and saw the sea. Only the sea, or maybe a bucket of Xanax, can calm an anxious crowd of travelers so quickly. Anticipation turned to relaxation, as we watched the waves crash into the shore. Redemption was in the air, and I was more than ready for mine.
Stepping off the train, I felt like Uma Thurman in Pulp fiction when she takes the shot of adrenaline to her heart. I was born anew, my past mistakes forgiven. The Berghain, the prostitute, the near arrests… Those mishaps were soon to be a thing of the past. Barcelona, I told myself, would be my travel baptism.
My hostel was only a short walk from the train, and when I got there, I was impressed. It was very much righton the beach. The sand reached the entrance. There were a few guys drinking outside with their shirts off. One of them had a brindle hound he let me pet. Everything was falling right into place.
I was greeted warmly by the manager, who, to my surprise, bought me a beer while I waited for the room to be cleaned — a fine protocol, if you ask me. As soon as my room was ready, I threw on my shorts, along with the flip flops I’d been using to shower, and headed for the beach with my book in tow. On the way, I stopped in a little shop, which looked very much like a New York bodega, and bought a few 20oz Heineken cans. I had my book, my cigs, and my drinks. I was set until dinner.
There were only about 100 people peppered along the beach, most of them drinking in small cliques. I found an isolated area and made myself comfortable. I was almost done with my book and had every intention of finishing it that day.
As soon as I fixed my eyes on the page though, I heard a voice, an American sounding one, holler in my direction.
Guy: What book are you reading?
I looked up and saw three men walking towards me. The one leading the way was pale and gruff looking, maybe 35 years old, with a mullet. He was wearing jeans and a jean jacket.
Me: Hunter Thompson. Ever heard of him?
Guy: No. It sure is big though.
Me: Yep, lots of words.
Guy: Are you making fun of me?
Me: No, not at all. I’m Sam. Here, have a beer. I have one more if you fellas don’t mind sharing.
Guy: Sure, we can share. My name is John. That’s Carlos, and that’s Aaron.
I pulled the remaining two beers out of my bag and tossed them their way.
This was my thinking… Here we had three odd strangers who had been nothing but nice thus far, though I was sensing some odd undercurrents. So, I made a generous offer of friendship, one that would allow me to gather additional information from a position of kindness and generosity, as opposed to weary skepticism. That approach has gotten me far in life. The other benefit was that I was now out of my remaining beers and had an excuse to leave our soiree as soon as my can ran dry. Not bad, right?
Aaron was about 30 years old and didn’t talk so I couldn’t determine where he was from. His skin was weathered from the sun, his blue tank top tattered from years of wear. He wreaked of beer like he’d been drinking for two straight days. And he seemed a bit touched, but that could have been the result of a sun-soaked bender. It was hard to tell.
Carlos looked to be about 20 years old. He was quiet, with dark skin and a 90’s bowl cut. I could tell he was much more innocent than the other two. I assumed he was a local but couldn’t be sure. [SR1]
Both guys gestured towards me but none of us shook hands. We were a crew now, whether I liked it or not. At least until my beer ran out.
John: We need more beer.
He flipped his can over to show me he’d finished it.
I thought, “FUUUUCK, that was remarkably fast,” realizing the trap I’d fallen into. It was now becoming clear that they were homeless people, and John was the leader of the crew. He had me in his sights. I was the mark, and he was going to work me for as much as he could. I scrambled for an out but came up with nothing, so I went along. What were they going to do, kill me after I’d given them beer?
Me: Ok, I’ll go grab a few more.
John: Wait, I’ll come with you.
Me: It’s just right there. I can —
John: I’m coming. Let’s go.
We walked 2 blocks to the store I’d previously been in and grabbed four of the same 20oz. Heineken cans. As I approached the counter, I saw John talking to the clerk, who was handing him a pint of Jack Daniels from the shelf behind the register.
John: Let’s get this too. And some Cheetos. I haven’t had Puffs in like 15 years.
I thought, “What the fuck does he mean by that? Was he away somewhere? WHY WOULD HE NOT HAVE HAD CHEETOS IN SO LONG?”.
Me: Yeah, fine, just total it up. But that’s it. I need have dinner soon and I can’t get that drunk.
I lied. That was exactly my plan.
John: Sure. Of course. You’ll get to your dinner.
John held the bag as we walked back to the beach. We’d only just exchanged names, and I was already 30 Euros in the hole. What little leverage I had was gone.
John: Sam got us food and drinks!
Everyone rejoiced, except me. John pulled the bottle of Jack out and took a big swig, handing it to me after.
John: Here, have some.
Me: Oh, no. I’m good. I don’t even like Jack that much.
John: You’re not going to drink with me…?
Me: I mean, I bought it. That must count for something, no?
John: Still, rude.
I took the bottle and wiped the mouthpiece.
Me: (sarcastically) Is that rude too?
I took a swig and looked back at John. For the first time I noticed the burn marks around his mouth. He saw me staring.
John: Don’t worry, they’re burns, not herpes.
Me: That’s good… Or bad… I’m not sure what you want me to say.
John: My parents burned me.
I ignored him, hoping the subject would change, or a plane would fall out of the sky and crush us all into mush.
John: That’s why I killed them.
I looked up hoping to see the plane. Nothing. Carlos and Aaron were still sitting silently, sharing their beer. They didn’t even look particularly bothered or uncomfortable. All just terrible, terrible signs.
John: I’m not joking, I killed them both.
Me: I believe you. No disagreements here.
John: You can Google it when you get back to your hostel.
He pointed to my hostel, which he’d apparently seen me come from. Another awful sign.
Me: No need. I believe you.
John: Seriously. Give me your book.
He reached out and snatched the book from me, removing the pen I used as a bookmark. He opened it to the last page. That’s when I noticed his nails. They were caked in weeks’ worth of sand and dirt, and there were sores everywhere. He handed me the book back and I looked down at it. It read: “John _____.”
John: Just Google that name and the word “murder,” and it’ll come right up.
Me: Gotcha. Will do. Thanks John.
Just as I slunk back down into the sand, John took another swig of Jack Daniels and yelled, “Hey, check this out!” before tackling Aaron to the ground. It quickly escalated to a fight. People were looking on, but no one seemed to care enough to jump in. People don’t really break up homeless people fights, do they?
Sitting next to Carlos, away from the other two, I tried to gather more intel. Unfortunately, Carlos barely spoke any English. I had some experience from high school and working in kitchens so I did what I could with what I had.
Me: Los conoces?
Carlos: Los conoci hoy.
Apparently, Carlos had just met John and Aaron that day. “What the fuck is going on here?” I asked myself, “I thought they were a roaming band of brothers.” I knew what I had to do at that point; I needed to separate Carlos and I from the murderer(s) before we met a similar fate.
Me: Quiero escaper de ellos conmigo?
I asked him if he wanted to escape with me.
Carlos: Si.
I looked over at John and Aaron. They were still fighting, now even closer to the shoreline, about 100 feet away. I slowly started to gather my stuff, leaving the Cheetos and booze behind as to not raise suspicions.
I looked at Carlos. Surprisingly, we seemed to have an understanding.
Me: Sigueme.
He followed me and we walked as nonchalantly as possible, too scared to glance back. I picked up the pace once we hit the cobblestone road.
Me: Only, 20 more paces. Please, God, don’t let that murderer turn around.
We rounded the corner together then peeked back. John still had Aaron in a headlock. They were all twisted up. We were safe. Carlos looked at me and we both sighed. Then we broke out into laughter, delirious from the fear. Or at least that’s why I was laughing. I wasn’t sure why he was, given he probably didn’t understand John’s admission. I thought about trying to explain it to him in Spanglish but decided against it. Hell, I didn’t even want to know.
The Adderall was wearing off, and I still wanted shellfish, so, in a giant leap of faith, I asked Carlos out to dinner. There I go again.
Me: Tienes hambre? Voy a pagar.
I offered to pay.
Carlos: Por que, no?
He was in.
We walked down a street parallel to the beach, trying to get to know each other. From what I gathered; he was homeless. He was a mechanic by trade, but currently not working. He used to stay with his mother, but that bridge had burned. The only thing he’d eaten that day were the Cheetos.
He spoke pridefully, not seeming to have been broken by the world yet. He had a confident smile and looked me directly in my eyes when he addressed me. That’s always important. He’d lived a lot of life for a 20-year-old but seemed up for the fight.
We passed a couple of oceanfront restaurants before I chose one with a patio that opened to a small dock. It was a lovely place, perhaps too lovely for some underdressed fellas like us. Regardless, we were welcomed in without judgement.
Have you ever seen the scene in The Wire where Bunny Colvin takes the corner kids to Ruth’s Chris, and they don’t know how to behave because of the culture shock? When Carlos accidentally shattered a wine glass, I felt like Bunny, conducting a misguided social experiment. Who was it all for, me or Carlos?
When Carlos came back from cleaning and bandaging his thumb, I ordered us a variety of shellfish, along with a paella to share. I figured we might as well fill our bellies regardless of the awkwardness. And that we did. For the next hour we sat in relative silence, stuffing our faces like garbage-can racoons. The food couldn’t have been better, same as the wine, which I continued to order until there was nothing left on our plates, three bottles in total.
Drunk and extremely full, I paid the waiter and thanked him repeatedly for putting up with us. Then, we exited towards the beach.
That would have been a good time to end the night, I know. But then, I did what I always do.
Me: Donde esta la mota?
Of course, I asked him to find me weed. I knew it was risky, but I was almost out and still had enough Adderall to last for 2 weeks. I needed it. That’s the problem with balancing drugs; if you don’t have enough of one, you can’t fully enjoy the other. I know, it’s madness.
Carlos: Si, Seguro. Necesitamos un taxi.
I got us a taxi and Carlos gave the driver directions.
We drove for much longer than I expected, almost 30-minutes, all of which I spent rationalizing the situation. “Maybe this is where the best weed is? Yeah, that’s probably it… Carlos won’t set you up, you just bought him the meal of a lifetime… At least you have a knowledgeable liaison if things go sideways…”
When we pulled up to our destination, I knew I was in trouble. There were large brick buildings, with bars on the windows, and a centralized courtyard. It was a fucking housing project. Carlos took me to the goddamn projects. Granted, I didn’t tell him the projects were off limits, but for fuck’s sake.
When I exited the car, everyone loitering in front of the building turned to me. They pointed and laughed at my pale legs. I must have looked like an alien to them. My confidence was shot.
Carlos: (hand out) Treinta Euros.
I went in my pocket and gave him the money. He placed it in his underwear and took off into the housing projects.
Me: (sarcastically, to no one) I guess I’ll just chill here with my new friends.
I waited out front of the building, pacing back and forth, smoking cigs, trying to think of an exit plan in case the situation went even more haywire. I popped another 10mg of Adderall too, realizing the night may still be young. A few guys yelled things at me in Spanish, but no one seemed like they wanted to take it to the next level. Still, I was so fucking paranoid.
Then I saw Carlos. He came out of the building with his thumb up and motioned for me to follow. When we got to a more secluded area, he pulled the goods out of his underwear. I was relieved to see a plastic baggie filled with approximately 3.5 grams of green, seedless weed.
Me: WOW! Great job Carlos.
Carlos: De nada, amigo.
He handed me the weed, then pulled a joint from his pocket. I was happy that he didn’t pull it from his pants, but I was confused. “Did he have it the whole time? Was it a freebie from the drug dealer?”.
Before I could contemplate any longer, Carlos lit the joint, took a hit, and passed it to me. I took a hit too and immediately started coughing. I took another hit and did the same. The taste was weird and it made a crackling sound with each puff. “Huh, never seen that happen beeeefffooooor.”
It was at this point I realized that, to my surprise, I was not smoking weed. I was smoking angel dust. The hallucinations started almost instantly. I could barely stand. Carlos, realizing that I was unstable, came to my aid.
Me: Whaaaat wwwaaasss thaaaat?
He leaned in closer, his arm propping me up.
Carlos: I kiss?
His question half-sobered me. Then he leaned in further, his lips pursed.
Carlos: I kiss?
I pushed him away.
Me: No! You do not kiss!!! What the fuck?!
He was pissed. I turned and ran as fast as I could toward the main road where we’d entered the housing project. I looked back and saw Carlos chasing me, screaming at the top of his lungs like a madman.
Carlos: I kiss! I kiss!
I jumped in the first taxi I saw. Carlos was only 40 feet behind us and gaining speed. In my state, it looked like there were 2 of him.
Me: (to driver) VA! VA! VA!
Driver: Tranquillo, senor.
Carlos: (banging on the window) Kiss!! Kiss!!
Me: (to driver) Tranquillo!?! FUCKING DRIVE. VAAAAAAAAA!!
The driver took off and fearfully sped away with Carlos still sprinting behind us. I looked back at him, my heart pounding. He was feral.
Me: Sea Hostel, por favor, y lo siento.
He looked at me quizzically in the rear-view mirror, I think because he assumed I was skipping out on a prostitute without paying. I’m not sure, but it was certainly a look of judgment.
We rode in silence, the cabbie alternating his gaze between me and the road. I kept checking my pulse but lost count of the beats every time my eyes fixated on the bright lights outside my window. I was still hallucinating, but I was at least beginning to calm down.
I had the driver drop me off a few blocks away from my hostel so I could scope out the area before entering. I needed to make sure John wasn’t waiting for me out front to knife me. I wouldn’t have put it passed him. I mean, he slept on the beach only a few hundred feet away and knew I’d be returning at some point.
High out of my mind, I tiptoed quietly up to the front door and slid in. The front desk person saw me and looked concerned.
Guy: Are you ok? Is someone after you?
Me: I think I’m high on PCP. Long story… If a guy named John comes looking for me, tell him I went to Portugal.
Guy: Umm… Ok. How come?
Me: Do me a favor. Please Google “J-O-H-N, _-_-_-_-_-_-_ , M-U-R-D-E-R”
Guy: Why?
Me: I just want to see something.
Guy: It says he killed his parents when he was 16. Do you know him?
Me: May I please check out?

April 13, 2006
The next morning, I woke up feeling like I’d recently smoked PCP and almost made out with a homeless person, which I had, so before eating, I walked a mile to a more private beach and plunged myself into the ocean for a literal baptism. Like Lady McBeth though, no matter how hard I scrubbed, the stain of the previous night wouldn’t come out. In 18 hours, I’d managed to turn my PG-rated redemption story into an R-rated horror film. I’d missed the mark, by A LOT. I needed to get my act together and stop trusting everyone. And I definitely needed to stop hanging out with vagrants. I’ve always had a penchant for hanging out with homeless people. I remember going to a Bar Mitzvah in downtown Chicago when I was 13, and instead of dancing inside with everyone, I took a 2-hour walk around the city and mixed it up with homeless people. Spiritually, I relate. I think it’s the pain that attracts me. Or maybe it’s because I too cannot hold down a job.
Breakfast went down, then came right up, like I assumed it would, so I went to the same shop I did the previous day to get some Tums. The same clerk was working.
Me: Have you seen the guy I was with yesterday again today?
Clerk: John?
Me: You know him?
Clerk: He’s in here every day.
Me: Have you seen him today?
Clerk: (Smiling mischievously) Not yet.
Then, I felt a hand touch my shoulder.
John: Sam! Where’d you go yesterday? You and Carlos just ran off.
Me: I wasn’t sure how long you and Aaron would be fighting, so we went out to dinner.
John: You didn’t invite me?
Me: Sorry, man.
John: Did you Google me?
Me: I did. You weren’t lying.
John: Lying is a sin.
Me: I’m going to take off now.
John: Where to next?
Me: Portugal. Then Russia.
John: Well, it was nice meeting you. You mind buying me some more Jack before you go?
Me: Um… sure.
I paid the cashier, like the pushover I am.
John: Carlos is on the beach, you want to say hi?
Me: No. I gotta go. Madrid awaits.
John: Don’t you mean Portugal?
Me: That’s right, Portugal.
John: You’re not lying, are you?
Me: No, I meant Portugal. I’m going to Portugal.
John: Remember, lying is a sin.
Me: Ok, I’m going to Madrid. My train leaves tonight.
I lied again.
John: Don’t worry, I’m not going to follow you.
Me: Uh, good. It was nice meeting you.
I lied again.
John: Same.
I left the store and booked it to the train station without looking back. Madrid, I thought, was where I’d have to find my redemption.

Who is the greatest football team of all time?
Many people would answer this question with the FC Barcelona in 2010/11. During that season, they won the Champions League, the Spanish League and the Spanish Supercopa. It was a truly successful season. However, there were equal or more successful Barcelona sides in the club’s history. It wasn’t about trophies that made this squad special. Instead, their style of play stood out to others.
Pep Guardiola created a position-based team. Every player knew where to position himself in any given scenario. This positioning enabled Barcelona to control the game. They could hold possession for long periods and therefore have stability.
As the coach himself once said: “Stability is the ball. It’s not to defend 40 meters behind or up front, or high pressing or defend deep or long balls, to be stable as a team is the ball” (Guardiola).
Furthermore, their way of using possession was truly fascinating. Barcelona didn’t just have the ball in sake of having the ball. They constantly seeked for superiority to eventually create chances. It was sometimes slower and sometimes faster, but every pass had an intention.
This article aims to find out, why this Barcelona side is often called the greatest of all time. It mostly covers their in-possession phase as that was most special. But don’t get me wrong, their pressing was incredible too. Nevertheless, most people associate this squad with their possession phase. In the end of this article, I’m shortly going to analyse their counterpressing and why it was so strong.
As already mentioned, the positioning of the players was the most important to create this dominance in their possession phase.
“It’s a game of position, not possession!” (Torrent)
Barcelona’s structure created a lot of diagonal passing lanes and a good distribution all over the pitch. This enabled them to have the ball, progress further up and create chances.
On paper, it was a 4–3–3. But in possession, it was very unusual and asymmetric. It is difficult to describe it with numbers, so let’s have a look on each players role.
Let’s start with the back line of four. The centre backs stayed in the centre and the half-spaces. Besides them, the fullbacks positioned themselves asymmetrically. The right back (usually Alves) moved high up the pitch, nearly playing like a winger. On the left (mostly Abidal) usually stayed deeper. He only moved up on a few occasions, which I will mention later.
The central defensive midfielder (usually Busquets) was the anchor in the midfield. He had a less flexible role than the other midfielders higher up. Busquets mostly stayed in the centre in front of the centre backs and would make horizontal movements. Rarely, he moved higher up.
The two 8s, Xavi and Iniesta also positioned themselves asymmetrically to each other. Xavi on the right played deeper, sometimes besides Busquets to control the game. On the left, Iniesta moved higher up in the left half-space.
The wingers (usually Pedro and Villa) also had different roles. The right winger mostly moved into the right half-space to open the wing for Alves. The left winger usually stayed wide, to open the left half-space for Iniesta.
Lastly, the heart of the squad was their striker, Lionel Messi. He played as a false nine, meaning he constantly dopped deep to connect with the midfield. He often had a tendency, to drop in front of Xavi, to make use of the opened space by the deeper positioning of the Spaniard. Although, Messi’s role was more or less free and he could move wherever he wanted to.
The structure mostly remained the same. It was important that the positions/spaces are occupied, not who occupied them. Most of the time, it looked like in the image above. Though, rotations could occur, meaning the structure could vary for a short period. I will go into detail on these rotations later.
Although, sometimes the structure changed slightly for longer periods, but the principles always remained the same. One change in the structure was e.g., both fullbacks high and wide and both wingers in the half-spaces. This happened mostly when Maxwell played on the left as he is more attacking-minded than Abidal. At this variation, Iniesta would be a little bit deeper.
Only few opponents forced Barcelona to build up deep, as the opposition was often feared of giving more spaces to the midfielders. They therefore sacrificed pressure on the first line of Barcelona’s build-up.
But if the opposition sometimes pressed higher, to put pressure on the centre backs, Barcelona could often easily bypass them.
When pressing higher, most opponents used two players to press Barca’s centre backs. In the deep build-up, Barcelona could use the keeper (Valdes) as the free man, to create a 3v2 overload. The centre backs then would often split wide and deep, to give Valdes more time and space.
The usage of the keeper often had many positive effects to Barcelona’s build-up play. A backwards pass and a pass to the keeper are often pressing triggers for most opponents. This usually led to a striker, who initially marked a centre back, pressing Valdes. Then, the centre back would be the free man.
Even better for Barcelona could be, after a forward, who initially marked a centre back and then pressed on Valdes, another player would take the centre back over. This would again leave a new player free, in a higher position.
This scenario didn’t happen that often, though it showed that Barcelona always had an answer to what the opponent tried to do.
But as already mentioned, most opponents played deeper against Barcelona and would leave the first line free or less pressed.
Still, an overload in the first line was often created, to progress the ball cleaner into higher zones.
Against one striker, the centre backs would naturally have a 2v1 overload, meaning no change in the structure was necessary.
Against two forwards, even though they didn’t press that much, Barcelona liked to have an 3v2 overload. There were a few ways to create the back three:
One was to have Busquets dropping between both centre backs. The centre backs would then move wider and the fullbacks pushed higher up. This enabled the centre backs to be free, have bigger spaces and dribble forwards with the ball.
Sometimes, Xavi dropped between the centre backs or besides one centre back, to create a back three.
The second big way was to use a deeper fullback. Abidal would often stay deeper, to form a temporary back three. This again enabled the centre backs to dribble forward as they had more cover. Moreover, the deep position of Abidal often pulled the opposition’s winger higher, meaning more space were created in the midfield.
As already mentioned, a back three enables the halfbacks to move forward with the ball as they have more cover. This advancing can be very beneficial, to unsettle a deep block.
Many teams aren’t prepared what to do if a centre back starts to dribble with high pace towards them. This quick change of dynamics gave Barcelona an advantage.
One obvious advantage is that by simply moving forwards with the ball, Barcelona was nearer to the opposition goal. Furthermore, it can create a free man or spaces. Any opponent has to press the advancing centre back, no matter what. If no one does, he could dribble freely to the opponent’s goal.
So, one player has to leave his initial marker to press the advancing centre back. This leaves one player unmarked. Either the advancing centre back can directly pass to him, or through another way. Barcelona is incredibly good at finding the free man. Something I will cover more later on.
This is why dribbling is so important for Guardiola: “My first question is always, ‘Can this guy dribble?’ I only want players who have that skill so that’s always what I look at. I want full backs and central defenders and midfielders and inside forwards and winger who can dribble. Because you can learn control and good passing…So, yeah, dribbling, that’s the key.” (Guardiola)
Now that we know, how Barcelona was able to get past the first line of pressure, let’s have a look on how they tried to progress the ball and get into valuable zones to eventually create chances.
First of all, with four players in the midfield (Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta and Messi), Barcelona often had an overload there. These four players mostly formed a box shape or an asymmetrical diamond.
The overload helped Barcelona to find a free player in the centre/half-spaces (the most valuable zones).
Sometimes, the overload was enough, to find the free player. Although, Barcelona also used some interesting mechanisms to find him if it wasn’t that easy.
Now, let’s have a look on some ways to find the free man:
As already mentioned, Barcelona used clever rotations and movements, to unsettle the opposition and eventually create a free man.
You can see the most basic rotation on the image above. Xavi moved deeper, nearly besides Busquets. This allowed Iniesta to move up. Moreover, Messi dropped deeper (mostly in front of Xavi) to create a box structure.
The movement of Xavi usually pulled a midfielder out of position. This opened more space for Messi in between the lines.
We could also often see Busquets making a horizontal movement slightly to the left. This could drag an opponent to the side, which opened space for Xavi to drop into and receive in a deep playmaking position, where he was especially strong.
This rotation occurred mostly, but all in all the midfield box was highly fluid. Sometimes it looked like a box and sometimes like a diamond. Though, the structure wasn’t the most important. What was most important was to create superiorities, find the free man and eventually progress towards the goal.
The fluidity and the rotations had many positive effects and intentions:
The players constantly moved in relation to each other. One big intention was to open passing lanes. Movements could drag defenders out of position, which opened passing lanes and spaces for other players.
The second intention was to move into these open spaces. The midfielders had such an incredible understanding of time and space. They dynamically occupied open spaces. This created a factor of unpredictability and made them harder to mark.
Every midfielder could occupy every space if it had an intention for the collective. That’s why Busquets could also sometimes move into higher zones, to occupy open spaces. The players always moved in relation to each other, therefore, someone needed to occupy Busquets’ central defensive midfield position if he moved up.
Furthermore, the rotations often forced man-oriented opponents to decide between strictly marking or handing over. This is a difficult task to handle. Therefore, a mixture of both often occurred and a player would be free.
Barcelona kept on performing these rotations until a player would eventually receive the ball with time and space. Though, these rotations weren’t the only mechanisms to progress further up.
Barcelona combined the movements with quick combinations, as you can see above. That’s were their famously known Tiki-Taka comes into play.
Sometimes it looked like that they just passed to each other to simply have the ball, but again, every pass had an intention.
“The intention is not to move the ball, rather to move the opposition.” (Guardiola)
The aim of Tiki-Taka, as seen on the quote above was always to manipulate the opponent in a way, to open spaces and create a free player.
Through their structure, Barcelona had small distances in the midfield, which enabled quick combinations that are difficult to defend. The Barcelona players were the best in the world, to execute those combinations.
At the quick combinations, the midfielders and Messi constantly moved related to each other, as already mentioned. Often in the box structure, but also even more fluid, when spaces were somewhere else.
The short passes attracted pressure. Especially, if Barcelona passed to a player with a backwards-facing view. This is often a pressing trigger for the opposition. The opponent thinks he can steal the ball from the player with the suboptimal view, but that’s not the case. The Barcelona player often made a one touch pass, to get out of the pressure. Therefore, the positioning around this player was important to create passing lanes. That’s where the rotations came into play.
When the opponent pressed the Barcelona player with the backwards-facing view, spaces somewhere else open and could be exploited by another player.
Moreover, due to the small distances, many opponents just pressed through and left their initial opponent free, to press another one. Due to Barcelona’s great structure and the mechanisms as already mentioned, they were able to find this free player.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is that the free man should always be supported, to progress further up and use his potential correctly. The midfielders always had that in mind. Their rotations helped the free man to either have more space or a passing option.
Another movement I’d like to mention, which isn’t necessarily a rotation, is the dropping to the side-line performed by Iniesta. This movement can have two effects.
Iniesta could either receive himself with space or he dragged an opponent to the side, opening spaces in the half-space.
Another rotation we often saw was a winger (mostly the right winger) switching positions with Messi. The winger then moved centrally to pin the opponent’s centre backs. This allowed Messi the move around even more.
It was mostly the right winger as he is usually positioned in the half-space and the right fullback occupied the right-wing zone. Meaning no real change in the structure occurred, but different player profiles had different positions.
The opponent often didn’t know how to react to this switch accordingly. The opposition’s fullback was usually tasked marking the winger and the centre backs marked Messi. Now, with the rotations, the opponent couldn’t carry out this task.
This dilemma combined with the high and dynamic role of the right back often forced the back line to leave Messi free and give him even more spaces than in a central position.
This rotation sometimes occurred surprisingly or Barcelona kept this switch of positions for longer periods.
On an individual level, there were two other major ways on how to find and create a free man:
The first was dribbling. I mentioned the dribbling of the centre backs, but also in the midfield, dribbles were very important to progress and eventually create chances.
In the centre, Barcelona didn’t just have the best creators, but also the best dribblers of all time. Players like Messi and Iniesta constantly waved through the opposition with their breath-taking dribbles. But again, this wasn’t just to show off. It also had an intention.
Their dribbles would attract pressure. When a player bypasses an opponent through a dribble, another player has to step up to press the dribbler. This creates spaces and potentially a free man somewhere else. Messi and Iniesta would often bypass numerous opponents and be surrounded by a lot of players.
The other individual way to find and create a free man were disguised passes. This refers to faking a pass to one player and then passing to another. The opponents can be manipulated for example through the view of the eyes or the body position.
This guides the opponent to a wrong passing option. The opponent often moves to the fake passing option, leaving the real one free.
All midfielders, but especially Busquets were masters at this skill.
Another way, to attract pressure were backwards passes. A backwards pass doesn’t gain space. Though, it can be the beginning of a new and better attack. Backwards passes attract pressure as the team with the ball doesn’t move nearer to the goal.
“[…] a back pass does not indicate fear, but the beginning of another, better play.” (Guardiola)
Mostly, only few players of the opponent move up after a backwards pass. This is dangerous, as these players leave their deeper positions, which can open space between the lines if the other teammates don’t move up.
If the whole team moves up after a backwards pass, spaces between the lines stay narrow and therefore difficult to access. Though, spaces behind can enlarge. If the forwards exploit these spaces, they have a dynamical advantage as the opposition just moved forwards.
Especially for Barcelona, the ability to attract pressure was very important as many opponents just sat deep and tried to defend with eleven players. Being able to constantly manipulate the opponent was a big factor of their incredible in-possession phase.
Sometimes, these mechanisms weren’t enough and Barcelona wasn’t able to get into valuable zones. This mostly happened if the opponent tried to congest the centre with as many players as possible.
The opponents would either use four midfielders or their wingers tucking inside (this occurred more often). This obviously helped the opponents to control the centre and give Barcelona’s midfielders less time and space.
But this led to another problem. By congesting the centre, spaces wide enlarged. This is also why Guardiola always wanted to have both wing zones occupied.
Through the constant occupation of both wing zones (mostly by the wingers or fullbacks), Barcelona could stretch the opposition and had always a passing option wide if the centre was congested.
Sometimes, Barcelona could purposefully play wide. An example would be the overload to isolate principle. This refers to creating an overload on one side of the pitch and then switching to the other side, to create a 1v1 there.
Barcelona often combined the switches with the pinning of the ball-far fullback. This would create even more spaces wide.
Barcelona had amazing wingers and fullbacks with incredible dribbling and crossing abilities. So, it wasn’t really a downgrade compared to going centrally. Nevertheless, Barcelona preferred to go through the middle.
“You have the ball on one side, to finish on the other.” (Guardiola)
Similar to the overload to isolate principle, generally Barcelona used a lot of switches to progress and create chances. Often, the opponents were able to have good local compactness at a specific area and stopped Barcelona from progress. From here, backwards passes and switches were very important.
I already wrote about why backwards passes are so important and why Barcelona used them. Something I didn’t mention was the position of a relay player. This refers to a player who positions himself behind others, to be a back pass option. Combined with the wing zone, Pep Guardiola always wanted to have this space/position occupied.
When being stuck on the wing, a backwards pass option can be highly important. That’s where the relay player comes into play. He usually positioned himself behind the wide player and in the half-space. This was near enough to the wide player and near enough to stay connected with the other players to potentially switch the point of attack.
As seen on an image earlier, which I used to represent a backwards pass, Alves is the relay player in the right half-space. Though, mostly a midfielder (Xavi & Iniesta) provided this back pass option. Sometimes the fullback would stay deeper in the relay player position.
Another position which is very important to be able to switch is the link playing position. Guardiola too always wanted to have this position/space occupied. The link player was mostly positioned centrally in front of the block. He can be the immediate option for the relay player or the player to play a switch to the other side.
Again, it didn’t matter who occupied this space unless it was occupied. But it was mostly Busquets, who positioned himself there. Sometimes, an 8 could occupy this space.
The link player is very similar to the relay player, as he can also be a back pass option. Though, he is positioned differently and even more important for a successful switch.
Many teams congested specific areas. Being able to switch the point of attack elsewhere had many positive effects. Due to those switches, the opponent constantly had to shift across. Sooner or later, the opponent just makes a mistake. For example, someone pushed up to far or someone didn’t move to the other side accordingly.
Although, the act of switching alone isn’t really effective. Sometimes, it can open spaces and create a free man, but mostly it’s about the following action. After a switch, it’s important to support the receiver and force the opponent to make as many decisions as possible.
This quote from Adin Osmanbasic summarizes best Barcelona’s way on how to find the free man: “The goal is to find the free or unmarked man by moving the ball, positioning, or player movement” (Osmanbasic).
Another big chance creation method was combined with Messi’s dropping movement in a false nine position. His dropping move often pulled a centre back out of position, opening spaces in behind. Immediately, as Messi dropped deep, other players (mostly wingers) started to make diagonal runs in behind, to exploit this space.
Villa and Pedro were very fast and had a great timing. Therefore, these runs often caused the opposition big troubles. They also looked to make these runs on the blindside of the opposition, making them even more effective.
Messi could then use his outstanding passing qualities to pick a run of his teammates. Sometimes, Messi would lay it off to another teammate who then could find the running players with a forward-facing view.
This chance creation method mostly was successful against opponents with a high defensive line. But it could also be seen to attack crosses in this way.
Everything I mentioned in this chapter combined forced the opponent to make as many decisions as possible. No matter what the opposition tried to do, Barcelona always seemed to have an answer and the opponent more and more questions.
I’d like to finish this section with a quote from the famous basketball player Stephen Curry, which perfectly describes Barcelona’s aim in possession: “The main goal is to just make the defense make as many decisions as you can so that they’re going to mess up at some point with all that ball movement and body movement and whatnot” (Curry).
As already mentioned in the introduction, I will now analyse Barcelona’s counterpressing. Yes, this article should mainly cover Barcelona’s in-possession phase, but their counterpressing was outstanding and it is also connected to the in-possession phase as the structure decides if the counterpressing is successful. Moreover, as Barcelona mostly wanted to have possession, their counterpressing was very important to immediately win the ball back.
“Without the ball, we are a disastrous team, a horrible team, so we need the ball.” (Guardiola)
The most important factor of Barcelona’s counterpressing was probably their structure. They always aimed to have small distances to each other. These small distances were a key part of their in-possession phase. As already mentioned, they used small distances to be able to make quicker combinations. Moreover, the different local overloads in possession also led to small distances to each other. This is a good starting point, but that’s not enough for a successful counterpressing. Let’s dive a little bit deeper.
“It’s about how you place yourself in relation to the others on the field when you have the ball and where you should be so that you can continue pressing when you lose it.” (Domènec Torrent)
@roshanrao_ on Twitter used an interesting approach on how to analyse the counterpressing from Manchester City here:
I will also use it a little bit to get a better understanding why Barcelona’s counterpressing was so good.
Basically, @roshanrao_ divides the structure around the counterpressing action into three zones:
“1. Zone of intervention — immediate engagement takes place on the ball
2. Zone of mutual help — support around the ball through numerical superiority
3. Zone of cooperation — Hold positions for width and depth” (@roshanrao_)
Let’s start with the first zone, the zone of intervention. This refers to immediately applying pressure on the ball-carrier after the ball is lost. Barcelona’s players instantly pressed the opponent after a ball loss with full pace. Mostly, the one or two nearest players would sprint towards the ball-carrier. Although, it wasn’t always about winning the ball back immediately. Sometimes, the presser ran through or looked to guide the opponent into a specific area.
Often it was just important to seemingly put the opponent under pressure even though the Barcelona player couldn’t win the ball back. This led to hesitation and often a mistake from the opponent.
Furthermore, it isn’t just important that immediate pressure is applied. The players also need to anticipate counterpressing actions quickly. The Barcelona players were masters at this. They constantly had in mind what would happen if the ball would be lost. Pressing triggers such as a Barcelona player with a bad body posture, a teammate under pressure or a great run from the opponent were signs to apply pressure. The Barcelona players would then slowly move over and backwards to be prepared for the counterpressing action but also for a potential counterattack from the opponent.
Secondly, the zone of mutual help. This refers to the players who position themselves around the ball to provide support and stability but at first don’t directly apply pressure. The occupation of this zones is very important as some teams can come through the zone of intervention. Players in the zone of mutual help can also act as a second wave.
At Barcelona, mostly around three or more players would occupy this zone. They looked to control the space around the ball by using the cover-shadow and often positioned themselves between the opponents. Also, the positioning on different vertical and horizontal lines helped to control the area.
Moreover, if Barcelona won the ball back, players in the zone of mutual help were often the first players who were seeked to play out of the congested area. Counterpressing actions are often very narrow and random. Having players positioned to get out of this space was also key.
Thirdly, the zone of cooperation refers to players who are positioned even further away. The aim of these players is to provide cover if the opponent can break through the first and second zone, e.g., with a long ball. Additionally, these players can also be outlet options after the ball is won from the counterpressing action.
This zone was usually occupied by the centre backs, the ball-far fullback and a midfielder to provide cover for a potential transition. Moreover, forwards would also be positioned in this zone to be the outlet and to transition forward after the ball was won back.
Sometimes, the structure wasn’t ideal or the opponent could play themselves out of the pressure. If this happened, usually the nearest player would still apply pressure and the other players would fall deep to provide cover.
This Barcelona side wasn’t just beautiful to watch, but also incredibly effective. Pep Guardiola brought the possession-based philosophy to the world of football and started an evolution. His Barcelona team was feared but also admired at the same time around the globe.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is the individual quality of this squad. Without these outstanding players, it wouldn’t be impossible to achieve all this. Though, it’s the role of the coach to fit them into a functioning and effective system. Pep Guardiola definitely established this and should therefore be respected.
I hope you enjoyed this article! It’s my first piece on Medium, so I wanted to make something special. Moreover, I hope that this article was detailed enough but not too long at the same time.

This post was created by Avery V., one of LearnLux’s 2018 Campus Ambassadors. All experiences & opinions are her own.
When researching the “minimal expenses” one can expect for a study abroad experience… I was blown away.
Apartment $1,200/ monthGroceries ~ $100/ weekRestaurants ~ $30/weekTravel ~ $250–400 Miscellaneous ~ $200/month
Total Average Cost per month ~ $2100
I thought to myself, how the hell am I supposed to afford blowing through 2,100 dollars at the “minimum” per month?
I try to be as financially independent as I can, therefore I worked last summer as well as through the first semester of my Junior year to prepare for study abroad. However, even with the past cash-flows, there was no way I was going to be able to afford such an expensive per-month price tag!
For six months in Barcelona, I was supposed to have, at minimum, 12,600 dollars? There HAD to be another way…
I decided to do some research and figure out how to slim down this budget. Prior to arrival, I decided to break down my weekly and monthly expenses.
Let’s think…I have both fixed and variable expenses. Fixed= something that is of a consistent value that is pre-planned ahead of time. Think of an apartment expense, a gym membership, or a prescription cost. My fixed expenses were: my apartment and my gym membership.
Next I began thinking about my variable costs. Variable expenses= a cost that can change depending on the amount and frequency payment of a good or a service. Think of groceries, going out at night, or impromptu purchases. My variable costs were: groceries, restaurants, shopping, bulk buys (makeup or household supplies), entertainment activities (ex: going to movies), daily transportation (Taxis, Uber, local busses), and so many others.
While in Barcelona, I expect to have a complete new category: Travel. The exciting, pivotal, and expen$ive component of the studying abroad experience. Between flights, trains, transportation, food, activities, and special moments, I made sure to be realistic in my budgeting for travel plans.
Lost and confused, I turned to my dad who helped me see more clearly. As a Financial Advisor for the past 30 years, he sure gave me advice (some I liked and others less so). He basically reiterated the importance of frugality, especially as a college student without continuous income. He loved Calvin Coolidge’s quote:
“There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no independence quite so important, as living within your means.”
He then broke it down with an example featuring the smallest of purchases: Coffee.
“So Avery, let’s say you go to Starbucks or Dunkin three mornings a week to grab a coffee before class. Thats roughly $4/ day and $12/week. If you do this 52 weeks of the year… that is $624 on coffee alone! Now, lets extrapolate that to your 4 years of college. If you were to only have 3 morning coffee’s for your time in college, that is $ 2,496. And that is just coffee…”
Wow. He definitely has a point considering I get coffee 4 days a week and pay an extra .50 cents for almond milk!
This conversation sparked a whole new perspective. I do not need to get caught up in our culture heavily fixated on the consumption of unnecessary goods. I do not need to cut coffee out of my diet. Instead, I can buy $10 coffee grounds that will make over 70 cups of coffee. I began to apply this mentality to EVERYTHING.
Here are the changes I made, that ended up making a big difference:
1. I switched out American brands for (cheaper) Spanish equivalents2. I found the most affordable grocery store where I could buy in bulk3. I attend farmers markets for my fresh produce, instead of paying over 70% mark up at the close by stores.4. I limited eating out at restaurants and make more food at home (both cheaper and WAY more healthy)5. I ditched that $6 Starbucks order that only increases your spending, as well as your waist size… I see you with your grande double caramel macchiato with one pump mocha syrup, two pumps hazelnut, light ice, chocolate powder, add cinnamon dolce top, with light whipped cream… ya I’m talking to YOU6. I take the very efficient public transportation system in Barcelona. My monthly ticket costs 76 euros and has unlimited swipes. This compares to taking a 5–12 euro cab to each destination.7. I remembered to KEEP IN MIND THE CONVERSION RATE. Currently the dollar to euro rate is 1 dollar= .80 euro. This makes everything even more than the price tag states. Very important to remember.8. I travel with friends! This cuts down the cost of living and allows you the freedom to live in a nicer more central location.
These changes, although small, REALLY lowered my budget for each month. This task reminded me to stay intentional, think about needs vs. wants, plan ahead, and practice being responsible. Everyone can budget and still participate in everything while abroad. Just limit the unnecessary purchases so you can sip on your extra-special latte at the top of the Eiffel tower.

This season, FC Barcelona’s bold defensive strategy has been central to their reclaiming of the La Liga title. At the core of this approach is a high defensive line, meticulously orchestrated to stifle opposition progression. The visualization below plots Offsides Conceded against Opposition Progressive Passing Distance, placing Barça in a distinct and extreme corner of the graph as they conceded by far the most offsides while simultaneously allowing the least progressive passing distance. This is not a coincidence but in fact the natural outcome of one of the most aggressive defensive setups in world football.
Anchored by the positioning and anticipation of Iñigo Martínez and Pau Cubarsí, Barcelona’s high line compresses the pitch, forcing opponents into their own half and encouraging them to attempt risky balls over the top. The result is a flurry of offside calls as attackers struggle to time their runs behind a relentlessly disciplined back line. By stepping up with precision, Barça not only denies space but also disrupts rhythm, collapsing the time and room opponents need to construct meaningful attacks. Progressive passing distance, a key indicator of territorial gain, is dramatically reduced under this pressure.
Naturally, this strategy carries inherent risks. A high defensive line demands elite timing and communication, particularly from central defenders and the goalkeeper. When the long-term injury to first-choice keeper and captain Marc-André ter Stegen threatened the integrity of the system, manager Hansi Flick remained committed to his tactical principles. Emergency signing Wojciech Szczęsny rose to the occasion, helping the team secure an extraordinary 43 points from a possible 45 in the league. Even so, goalkeeping with so much space behind the defence inevitably invites moments of uncertainty, most memorably against Benfica, when Szczęsny collided with Alejandro Balde while charging out to intercept a ball played over the top.
When executed with the precision Barcelona have shown under Flick, the high line becomes a proactive defensive weapon. The high number of offsides conceded is not a sign of disorganisation, but a deliberate, repeatable outcome of a system designed to neutralise threats before they emerge. It is controlled through compression, and over the course of the season, it proved to be remarkably effective.

In a crowded café on Barcelona’s Plaza Molina, they chant his name, exuberant at the flash of magic. Waiters pound their metal trays on the counter, college students throw their arms in the air, and old men shake their heads in disbelief. Together they shout his name with abandon, over and over again. Messi! Messi! Messi! He’s done it again. On this night, the shining light of Barcelona football has created a moment of legend, the type of play that turns mortal players into a name that is chanted into the night.
I found this café by accident, wandering down the hillside from my flat in Putxet. Plaza Molina, a busy Metro stop, was not my destination. Typically, I strolled past the bustling square on my way into Gràcia, skipping the little restaurants on the border of the plaza filled with commuters and business people stopping for drinks on the way home.
But the lights of a small place on the corner caught my eye. My only goal was to find a place to watch the Barca match and have a beer. The café was small, but I spotted an empty stool at the cramped counter. Drowned by the sound of the announcers booming from the TV, I…

Nearly every European country with a long wine-making tradition produces at least a few sweet wines, some of which have survived the ages and are still considered to be some of the worlds greatest expressions. To this day some Tokaji wines from Hungary, Sauterne from the south of Bordeaux, Trockenbeerenauslese from Germany and others command premium prices, despite the world drinking less fortified and sweet wines than ever before. Spain joins them in the production aspect, if not the price, with a plethora of sweet wine styles from Sherrys, sweet Muscats, Pedro Ximenez, Monastrell and others, and indeed has been making ‘rancio’ style wines since the beginning of our wine making history.
As with all sweet wines, the historical significance is really related to the practical issues of getting them around the world in one piece; going back even a little over a hundred or so years ago, moving a table wine from one country to to another was a good way to risk turning it into unpalatable vinegar. Sweet wines, on the other hand, with their stronger, headier flavours, higher levels of sugar and often higher levels of alcohol due to fortification were the drink of choice, as they would arrive at their destination more or less intact. This was particularly important in warm countries such as Spain, where a single hot day in the baking Mediterranean sunshine is enough to turn your fresh, fruity red wine into something quite dull and uninteresting.
However, with the advent of modern technologies, sweet and fortified wine sales have fallen through the floor over the last 40 years, with most modern consumers opting for lighter, drier wines that are usually a little easier to pair with food. Wines no longer need to be powerful and sweet to survive before being consumed and as a result, the market for sweet wines is dwindling away. One silver lining of this, of course, is that it’s generally the best producers who are left making the remaining wines, and they’ve been recently joined by some ambitious attempts to recreate different styles, often using very new technologies such as cryo-extraction in places not previously renowned for these styles of wine. It was my pleasure to introduce 5 such wines to our tasting last week and showcase the depth of options available in Spain alone, which whilst may not become the mainstay of an individuals collection, certainly have their place at the dinner table.
Gramona “Vi de Glass” Riesling 2011: We kicked off the evening with probably the least traditional style of fortified wine made in Spain; ice wine made not be the natural elements dropping down well below zero, but using a chamber designed to artificially freeze the grapes prior to pressing. This has been a technology used in France since the late 1980s but was started to be used by Gramona in 1997. The premise is identical to that of the natural production of ice wine in both Germany and Canada; freezing the water in the grapes and squeezing out a thick, viscous juice from the resulting press with a lot of varietal flavour, sugar and acid. However, doing this artificially gives a great deal of control over the process as you can choose at which temperature you’d like to freeze the grapes. The higher the concentration of sugar, the lower the temperature needed to freeze the water in the grapes themselves, and the less juice you receive per ton. Therefore, winemakers can now choose the quantity of the icewine they need and adjust the temperature accordingly; lower temperatures mean that only the ripest juice is allowed to leave the press, but lowers quantity substantially. In France the common practice is to freeze grapes at -6ºC. Gramona by comparison choose to make their wine at -15ºC. I was surprised at how good this was, retaining both the youthful fruit and minerality of the Riesling in a good balance with the sugar levels. The bottle is a little difficult to store, but makes for a wonderful centre piece!
Jorge Ordonez №2 Victoria 2015: We went from perhaps the least typical style of Spanish sweet wine to perhaps its most; sweet Muscat from Malaga. DO Malaga is interestingly the only DO in Spain to focus entirely on the production of sweet wine, having been influential in the courts of Medieval Europe and peaking in popularity in the 19th century with its recently revived “Mountain Wine”. Muscat de Alexandria, the ugly ducking to Muscat a Petit Grains, is rife here with its grapey, floral aromas, naturally high sugar and delicate nature. Jorge Ordonez has a range of 4 in total, all made in a naturally sweet style from over-ripe grapes, increasing in sugar level and flavour intensity. We went for number 2, Victoria 2015 which is a lovely, softly honeyed wine with a very approachable 10% ABV and a lovely light, delicately floral character. Of all the wines poured over the evening, this probably lasted the least amount of time in the glass!
Perelada Garntaxa de 12 Anys: Our first meeting with a fortified wine and we went for a sweet Grenache from the Emporda, a region in the very north of Catalunya bordering France. In fact, this proximity to France goes some way to explain the style of this wine, made as it is in a Solera system. The south of France, Roussilon in particular, is home to a great deal of appellations famous for producing sweet wine and the effects are felt in the north of Catalunya, where many of these old constructions still exist and are making top quality wine to this day. This is actually my favourite style of sweet wine from Catalunya, combining the lovely dried red fruit character of the Grenache with the long, slow 12-year ageing process of the Solera system to provide a complex, sweet and very endearing wine as a result. Perelada are a big company producing a lot of very good, and some decidedly average, wine, but I’d be happy to have a few bottles of this lying around at any given time!
Castaño Dulce 2013 — We headed down to the Levant for wine number 4 and a chance to try perhaps the least obviously sweet wine of the day. I say this because the sweet Monastrell, made from grapes dried in the sun and often fermented in open wooded vats, is more akin to a structured red wine with a lot of sugar than a traditional sweet wine. The Castañofamily have been revolutionary in DO Yecla, from helping win the DO regulatory system to investing heavily into opening international markets for the region and with the quality of the wine they’re producing now, I can safely say that it’s been a successful drive for a still relatively unknown area. Bold, bright and tannic, this would be a delicious pairing for medium-strength cheeses, light chocolate desserts and almost anything with red fruit in it.
Don PX Toro de Albala Gran Reserva 1986 — It wouldn’t be a sweet wine tasting if we didn’t dip our toe into the sweetest of them all; Pedro Ximenez, made in DO Montilla-Moriles with almost 380 grams of sugar a litre. Pedro Ximenez is one of the worlds naturally sweetest grape varieties, accumulating sugar rapidly, encouraged by exceptionally late harvesting when they’re essentially raisins on the vine. These dry grapes are then picked, pressed and fermented to a few degrees of alcohol before being fortified to retain this incredible level of sugar. PX, as it’s more commonly known, is still used to sweeten certain wines, often Sherry destined for ‘Cream’ status of some sort, but more often is aged in a Solera system for an incredibly long time, becoming deeply oxidised, concentrated and dark in the process. There are also single vintage PX wines like the above, aged in oak barrels for a staggering 28 years before commercial release. My personal preference is to drizzle this over vanilla ice-cream with walnuts and almonds, but a small glass is also a hedonistic pleasure from time to time!
This was certainly not a tasting for the faint of heart, but a real treat to try so many sweet wines from across the country. The general feeling before the tasting was one of “I don’t really drink sweet wines, so I’m interested to see how they fare.’ Based on the evidence, I hope we’ve converted a few more lovers of dessert wines, the industry certainly needs a few more! If you’d like to learn more about Spanish wine and attend a tasting in Barcelona, make sure to check out the options here, from private tastings to our weekly published tastings. Until then, salut!

The non remote events are back, which is great!
I had the opportunity to attend for the first one (for me) after the pandemic and I did a little summary to share my thoughts about it.
I am Borja Pernía, a Venezuelan software developer who has lived in Barcelona since 2012. I have been working at ManoMano since January 2020 and I like to assist to different events related to software development.
For personal reasons, I only could assist the first day during the morning and this is the summary of the talks that I assisted.
They talked about the necessity to use OpenTelemetry
Important concepts in observability
First steps into the Voxel implementation
What is OpenTelemetry?
Demo time!
Questions & Answers
Quick overview of data disciplines
The infrastructure for handle data in Hotjar
About data qualityImportant: accuracy, consistency, completeness, timeliness, validity, uniqueness
Lessons learned
As a summary, the talks that I assisted had interesting topics that could help us to improve our day-to-day work in several levels (to know several ways to have a better functional programming experience, to understand how to monitorize our applications in a correct and simpler way or starting to build a BI infrastructure based on the experience of somebody that already lived it).
I enjoyed coming back to a face-to-face event with a great set of speakers, , and a good mood among the crowd. I hope to attend next year’s edition too :)
If you want to continue the conversation about this or other events, contact or chat with me on LinkedIn.
As usual in this kind of events, the opening was a moment to present the team involved and thanked to the sponsors (ManoMano included! \o/ ). Something that was new for me: the post-covid protocol during the event (use of masks, leave the rooms at the end of the talks, etc.) and the presentation of two organizations (BCN women who code and Codebar).

About a month after moving to Barcelona, I learned that one of my co-workers also lived there. I was ecstatic to meet another digital nomad in their 30s. The prospect of meeting someone I enjoyed working with for over a year was even more exciting. I couldn’t wait to see her!
I called a cab, and Uber directed me to Las Ramblas to wait. If you don’t already know this, Las Ramblas is known as “the World’s Most Pickpocketed Street.” I followed my usual precautions and stood with my back against a hotel wall.
As I waited, a gentleman approached. He was young, pulling a large suitcase as he walked toward the hotel’s grand entrance. The person next to him seemed to playfully snatch an item out of his hand. He turned around and grabbed the person by his shirt. They jumped into oncoming traffic to get away.
At first, I thought, “Look at these two fools in the street! They’re about to get hit by a car.”
But then I realized they weren’t friends. It wasn’t two guys roughhousing each other recklessly. One had just been robbed.
It was broad daylight: around 2 PM on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I couldn’t believe it.

I like to participate in boutique-like forest trail ultras where there are only a handful of runners but last month I somehow managed to run the Zurich Barcelona Marathon with 16000+ runners signed up.
I usually don't care about my finishing time as any finished ultra is a success for me regardless of time. But now I ran a marathon distance with many other runners and this made me think about the end result.
I found this presentation of my result clean and simple but incredibly boring.
My finishing time was 3:31:44. I'm relatively happy with that time but I know that I got tired in the end. How did that compare to the people around me? How fast are the pro runners compared to me?
I decided to take all the results I could find and write a small program that would give me a more visual overview of the event.
First thoughts:
I also took a look into the finishing times and it seems that people who aimed under 3h and under 4h were pretty successful (no peak after the time in a graph) but it seems that a lot of runners with aim of 2h45min, 3h30min and 4h15min barely missed their mark.
The slower you are, the more you slow down in the second half of the race. People around the 4h finishing time were avg 10% slower in the 2nd half, that means a whopping 24min added.
And the race starts from the 25th km :) Almost everybody is able to hold the pace till 25th km but every next kilometre is getting harder to keep the pace.
Regardless of your results, it's amazing to see so many people running! We are all winners!

Each new trip announced by Celebrity sounds better than the last. Clearly the trip of a lifetime for many would be to spend some time in Rome, then cruise through the Greek Islands, and end up in Barcelona. That is the opportunity you will have if you book this incredible journey for ten days beginning in Rome on September 5, 2022. What makes it even better is this trip is on Celebrity’s newest ship BEYOND.
Now that alone sounds exciting, but add Celebrity has announced celebrating the BEYOND, and traveling with you, will be no less than Celebrity Cruises’ President and CEO, Lisa Lutoff-Perlo. Just imagine being on the ship with her, with Captain Kate McCue at the helm, and special host and Greece native, Captain Dimitrios Kafetzis, who will lead everyone on amazing tours throughout the sailing. It doesn’t get better than this.
This cruise gives regular Celebrity travelers a chance to reconnect with fellow Captain’s Club members meeting old friends and making new ones. There will be special events like a Santorini sail away with local entertainment, cuisine, and as usual in the Greek Islands one of the most beautiful sunsets in the world.
Now you begin your journey in Rome where you will meet the ship. If you are like me, you will want to spend a few days in Rome before you board. One can’t help love this Eternal City. The incredible Trevi fountain where you will throw a coin in to guarantee you will return again and again.
Then if you haven’t seen it before you must take this opportunity to embrace the power of Michelangelo’s vision at the truly inspiring Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. Then you board your ship on September 5th and take a walk around to start to appreciate its incredible beauty.
The excitement mounts for your visit to eight different ports. First Olympia, where the first Olympic Games were held in 776 B.C. Then among other exciting adventures discover the prehistoric Akrotiri ruins in Santorini, and enjoy the world-famous sunset while sipping some wine from a local vineyard. Hike to the spectacular Lindos Acropolis summit in Rhodes, and marvel at the Temple of Poseidon’s ancient glory in Athens. In Malta, admire the glittering baroque interior of St. John’s cathedral. Of course, no trip through the Greek Islands would be complete without a stop in beautiful Mykonos with its narrow white washed streets, my favorite Island, where I have spent many memorable vacations over the years.
Then while onboard this incredible newest of the Edge® Series ships, you can experience a signature restaurant by the renowned Chef Daniel Boulud (make your reservation early); the reimagined Grand Plaza inspired by the piazzas of Italy; a Rooftop Garden that extends out beyond the ship’s edge; and the new expanded two-tiered Sunset Bar. The Sunset Bar being one of my favorite places on any Celebrity ship.
You will be treated to great entertainment in the BEYOND’s theater which surpasses all other ships with its state-of-the-art technology. Then you end your cruise in the exciting city of Barcelona and what could be better than that?
I have been told by friends who took BEYOND’s maiden cruise that once onboard you will understand what Celebrity has said; this ship was designed to change the way you experience the world. Even the incredible artwork on board is worth the trip.
So look at your calendar. It you have the time, or can make the time, get in touch with Celebrity or better yet my travel agent Scott Moster, an expert on Celebrity and all cruises, at scott@myluxcruise.com; and book this exciting cruise today.

Hop on the time machine for a moment. We are going back to 2011. FC Barcelona was arguably the best club in the world. Nobody can forget their attacking, quick-passing, total football display versus a stacked Manchester United side managed by Sir Alex Ferguson under the lights of the great Wembley Stadium in the Champions League final. The match ended 3–1 with a goal apiece from Barcelona’s starting front 3 as they were crowned champions of Europe. Experts and pundits predicted a decade of dominance from the Blaugranas with Pep Guardiola at the helm and exciting youngsters from La Masia under his wing.
Fast-forward to 2021, FC Barcelona are in a financial mess, of around 1 billion Euros, unable to register their greatest player ever and their new signings due to the extreme wage budget. Things on the pitch haven’t been great either, with humiliations vs Roma, Liverpool, Bayern and PSG in the last 4 years being the main talking points. They do have, what many fans believe to be, the perfect leader in Joan Laporta. He has to clean this financial mess and needs to make proper signings to bring the club to where it used to be. He has made a few in Aguero, Depay, Emerson and Eric Garcia. Eric Garcia seems to be the replacement for the ageing Pique. There are other options in that position in Oscar Mingueza and the very promising, Ronald Araujo.
But the glaring void is seen in the left centre-back position. Clement Lenglet has never been the same since the Bayern debacle, with his numerous mistakes leading to costly points dropped in the league and Samuel Umtiti is not even a shadow of himself after constant injuries and pretty much zero game time. I personally think that the club needs a new signing at the left CB position and must look for one in this summer itself, if possible. So, in this article, we see some of the available and affordable options in that position and hopefully, finalize one player to help Barcelona fill the void.
All the data used in this article is from the brilliant fbref.com and the videos used for eye-test is from fullmatchsports.com.
REQUIREMENTS FOR A FC BARCELONA CENTRE-BACK
1. The current manager, Ronald Koeman started out with a 4–2–3–1 upon his arrival and moved to a 3–5–2/3–1–4–2 as he gathered that his CBs were being exposed in a 4-at-the-back system with their lack of pace. His decision to switch to a back three has produced good results and Barcelona has gained a bit of stability since. So, our centre-back should be able to slot in the left of a three-at-the-back system and as the left CB in a 4-ATB, if Koeman plans to revert back to one.
2. The centre-back should have excellent ball distribution. He should be able to play the ball out from the back with minimal errors. He must be able to distribute passes from the back to the LB(Mostly Jordi Alba) and line-breaking passes to the midfielders. He should also be able to carry the ball forward with confidence and find one of the teammates when there is space ahead.
3. He should be very good under pressure and be able to get himself out of it using quick thinking and good decision-making.
4. Jordi Alba is often closer to the attackers than the defenders. So, our new CB must take the responsibility of providing cover in the left flank. Even if he lacks pace, he must be very aware positionally and thus help the team to regain possession quickly by winning the ball when the opponent decides to break and counter.
5. He must be good aerially and make sensible decisions when opponents take the long-ball approach.
6. In a 3 ATB, he will play with Eric Garcia and Ronald Araujo mostly. Garcia is a very ‘Pique’ type defender, not too quick but relies heavily on his positional awareness and a decent on-the-ball defender. Araujo is strong, aerially dominant, faster than the average centre-back but doesn’t possess the best ball playing qualities. Our CB must compliment both the CBs by providing cover for Garcia’s lack of pace and Araujo’s lack of technicality.
7. Brownie points if he has already played in a team which plays possession-based attacking football.
THE FIRST DRAFT
Our first draft of players includes left-footed CBs in top clubs from Europe’s top 5 leagues. The selected CBs play in clubs only from which Barcelona can buy, so players from direct domestic rivals and Euroepan rivals are excluded. The 5 CBs from our first draft in no particular order are :
We will now use the fbref data available to get an idea of what each player offers to their respective teams and what they can offer for FC Barcelona. All the data is from the 2020/21 league season and is adjusted to per 90 minutes. The five-man draft will be deduced to a final shortlist of three for eye-test.
DATA ANALYSIS
Defensive Contribution : In this plot, we measure the defensive capabilities of the CBs using their Tackles+Interceptions numbers and Successful pressures that helped their team win the ball back. From the possession-adjusted data, we can clearly see how Bastoni leads his peers in both metrics. Botman is not far either. Pau Torres fails to impress here.
Discipline : Unsuccessful tackles or pressures might lead to fouls and bookings and this plot gives an idea of how clean/dirty the CBs are. Botman is the cleanest of them all, even though he had higher tackling and pressure numbers. Laporte obviously has higher numbers considering him playing in a team that dominates possession almost every game.
Passing : A very important attribute for a FC Barcelona centreback. Laporte excels in both progressive and final third passes while Botman, Pau and Bastoni have good numbers too. Romagnoli doesn’t make a case for him here.
Carries : While Bastoni leads in final third carries, Laporte once again exhibits his brilliant on-ball ability by completing around 10 progressive carries p90. Romagnoli does not possess the same on-ball characteristics as the others.
Aerial Prowess : Something that is a must for a Barca CB is good aerial ability. Teams tend to exploit the high defensive line of Barcelona and the CBs have to be aware of balls over the top to the forward or in the wings. Laporte once again leads the pack with Romagnoli second and Botman a close third.
From the above metrics, there are three standouts.
Alessandro BastoniAymeric LaporteSven Botman
With eye-test by watching previous matches, the strengths and weaknesses in each of the three players’ game are noted. There are few other factors in each player which are also taken into consideration. They will be explained below. Now, let us take a look at each player.
ALESSANDRO BASTONI
Pros : Bastoni is widely regarded as the future of Italian defence. At such a young age of 22, Bastoni has already established him as an undisputed starter at Inter. He has already played in a 3 ATB under his club manager Antonio Conte. Bastoni is skilled in switching the play to the right wingback with quick and accurate switch passes. He also often finds Lukaku by threading a ball over the top in/around the left half space behind the defensive line. This can be mirrored here, by using Fati/Depay as the receiver. This could benefit Barcelona when they are trying to find a way through low-block teams. He is also a very confident ball carrier and has the ability to find a progressive/key pass following that carry. He is quick enough to recover when he loses possession.
Cons : Bastoni doesn’t have any obvious weaknesses in his personal game. There are some other factors, though. His defensive partners at Inter have been two experienced CBs in Milan Skriniar and Stefan De Vrij. While Barca needs some experience to settle their defence for their pursuit of the league and the Champions League, signing Bastoni means he becomes one of the many young defenders Barca have. It is also a huge gamble to bring him from Serie A to La Liga for such a huge price (60M Euros according to transfermarkt.com, might even be more), which makes him the most expensive defender in La Liga history. A question remains on would he justify the price tag. Barca cannot afford another failed transfer, if Bastoni does fail.
Verdict : Bastoni is an excellent defender and a fantastic investment for the future. He possesses all qualities to become a Barcelona defender but in the current financial situation, he is an expensive, ambitious and risky option who Barca might have to stay away from, for now.
AYMERIC LAPORTE
Pros : Laporte has lost his place to Ruben Dias in the city defence. He is such a quality defender to not be playing regularly. Laporte had a brilliant Euro 2020 partnered with either Garcia or Pau Torres. He has the knack of finding line-breaking passes and is a supreme carrier of the ball, one of the best in the business. He has brilliant positional awareness and commits minimal errors while playing out from the back. He has played in a 3 ATB in City in a few instances. He also plays under Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique who share the similar philosophy as Barca. He is cheaper(45M Euros according to transfermarkt.com) and has better experience in big stages. There are various news outlets suggesting that he wants out because of his lack of game time.
Cons : Laporte’s only weakness might be his lack of pace. Also, Manchester City might not sell another CB as that would leave them with only three natural centre-backs(Dias, Stones, Ake). They might demand huge money. Barca may have to sell two or more players to meet City’s asking price.
Verdict : Laporte is a low-risk high quality CB, who fits in Barca’s defence like a glove but there are a few complications financially, which should be solved for this transfer to go through.
SVEN BOTMAN
Pros : Fresh from winning Ligue 1 with Lille, Botman is one of the most sort out CBs at the moment. He is 195 cm tall, strong and physically imposing which is very similar to Ronald Araujo. But, he differs from Araujo in the fact that he has brilliant on-the-ball quality. He often finds the LW/LB with a through ball behind the lines that puts them in space to run into. He is also brilliant in 1v1 situations and makes calculated tackles. Due to his height and huge physique, he can be a much needed set-piece threat. He is the least expensive of the three options(28M Euros according to transfermarkt.com).
Cons : Just 21 years old, Barcelona cannot expect any kind of experience from the dutchman. He is not a natural ball carrier like Laporte and is not upto the mark in his aerial distribution. He also struggles a bit when put under pressure and makes some hasty decisions. He has often played in a 4 ATB system, but has never been tested in a 3 ATB system.
Verdict : Though less expensive, Botman has had only one season in the Ligue 1 and it would be a huge gamble if Barcelona decide to keep faith on him, which I think is not the best thing to do.
CONCLUSION
Laporte definitely edges both of them with his experience. Even though his price is a problem, his recent success in the Euros and him sharing the same dressing room with Alba, Busquets, Pedri and Garcia means he would be the most fitting of all the options. 45M is a monstrous price in these circumstances but he has already proven his quality in the PL after arriving at Manchester City with a similar price tag. FC Barcelona receives a centre-back who fits their playstyle and more importantly, brings much needed experience and quality. Come on Mr. Laporta, import Laporte to the Nou Camp !

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

I was in Barcelona for an event last week. Also, it’s the first time in Barcelona for me. I know that the city is one of the best as the “city design” in the world. But I saw it with a different eye. Can it be also the best city as we think in user experience?
First of all, I loved the city. In Europe, there is just Portugal I haven’t visited yet and the only city/country that I want to live in is Rotterdam. It is a “lively” city that has lots of foreigners and everyone knows English (so I don’t need to learn Dutch that I already learned!). Also, there are lots of “expats” so you feel comfortable as a foreign. And, of course, Berlin is the city that I want to go to again and again :). After all, Barcelona is the second city I want to go to again and maybe to live there!
I loved the city not because everyone knew English and I felt comfortable about everything (to be honest, just a few people know English, we had such hard times to communicate). I loved the city because both the city and the people make you feel comfortable about living in the environment.
As I said, I saw just a few people who know English very well, and again just a few who know English “a little” to communicate. But after all, even if they didn’t understand what I was asking, they got the “situation” and tried to help me. In Turkey, we sometimes have fun with these “a little English” people who try to explain the route you’ve asked with “Go go go, left, go go, right, go, there”. And I also saw them in Barcelona! After all, I handle everything with them. So, even if you don't know English, you can communicate with them, just show what you want.
Like they don’t speak that much English, they also don’t use English signs. That is also because they use Catalan as their first language and Spanish is the second, so mostly there is no space for an English word. But you can use the city without a foreign language because of their signs! In the metro, you mostly can’t see an English word but with their sign language, you can go wherever you want. For example in Turkey, at the stations we both use Turkish and English announcements and signs. But if you also don’t know English, you will have a hard time. But in Barcelona, they use the line numbers, the line flow, and some good signs to show where to go and where to wait.
I also see those signs at the airport. For example, if you need to do something about tax-free, you need to go to Terminal 1. But our flight was from Terminal 2 and we just looked at that sign and realized we needed to go that way to find our “shuttle”. Also, they put the same sign at the door that we need to go through.
I need to mention another thing if we are talking about the city's accessibility. I saw so many people with wheelchairs and with a walking stick because they couldn’t see. Those people were all alone, there was no one to help them with the lights, sidewalk, or getting in a store. They can do all of these by themselves.
I try to create websites that everyone can “access”, everyone can use it smoothly and feel comfortable as they do these. From now on, I want to make websites like Barcelona! And hope to see it again :).

Collection of reflections and experiences aimed at reimagining our society from an economic, social and environmental point of view

I have been to Barcelona several times, but since the last time it had been 10 years now.
A period in which the city experienced great transformations, socially and aesthetically speaking, related to urban regeneration. Fruit of the work of one mayor in particular, Ada Colau, a “grassroots” activist who brought a breath of new air to the city, and of many other figures who believed in positive change for local communities.
For work reasons, I was in Barcelona for a couple of days, and I took the opportunity for a “regeneration tour” in 24 hours, to understand what has changed in the city and what has unfortunately or fortunately remained the same over time.
I walk out of the hotel in Poblenou where I was staying and already I feel happy. In front of me trees and bushes hide the concrete. No horns or engine noise nearby, just the sound of Barcelona’s typical green parrots. The impact that noise pollution has on us becomes much clearer in these moments, yet we struggle to notice it in our daily lives. I keep walking, imagining what the city would be like if it were full of spaces like this, and what all cities would be like if the gray palette of urbanism…

— -A fruitful ramble — —
Without a plan or map, we landed on the sun-kissed landstrip of Barcelona airport.
The short flight from London seemed like more of a teleport than a form of transport, zapping us from the soupy grey hue of London into a blossoming explosion of vibrant Catalonian colour. The warm embrace of the sun was enough to send spirits soaring as we rushed through Spanish security and emerged into the heat.
Following our landing, we took an airport shuttle (the A1) from Barcelona airport to plazza Espanya, where we proceded to a quick check in at the Ofelias hotel, located just off the impressive Plazza Espanya. A city square packed with the hustle and bustle of everyday Catalonian life, capped with a monumental fountain by Josep Maria Jujol, one of Gaudí’s main associates.
To escape the crowds and the rising heat, we took a short metro ride on the L1 line to the more quieter Gracia borough, a serene district with shaded backstreets, sloping lawns and bohemian cafe culture.
Gracia was as peaceful as expected. A tranquil setback from the initial and intense buzz of the sweaty Plazza Espanya, a welcome oasis.
After a short walk through shaded alleys, we took a seat at one of Gracias shaded restaurants, located on a Gaudi street corner. Gracia’s solace was complimented with a crisp lager Estrella (the first of many) and a crisp white wine.
Time for tapas. Accompanying the drinks were lobster croquets, cured meats, tomato breads and garden olives; all enjoyed under the shady confines of a terraced side street.
After lunch, we pushed on, stumbling down quieter alleyways, cafes, bars but local shops were beginning to close their blinds to the afternoon sun; with a siesta break approaching.
Pastel painted walls dotted the backstreets backstreets, apartments squeezed down leaning alleys, their astute balconies almost brushing the wall opposite, rising high into the Barcelona rooftops.
Small potted plants and foliage spill through each wrought iron balcony, giving the apartments of Barcelona a living and breathing dimension. The gentle tinker of a Spanish guitar escapes through a bedroom window, a picture book setting.
Following more walking, a pot of earl grey tea was enjoyed (alongside some locally baked pastries) in a charming cafe in the fork of Gothic road.
The Gothic region, and the plaza Rela in particular, is a real diamond in the crown of the sprawling alleyways of Barca.
Elaborately crafted window sills, lined with palm trees and gold leafed figureheads brought a touch of regalness to a public square.
As evening drew and the Sun sank ever lower and closer to the sea, we took a short taxi ride towards a mountainside boulevard. Restaurant Martinez awaited…
A meal of sol-fish, grilled aubergine and a refreshing Spanish white was finished with a Catalonia creme brûlée and a quick macchiato on the moonlight terrace.
The iconic glow of the Martinez neon sign trickled onto the seated patio, as the first day in Barcelona drew to a close.
— — A tale of much Tapas — —
The second day of our Barcelona adventure brought a slower pace after the manic rush following landing.
We rose slowly at the boutique and bohemian styled Ofelias Hotel. After enjoying the waterfall shower, we took the glass exposed elevator to the fifth floor, where a slimly discreet terrace pool sat tranquilly under the morning sun.
Hotel Ofelias is located just off plaza Espanya, it’s black awnings cut an abrasive shade over the sidewalk and two large potted plants keep guard on each side of the door.
A gold wrought iron handle signals to pull and inside the lobby, cushioned armchairs, marble floors and floral wallpapers provide a unique but luxurious decor.
The rooms are simple but well designed, a contemporary luxury with a distinctly bohemian feel. A large terrace provides a courtyard to lounge and relax in, the sun certainly had us smiling.
My fiancee Hope particularly enjoyed the sun trap terrace, with its cushioned lounger and small dining table; an ideal spot for an evening glass of wine.
The rooftop terrace pool was bitterly cold but crystal blue and exhilaratingly refreshing. The sun soaked wooden cladding offered a warm recovery from the waters frosty bite. Nevertheless, a cold swim is a great way to start any day in Barcelona.
After the short swim, it was time for lunch. A short walk from Espanya, is a very good independent coffeehouse — Morrow.
Morrow is a typical new wave coffee joint — artisan pastries, organic coffee and minimalist design; a true sign that Barcelona is certainly no museum city but a living and thriving location for the young and prosperous.
Morrow’s sleek interior design, array of artisan sandwiches, fresh coffee and skilled Catalonian baristas make it an obvious choice for a quick break.
A short conversation with the Morrow owners revealed that the coffeehouse is New Zealand inspired, like many of our favourite coffee haunts back in London.
Following a quick lunch of Fauta (thinly sliced sandwich with cured meat), coffee and pastries, in Morrow; we ventured back northwards into Barcelona to see the world famous Sagrada Familia.
Despite its obvious beauty, the Familia cathedral appeared to be under some heavy restoration work; so we didn’t experience it at its finest.
But the Gaudi architecture is really quite something, it’s curves, shapes and edges so clearly inspired by a living, breathing God muse that it’s no wonder that Gaudi is often dubbed as God’s architect.
We enjoyed wonderful ice cream in front of the Sagrada at an independent store called Farggi.
A short walk from Sagrada, through the quieter Gracia district, led to the Gothic Quarter, where we enjoyed a moment drinking short lagers from a chilled press. Lunch was enjoyed on the backstreet lawns of a college campus.
We then took the L3 metro, as the sun was setting, to the wonderfully authentic Bar Canete. A world renowned tapas location…
Here, the waiters fly around yelling impassioned Spanish; golden goblets of freshly drafted Estrella fly around on silver platters, plumes of steam fill the kitchen as clams are steamed; and micro dishes of endless wonderful delicacies are enjoyed by a marvelling crowd.
A truly special spot for dinner and a real must visit on the Barcelona check list…
— — A face sized beer — —
The final day and the sun was still shining. Barcelona in April brings a glorious warmth, not hot and sticky but a gentle and constant shine that fills you with boundless energy and endless optimism.
It’s a delight to simply sit on the warm concrete of the hotel steps, breathing in the Spanish air and reflecting on the past two days.
Another coffee at Morrow. Irresistible. Their sleekly designed paper cups with the black label make for a good snap…
With our departure time looming, we paid a quick visit to the Barcelona beach front.
A busier and more touristy part of town but nonetheless picturesque. The beach front is dotted with hundreds of small bistros, bars and grills; offering food and drinks on the harbour front.
We finished off the day with drinks at Tapa Tapa, where the beers are ridiculously big.
The final metro journey of the weekend took us back to the Plazza Espanya, where we jumped on the A1 bus to the Barcelona Airport.
Gracias, Barcelona!"

As I explored in my assessment of Barcelona’s recent victory over Sevilla, there are signs that Xavi Hernández is doing more than just getting good results. He’s moulding a very accomplished footballing system.
But recently, not everything has been rosy in the era of #XaviBall. After a laborious draw against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, and a narrow victory against Levante that Barca had no right to win, it’s clear that the side is still in its juvenile phase at best.
In particular, it’s suffered against a specific shape and play style. After some analysis, it appears no coincidence that Barca struggles when the opposition plays five defenders.
So having watched some games back, with a keen eye on the tactical nuances, I’ve listed a few key reasons why 5 is an unlucky number for Xavi’s Barcelona.
1.The numerical advantage is lost in buildup
Building up from the goalkeeper, Barcelona have consistently used a 2–3–5 setup. Both full backs go wide, the attacking midfielders are high up the pitch, and the wingers stay wide on either flank. The goal is to make the pitch big, stretch the opposition, and ultimately create space in the wide areas.
Because of the positions of the attacking midfielders, the opposing back four must stay compact. By moving the ball from side to side, Barca can easily find a full back or winger with plenty of space.
And with the centre forward occupying two centre backs, Barca have a free man when the opponents press aggressively.
A back five changes everything
However, when the opposition plays a back five, or three, the man advantage is lost. All of the front players are man-marked, plus the attacking midfielders. Here against Levante, you can see every player, bar the keeper, is accounted for.
Eintracht Frankfurt used a similar idea. But instead of man marking everywhere, they conceded the numerical advantage in the first third of the pitch in order to create their own advantage in the zone Barca loves to attack most: out wide.
The consistent problem here is that the back line cannot be stretched.
With five players defending, both wingers can be marked tightly regardless of where the ball is. No matter how much Barca move the ball looking for space, it will very rarely appear on the flanks.
So how should Barca play out from these scenarios? The answer leads us on to the next problem.
2. Barca’s forwards struggle to hold up the ball
When passing lanes are blocked and the wide players are marked, the emphasis must shift to the centre of the pitch. The most direct solution is to use a ‘third man run’.
This means finding the attacking midfielders indirectly, by going through the centre forward.
The image above is the ideal scenario. Aubameyang makes a run deep and has Pedri in support, who has also peeled off his marker — one of the centre backs. This is the benefit of having the attacking midfielders high and wide.
The theory is easy, the execution not so much. And Aubameyang has been having a torrid time recently trying to hold the ball up.
Unfortunately, neither Dembélé or Ferran Torres are particularly adept at doing this either (á la Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane). This makes a man-for-man approach very appealing for the opposition.
To summarise so far: a back five nullifies Plan A (to create space out wide), and forces Plan B (go direct into the forwards), which simply hasn’t been fruitful. And perhaps not suited to the current personnel.
So what’s Plan C? Well, here’s the third problem:
3. The system is too rigid
Or, in other words, there is no Plan C. And that’s understandable.
Xavi has modernised the way Barcelona play. It’s not an understatement, after the mediocrity of several managers (that won’t be named), to say that players have had to ‘re-learn’ the game. At least with regards to understanding positioning and movement.
With that in mind, and with the players taking on a new system, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they haven’t yet mastered the next stage: improvisation.
Because improvisation is key when Plan A and B don’t work. That, and a lot of quality.
I’m talking particularly about fluidity of role and movement. Manchester City are the kings of this. Despite having a very defined idea of how to attack, the players interchange positions and responsibilities effortlessly.
We got a glimpse of this in the second half against Levante, as Gavi and Pedri came on and introduced an element of unpredictability. Especially the former, who did something no other midfielder had even attempted: dribble past his marker.
This characteristic, fluidity, should quite naturally mature and evolve with time. It’s reasonable that this is a work in progress.
However, my final point is perhaps more concerning. Especially in the face of some big games before the end of the season:
4. Nobody is marking the wingbacks
If there’s one flaw that everyone has realised, it’s that Barca’s biggest weakness is their defensive transition.
Two of the reasons for this have been touched on already:
The first: the loss of possession through the centre forward. With wingers high and wide, and attacking midfielders supporting, Barca can be very short on numbers in transition. Busquets and Pique become especially exposed due to their lack of pace.
The second: Jordi Alba drifts wide. Usually, Barcelona try to prevent counter-attacks with a 2–3 shape that remains behind the ball. But when Jordi Alba, the leftmost of the ‘3’ breaks beyond the ball, this shape is broken and opposing forwards exploit the space.
The third reason is specific to the five-man backline. You can see it materialising in the image above, in the bottom right corner of the image. It’s the opposition wingback.
Against Frankfurt especially, it was clear Barca’s wingers were not instructed to track back. With the entire backline occupied by forwards, these marauding wingbacks created overloads time and again.
It was the same story against Levante, who should have made much more of their numerous overloads.
And so while Barcelona and Xavi have spent much of these first few months tweaking the offensive setup, more caution will need to be paid to this type of counter attack. Fortunately, the tactical solution seems easy enough: players work harder to get back.
Whether anything more can be done about it (aside from making tactical fouls) remains to be seen.
Despite everything I’ve highlighted, things still look overwhelmingly positive for Barcelona. The speed in which Xavi has implemented his system, and the players have understood it, is credit to his coaching ability.
However, this project is still a work-in-progress. Come the summer, personnel will change, the squad will look different, and things will evolve again. Whether Xavi can fix these problems problems immediately will be a big test of his managerial prowess. But based on his record so far, I wouldn’t bet against him.

Greetings, football enthusiasts! Today, I’m taking you on a timeless journey through one of FC Barcelona’s unforgettable nights. Join me to discover the magic that unfolded in the clash against Chelsea (2009), a night engraved in the annals of football history.
“Each second felt like an eternity”
The story begins in a hub of pure excitement. Chelsea already led 1-0, and Barça faced a mountain to climb. At that time, as a 12-year-old schoolboy, I returned from school with indescribable excitement. I couldn’t wait to see how my heroes would tackle this colossal challenge.
I remember sticking to the TV, still wearing my school uniform, eagerly anticipating the spectacle. It was more than just a match for me; it was an immersive experience, a magical interlude in my adolescence.
As the match progressed, stress mounted. Every whistle, every pause in play, everything seemed to decide Barça’s fate. My heart raced; each second felt like an eternity.
Then came the 93rd minute, a moment etched in my mind. Andrés Iniesta, the football genius, triggered an explosion of emotions. I remember leaping with joy, unable to contain the excitement. It was a moment of deliverance, where football transcended the sport to become a pure emotional experience.
Let’s be honest—beyond the scoreboard, there were refereeing decisions that could have altered the narrative. As a fan, I couldn’t help but acknowledge the whims of fate. Football, with its imperfections, added to the drama of that unforgettable night.
Ultimately, beyond the scoreboard, it was a fan’s journey—a roller coaster of emotions, from doubt to belief, from anxiety to jubilation. Join me next time to relive other unforgettable football moments.
Don’t forget to subscribe, and share your own stories in the comments. Until next time, keep the football spirit alive!
This is Stanley,

Barcelona was never on my radar as a place to visit, let alone move to. In 2024, nearly 12 million tourists visited this city, which is now my home. After four and a half years as a resident, I’ve seen its good and its bad, but moving here has still been my best big life decision, and I’ve made more than my fair share of bad ones.
Before you question, “I wonder what it’s like to be an American expat living in Barcelona,” let me make something perfectly clear. I identify as an immigrant. Expats, in my opinion, have large sums of disposable income, something I do not have.
My decision to move here had nothing to do with its beautiful architecture, fabulous food, and comfortable climate. I moved here because, while visiting Tuva, a small Siberian republic in the Russian Federation that shares a border with Mongolia, for a third time, I met a woman there who happened to live in Barcelona. What started as a friendship turned into a romance, and after several visits to see her, I took the dive into the deep end of the pool and eventually moved here permanently.
Anything worth doing usually has a few bumps in the road, and my decision to move to Barcelona was hit with a huge one. Three days before my flight from New York to Barcelona, the pandemic shut the world’s borders…

When I first arrived in Barcelona, I was wide-eyed and clumsy — like a tourist trying too hard not to look like one. I’d been dreaming of Gaudí facades, sangria by the beach, and a Mediterranean lifestyle full of late dinners and even later conversations. What I didn’t anticipate was how long it would take to actually feel like I belonged.
Here’s what I learned — sometimes the hard way — about blending in with locals in this magnetic, complex city.
1. Start with “Bon dia,” not “Hola”
I knew Spanish (Castellano), but I quickly discovered that Catalan is everywhere — on street signs, in supermarkets, and yes, in everyday greetings. Saying bon dia (good morning) instead of hola showed respect for the local culture. No one expected me to be fluent in Catalan, but trying a few words — si us plau (please), gràcies (thank you) — opened a lot of doors, literally and figuratively.
Tip: Download a basic Catalan phrasebook or app. Just trying a few phrases goes a long way.
2. Eat when they eat, not when you’re hungry
I once sat down for dinner at 7:00 PM and got a confused look from the waiter. In Barcelona, lunch is at 2 PM, and dinner doesn’t start until at least 9 PM. Adapting to this schedule was challenging at first (especially with my American stomach), but it helped me sync with the rhythm of the city.
Tip: Join the menú del día (menu of the day) crowd at lunchtime. It’s affordable, filling, and a great way to observe locals in their natural habitat.
3. Dress the part, subtly
Barcelona style is chic but effortless. Locals somehow make sneakers look elegant and never seem overdressed or underdressed. I learned the hard way when I showed up to a casual dinner in flip-flops and got side-eyes from every direction.
Tip: Leave the touristy sandals and loud prints at home. A well-fitted tee, stylish sneakers, and a light jacket can help you blend in instantly.
4. Embrace vermouth culture
I didn’t expect vermouth to become part of my weekend ritual, but “fer el vermut” (having a vermouth) before lunch on weekends is a sacred tradition. It’s not about getting tipsy — it’s about slowing down, snacking on olives, and chatting with friends for hours.
Tip: Go to a neighborhood bodega on a Sunday around noon. Order a vermut negre and some anchovies. Just sit, sip, and soak it in.
5. Avoid La Rambla — except at 5 a.m.
Everyone goes to La Rambla once. But locals? They avoid it like the plague — unless they’re walking home after a night out. If you want to see the real Barcelona, head to neighborhoods like Gràcia, Sant Antoni, or Poblenou.
Tip: Wander into the smaller plazas at night. You’ll find kids playing soccer, couples drinking wine on benches, and old men arguing about Barça. That’s the magic.
6. Be a regular
One of the best decisions I made was committing to a local café. I went every day, even if it was just for a cortado. Eventually, the barista started greeting me by name, and I was invited to a neighborhood calçotada (a Catalan barbecue). That’s when I knew I was more than just a visitor.
Tip: Pick a small bar, café, or shop near where you live. Consistency breeds community.
7. Understand the pride — and pain — of Catalan identity
Conversations about identity, politics, and language run deep here. I learned early on not to assume Spain = Catalonia. People here have a distinct sense of self, and respecting that nuance showed I wasn’t just another tourist trying to “do Spain in a week.”
Tip: Listen more than you talk. Ask questions, and stay curious. You’ll gain trust.
Final Thoughts
Blending in doesn’t mean pretending to be local — it means respecting the flow, showing genuine interest, and participating instead of spectating. Barcelona rewards patience and presence. It taught me to slow down, look around, and become part of the scenery.
I came to Barcelona with a suitcase and a guidebook. I stayed because of the people who welcomed me when I finally stopped trying so hard — and just started being.

As an avid traveller, I’m always searching for the heart of a city, that unique pulse that goes beyond the typical tourist trail. In Barcelona, I found it not just in the architectural wonders, but within the hallowed walls of Camp Nou.
While I didn’t get to witness the electrifying energy of a live match, the tour of FC Barcelona’s legendary stadium was an experience in itself. From the moment I approached the colossal structure, I felt the weight of football history. Camp Nou isn’t just a stadium its mesmerising almost feeling hypnotised.
Walking through the stadium, I could almost hear the echoes of roaring crowds and the legendary players who graced that pitch. The sheer scale of the place is breath taking. Standing on the side lines, imagining the thrill of a packed stadium, gave me goose bumps. Visiting the changing rooms, walking through the tunnel the players use, and seeing the press box all provided a unique perspective.
The museum offered a fascinating glimpse into the club’s rich history, showcasing trophies, iconic jerseys, and the stories behind Barcelona’s greatest moments. It’s a testament to the club’s legacy and its deep connection to the city.
Even without a match, Camp Nou vibrated with an almost palpable energy. It’s a place where passion and history collide. To top it all off, the tour concluded with a truly immersive 360-degree cinematic experience ( link at the top of this article make sure to watch it), putting me right in the heart of the action with all the legendary players. It was an incredible way to feel the pulse of the team. This entire experience gave me a deeper understanding of Barcelona, a city where football is more than just a sport; it’s an integral part of the culture.
So, if you’re visiting Barcelona, make sure to add Camp Nou to your itinerary. Whether you’re a die-hard football fan or simply curious, a tour of this iconic stadium is an unforgettable experience. It’s a chance to connect with the soul of the city and understand why football is so much more than just a game.

Earlier in 2023, I thought of fulfilling my wanderlust and taking off on a solo trip in Europe — something my younger self wouldn’t have even dreamed of.
In my attempt to live in the present (coupled with my habit of tardily posting photos), I felt it was important to journal my experiences to capture my raw thoughts and feelings while I travel.
I’m glad I wrote them as it took me months to finally get around to sharing my travel stories, but here we go.
Barcelona, Spain || June 2023
I am on my way to the airport as I started writing this.
A few days ago, I flew to Spain to begin the first leg of my solo trip around Europe. There’s no deeper reason why I’m taking this trip except I know that, whatever the outcome is, I need to do it and it will reveal its beautiful purpose in time.
It’s too early to write my reflections about my experience, and there is definitely so much to be written. But, I’m about to fly out of Spain today to my next destination, and I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by the kindness around me, especially that I am far from home.
From that metro guy who brought out his phone to use Google Translate so he could better give me instructions,
that other passenger who help me carry my luggage upstairs because I didn’t know you can go around and maybe find a lift,
that guy from Albania on a holiday who walked me to the bus stop ‘coz I’ve been literally going circles, looking for my ride to my hostel,
that guy from Germany, who was also on a holiday, but who explained the route of the bus I took to assure me and who also made suggestions on what touristy things I should do,
my roommates from Egypt, Brazil, and Chile who already feel like long-time friends, offering help and suggesting to meet up again in my next destinations,
Viki from Hungary, who provided me company on my first day, sharing stories as well as the same love for sports and dogs,
Mary Margaret from the US, who helped me book a tour and let me pay her in cash because my card wouldn’t work for online purchases because of its registered local number,
Miquel, a true blue Catalan from Esparreguera who adjusted his sched so I could go hiking in Montserrat — the reason why I added Barcelona to this trip,
all the fellow tourists and travelers who offered to take my photo (regardless if they turned out good shots or not) because I was alone,
the Spanish girl who lives near my hostel who taught me the best way to the airport,
David, a guy from Slovenia who works at the hostel, who gleefully (but not sure if legally) offered to keep my luggage and carry-on bag at the storage room free of charge for two days,
the ladies at the buses and the metro who weren’t articulate in English but still entertained my questions and went out of their way so we could find the lift for my heavy luggage,
the guy on the wheelchair, who was, of course, an expert to accessing the elevators, who kept on reminding me not to ride the train that runs through the same line as the train to the airport,
the Spanish girl who sat closer to my luggage at the airport terminal when I had to leave and check my flight details on the screen, and who then told me where to find assistance.
I have been just less than a week away, and I have many people to thank for — especially my family. But let me start with these strangers. I hope I got to know all their names and keep communication, but it warms my heart to think that even strangers can play magical cameos in anyone’s life.
When I arrived in Spain, I knew that getting lost should be enjoyed just as much as getting to one’s destination in a breeze. And true enough, I got lost, I doubted my direction and decisions multiple times, but I survive, learning lessons and making memories.
I am about to leave Spain, convinced that the world is beautiful. Yes, because Barcelona and Catalonia are a sight to behold. But more so, because of the kindness all around us.

When we talk about football clubs, Spanish football clubs, especially FC Barcelona, come to mind. FC Barcelona has emerged as one of the biggest and most renowned football clubs in the world. Let’s take a journey into the development of FC Barcelona and how they have continuously adapted to the demands of the times.
FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by Joan Gamper and has since become an important part of Barcelona’s culture and history. FC Barcelona shares a strong connection with Catalonia, as it has emerged as a rallying point for Catalan identity, providing a platform for the expression of Catalan aspirations. The club’s motto, “Mes que un club” (More than a club), reflects its social, cultural, and political impact. This identity has evolved over time, solidifying the club as a symbol of resistance and Catalan identity.
One of the most visible aspects of FC Barcelona is their playing style. They embrace a philosophy of beautiful football and ball dominance, known as “tiki-taka.” This style of play is a developed and perfected version of “Total Football” popularized by former Barcelona manager, Johan Cruyff. Cruyff’s influence and tactical approach laid the foundation of FC Barcelona’s philosophy.
Later, under the guidance of coaches Louis van Gaal and especially Pep Guardiola, FC Barcelona refined and implemented the tiki-taka style to its fullest potential. Guardiola played a significant role in promoting and developing “tiki-taka” during his successful tenure as Barcelona’s head coach from 2008 to 2012, collecting 14 major trophies.
The development of FC Barcelona is not limited to their playing style. They have also strengthened their youth player development structure and established the renowned football academy, La Masia. In recent years, Barcelona has also enhanced their approach to using technology and data analysis to improve team performance. They are currently renovating their stadium, now called Spotify Camp Nou.
FC Barcelona’s development is also reflected in their history of success. The club has won numerous domestic and international titles, including La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. They have had star players like Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, and many more who have become symbols of Barcelona’s dominance.
FC Barcelona has undergone a remarkable evolution over time, both in terms of playing style and as a social institution. The combination of visionary coaching, skilled players, and a commitment to the club’s philosophy led to the mastery of tiki-taka at Barcelona. They continuously adapt to the changing times and follow the path of remarkable development. FC Barcelona is not just a football club; it is a symbol of spirit, identity, and values that define them, just like their motto, “Mes Que Un Club” (More Than a Club).

🚧 ConsSalaries lower than other European citiesLots of paperwork for visa/residency in SpanishFlat-hunt can be a challenge
If you are up for reading the long part, we have🤔 Why Barcelona💬 Interview Process📑 Spain Visa🏦 Working in N26🏠 Flat-scene & Utility Bills🥘 Food💸 Budget☎️ Language👯‍♀️ Friends and Indian Community💔 Pandemic☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona
If you followed along, I had decided quite early I wanted to rent a studio apartment in Paris and live there as an adult. After graduation, and while working in Bangalore, I was looking for reasons to travel or move abroad as my weekend side project.
With my experience and profile, I figured I should diversify my options. So I applied to a lot of places for jobs — Ottawa, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, New York (yes yes I know how impossible the US visa situation is!). I was pretty much open to any city for the experience!
I had applied to an N26 opening that had Berlin/Barcelona/Vienna mentioned. During one of the interviews, the recruiter mentioned I was being considered for the Barcelona office.
Recruiter: “So what do you think Chhavi?”
The open-source community I contributed to back in college, had roots in Barcelona. I had visited Barcelona before twice and had absolutely loved it. I had tagged it as “my city” pretty much on the first visit. I was always super grateful to be in Barcelona, but never thought I could ever live there. It just never crossed my mind.🙃
The recruiter stared back at me through the zoom call.
Me: “I love Barcelona!”
A friend of a friend used N26, and he mentioned it to me. Mobile banks were still a new concept to me, so I did a little bit of research. A quick Google search listed all of these fin-tech darlings — Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26.
I found a mutual on LinkedIn and requested a referral. I saw on LinkedIn that they had a few folks from India, so I thought maybe…maybe they do sponsor visas. Long haul, but worth a shot. I waited for a bit and heard back from a recruiter 2–3 weeks later.
I was super excited to make it to the interviews. The “funnel” is so dramatic when you apply abroad — that this feels like an achievement. First I ordered and ate a lot of ice cream through Swiggy. Then I spent a lot of time preparing. More on this in part 1.
chhavii.medium.com
1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.2. Design Exercise. I was asked to design a mobile application for reading curated books.3. Video-call to discuss the Design Exercise. My first chance to interacting with product designers on the team. We talked about the exercise, about the team, and in general how I could contribute.4.Video-call with a Product Manager and a Product Designer. Here we talked more about product thinking, our take on MVPs, using data, making trade-offs, and working as a cross-functional team. 5. Video-call with Head of Design. We talked about my career aspirations, how they see the team growing, how I could contribute, and on giving back to the design community and making the product more inclusive.
1. N26 was looking for someone with my level of experience. Most of the times it’s not you. It’s just about what the team needs right now.
2. N26 was building a truly international company, hence was open to sponsoring visas.
3. The extra effort I had put to balance out my years of experience — I had prepared an analysis of the N26 app, and the ways I could contribute to the team.
The whole process felt pretty organic and I think took around a month. The part that was the biggest selling point for me was the people I talked with. I found all of them super respectful, and great listeners. We talked a lot about how they see the team growing, and how I could add to it. In hindsight, these conversations were such a strong indicator of why the team would be perfect for what I was looking for!
My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!
It wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.
My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.
N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.
The process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.
I had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.
Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!
Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️
On workWe worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.
It was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.
I also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.
The office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!
On design teamWe call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.
We had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.
Honestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.
Side note: I will share some more pictures on my Instagram stories here.
This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃
You cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.
Barcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.
My first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).
I had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.
I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩
At one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳
We could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.
It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀
Again, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the Menu del Dia — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!
I also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s ras malai.
It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂
A rough breakdown of my monthly budgetRent — 650 EurosUtility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)Groceries — 200ishTransport — 50ishTravel (pre-covid) — 400ish
Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!
I took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.
Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.
I had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)
I am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!
It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.
I remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.
I was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.
I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.
Even though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.
I sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.
I would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!

A personal reflection on the unexpected, hours-long power outage that left Spain and parts of two other countries in the dark.
It’s been four days since the blackout. Though I took plenty of notes on the day itself, it wasn’t until I read someone else’s reflection that I felt moved to write my own.
It all began around 10:30 a.m. I’d just finished a call with two teammates, where we broke down a large epic into smaller user stories for the next day’s refinement session. That meeting had been one of my main focuses — finalizing those stories would free up my time later in the week while the development team started the development of those tasks.
The night before, a quiet Sunday, I’d gone to bed early. Lying there, I mentally outlined my week. Writing those stories was at the top of my Monday to-do list. So, after the meeting, I grabbed my draft notes and a glass of water, ready for a deep-focus session. But Jira wasn’t updating. My Wi-Fi had disconnected. Odd, but not entirely unusual, as my home connection can be temperamental.
I went to the kitchen. The room felt strangely dark, so I reached for the light switch. Nothing. That’s when I realised the electricity was out.
Our neighbour has been doing construction work for months, so my first assumption was that they’d accidentally cut a line. I stepped outside and asked,“Excuse me, I noticed I have no electricity. Are you working on anything that might’ve caused it?”“It’s not just you,” he said. “The whole street’s out.”
Strange. A few months back, a nearby building caught fire, and we briefly lost power, but this felt different. I still had mobile data, so I messaged my team to let them know I was offline trying to figure it out what was going home with power at home. One colleague replied, saying he’d also lost power, and he lives far from me. I wrote back:“Hey, is this happening across Barcelona?”He responded: “I have friends in Badalona and Madrid going through the same.”
Just then, my partner arrived from the gym. Before I could say anything, he told me he’d stopped by the supermarket but couldn’t buy anything, no electricity, no card payments.
My thoughts began racing. Was this just local? A regional outage? I checked the news: barely two or three headlines. No one knew the cause yet.
I decided to stay calm and wait for a few more minutes. I was constantly checking the WiFi to see if there were any chances of it being back yet.
I tried calling a friend. The connection was poor, but her voice crackled through:“It’s horrible, isn’t it? I can’t hear you well.” She mentioned GPS was still working, so she was heading home, adjusting to her new commute after recently moving.
She was okay but had to hang up, her husband was calling from Vilanova i la Geltrú. That made me pause. A colleague had mentioned Madrid, but the news hadn’t confirmed anything. If her husband in Vilanova was calling about the blackout, this wouldn’t normalise in only a few minutes, it was spreading. Or already had.
I checked in with my partner. He seemed calm, which made me second-guess my own growing anxiety. I appreciated his steadiness, but the total lack of urgency worried me too. He began messaging friends using mobile data. Some confirmed that France wasn’t affected, but Sitges was also out. Could this be a cyberattack?
By now, I’d lost mobile signal entirely.
I opened the fridge: bare. We had enough leftover for maybe a day. Living in the city center, we usually buy fresh groceries daily. No need to stockpile.
My partner saw the look on my face and began filling some water bottles. I checked our cupboards: some rice, a bit of pasta, not much more than that. Thankfully, we had a gas cooktop. I rummaged for cash: around €20 in a jar of travel coins, another €30 in my wallet. That would have to do.
But what to buy? Some food for today and tomorrow, of course, but besides that? What was I preparing for?
A few weeks ago, I’d bought a pack of 100 candles for my night routines, reading and journaling by candlelight. At least we were set for lighting. I praised myself for that. We debated how to get updates. Would a radio be too much? Were we overreacting?
I reminded myself this wasn’t local. Multiple cities were affected. We decided to go out and see how the neighbourhood was coping.
Around 1:20 PM. We took the stairs, five flights down, in pitch black. No emergency lights. I won’t lie, that terrified me. I regretted not calling my family in Brazil before losing signal.
Outside, neighbours were talking, but no one had answers. We walked around the neighbourhood. Major supermarkets like Ametller and Caprabo were closed. Corner stores were open, with lines forming outside. People were buying toilet paper, water, radios and candles.
2:30 PM. At one building entrance, a doorman said their power was back. Ours still wasn’t. Why would some buildings have power while others didn’t? I assumed hospitals had generators, but what about regular residential buildings?
Being outside helped. I felt calmer even though the streets were not still. Public transport had stopped: the train, tram, and metro. Only buses were still running, and that’s why the lines were getting stupidly longer. People looked stressed, overchecking their phones, but frustrated with the lack of signal.
From another perspective, there were still some people sunbathing, while others drank beer on terraces. Some kind of Woodstock in the middle of an apocalypse?
We skipped the long queues and wandered further until we found a small store with no line. We bought canned beans and pasta, enough for today and tomorrow.
At the entrance, a woman was controlling how many people entered. Inside, it was dark. They were using flashlights and calculators, only accepting cash. It felt surreal.
Around 3:00 PM. We noticed a few places still had power, including a small café near Sagrada Familia, and the hospital of course. But most of the city was still out. The ATMS in our way were offline. There was a single one close to a hospital that had a huge line; we considered entering it, but decided not to; we still had a small amount of money after the groceries.
Back home, we climbed the stairs again. We had food. Water. Candles. We decided not to buy the radio, and only wait until later that night or even tomorrow. There wasn’t much more we could do.
I lay on the sofa and finally finished a book I’d started a month ago. My partner opened an old box he hadn’t touched in a year and started organising it.
Later, we talked. Made theories. What would we do in another lockdown? Would we stay in the city or move to the countryside? Buy a car? Rent first? For how long? Just possibilities. Playing out with that amount of extra time we suddenly gained for our Monday, together, in the quiet.
We cooked. We ate. It was still early.
The power had gone out at 10:30 a.m. It wouldn’t come back until nightfall. At 9:30 p.m I was in bed, calming down the nerves of that day and expecting that life would be back to normal in the morning.
I woke up at night, not exactly at what time, and noticed one light from the living was on. I didn’t do the effort to go and turn it off. Somehow it helped me to feel safe.
That day reminded me how little we control, and how much we take for granted. The ability to cook. To call loved ones. To pay for food. To know what’s happening in the world. It was all suspended.
It’s been four days since the episode. There is still no conclusions on what might have caused the European Blackout.
In the stillness of the power outage, something became clear: maybe we do need to prepare ourselves better for unknowns, not with panic, but with presence, healthy discussions, and perspective. Some things are really just out of our control. Important time to think on how we’ve been connected – or not – to the world around us.
In any case, I always knew those 100 candles would come in handy.
If you found this story meaningful or have questions about what happened that day, I’d love to hear from you. Drop a comment — I’m happy to share more.

Barcelona 2023/24— The end to Xavi’s successful but complicated stint.,https://medium.com/@Am10talk/barcelona-2023-24-the-distasteful-end-to-xavis-successful-era-48e41063687e,"Sign up

On November 6th 2021, Xavi Hernández Creus, one of Barcelona’s biggest legends and best midfielders ever, was appointed as the manager of FC Barcelona following the sacking of previous manager and club legend, Ronald Koeman — after a run of poor results, caused by the lack of identity and dynamism in football, that led to Barcelona being 9th on the La-Liga table when he was relieved of his said duties.
Xavi took the same team, with a couple of reinforcements in the following January transfer window of 2022, took the same team to 2nd place with an impressive period — playing some fluid and entertaining football, and also beating Real Madrid 4–0 in the process, ensuring the first El Clasico win since Ernesto Valverde’s departure.
The football witnessed initially under Xavi seemed very refreshing to a fanbase that had witnessed consistently underwhelming seasons of football prior to this — which prompted hyperbolic conversations regarding him being the ‘2nd coming of Pep Guardiola’.
He instilled an identity — provided a tactical foundation to a squad that lacked it very much; he deployed a 4–3–3, a more direct version than the conventional Barcelona style, but an entertaining and fluid style due to how the players inter-connected and understood their environment, which declined overtime due to the departures of some of the key ‘connectors’.
The following season (2022/23) — Barcelona proceeded to win La-Liga and the Spanish Super Cup very convincingly. Barcelona opted to play the box-midfield (midfield of 4) gradually as the season passed by, which helped neuter some of Barcelona’s core issues in the league, but were again exposed in some of the European nights (like Manchester United, Inter Milan).
Although Barcelona suffered a UCL group stage exit that season, the feelings around Xavi’s future / tenure were very positive, especially going into next season. Most seemed convinced that he was Barcelona’s man long-term. But, things went downhill this season with Barcelona’s levels of performance completely regressing while also going trophy-less, overall.
“Signing Xavi Is The Best Decision I’ve Ever Made Since I Became President”
These were the words of Joan Laporta, the Club President in April 2022, and in over 2 years — On 24th May, FC Barcelona announced that Xavi’s last game in charge as manager will be against Sevilla (the last game of the season) and he will not be continuing next season. There’s been such a drastic change in the perception of him as a manager over a year, something must’ve changed, and something did change.
Barcelona’s feelings coming into this season were relatively positive; the aim for this season was clear — an establishment of threat in Europe while maintaining the impressive domestic success we possessed, but did no one see coming this level of regression with regards to our overall style of play, rather than just losing out on trophies due to marginal differences.
Barcelona’s board parted ways with the previous sporting director, Jordi Cruyff (son of Johan Cruyff) and appointed Deco as the new sporting director; The club also parted ways with Mateu Alemany — which, essentially meant there was more responsibility in Yuste’s and Laporta’s hands — which was unhealthy, because neither have the credentials to be holding authority involving them to make sporting decisions.
Now, certain issues seemed to come with the power gradient — there was a lack of respect / consideration with respect to the manager’s decisions / preferences when it came to certain decisions that’d affect the manager the most, like the Vitor Roque situation. No board should sign a player with a manager you’re aiming to keep when he’s insisting against a particular signing, because it becomes unhealthy within the board & for the player’s future, as well.
A few issues became seemingly clear, and primarily, it was the unwarranted amount of influence Jorge Mendes (the agent) possessed on Barcelona’s footballing operations, when in reality — he has no authority to have such grave involvement, and it brings in an inherent level of bias in transfer operations, that could result in Barcelona settling for players with Mendes as agent, despite them being suboptimal for Barcelona’s squad, like the pressure make the Cancelo / Felix deals permanent, the heavy links with Ruben Neves last season etc.
So, in reality, there has always been suboptimal conditions in terms of board structuring and planning that can make it infeasible for managers to succeed at this club, and it was made much worse with the departures of Jordi Cruyff and especially, Mateu Alemany.
The handling of certain situations — including Xavi’s sacking has been extremely poor from the board. Poor treatment of personnel who genuinely commit their all towards the betterment of the club is an attitude that cannot last long at a club such as this, and will / can ultimately lead to the downfall of this particular mandate.
This was a ‘decent’ transfer window considering the financial limitations and there was a good initiative to complete sales of players that weren’t exactly contributing to the club in anyway, anymore. Oriol Romeu seemed like a very good signing at first, but it didn’t go as planned as the season went on due to confidence issues and also primarily — systematic issues that aggregated his flaws and didn’t provide him suitable conditions to succeed.
Felix and Cancelo seemed to be decent reinforcements due to their high technical potential and talent. The issue came with Cancelo’s and Felix’s mental profiles — often ignorant, unwarrantedly complex, reckless, more flair, less effectiveness, which, as expected, led to improper application of their high technical qualities and inconsistent showings in possession, combined with poor showings in general out of possession;
Regardless, Ilkay Gundogan, hands down, proved to be Barcelona’s best signing for this season by a mile. A footballer of the highest level — mentally, physically and technically. He is a true Swiss-Army Knife in every sense of the word due to how versatile, resilient and intelligent he is.
Transfers regarding personnel has been decent at best, but the overall squad planning and direction regarding overall club’s structure has been unconvincing and seems very unsustainable due to the lack of rational basis behind most decisions this particular dispensation has made. Far too ‘individualistic’ and preference-based without looking at the overall larger picture.
Despite current transfer planning / direction being slightly off, the investment in youth for the B team has been pretty impressive, especially under Deco, with signings like Noah Darvich, Ibrahim Diarra and Mikayil Faye. Although, there’s no balance with respect to elevating the 1st team while doing it sustainably on a financial level — hence, the lack of direction and planning I stated.
It’s been a disappointing season overall, from Barcelona, in the tactical domain, on both offensive and defensive fronts. As shown in a graph created by “Markstats” on X :
Barcelona’s deep entries in the opposition graph has massively declined while the opposition deep entries increased as the season progressed. Although, it is very important to note that most teams don’t look to threaten Barcelona through consistent entries / pressure in their box, rather — they use transitions / counter-attacks to try and exploit / attack Barcelona’s defense. But, Barcelona, being a dominant team in possession, in La-Liga, not being able to create enough deep entries, and it going to an extent that it’s not too dissimilar as opposition deep entries suggests poor effectiveness in and, also out of possession.
Barcelona’s issues this season showcase the fact that Xavi is an inexperienced coach with ideas that need proper maturing, multi-dimensionality and clarity in implication. It could, either, be an issue regarding a lack of transcendence of the ideas clearly or a lack of applying these ideas properly, or both — either way, both are co-related mechanisms. Let’s get into some detail.
Barcelona didn’t change much, in terms of their structural base or their formation in terms of positioning. There was a continuation on the 4–3–3 with often one forming a double pivot in build-up, as done last season, except it became more rigid, and horizontal relative to its surroundings. The reasoning is definitely due to Busquets’ departure — which essentially meant that Barcelona needed more dynamism / technical prowess in build-up, without a Busquets.
The replacement came in the form of Romeu, and the build-up responsibility gradually shifted more to Frenkie De Jong with Romeu assisting in build-up. Barcelona seemed ineffective on a consistent basis when it came to enabling effective progression when playing against opposition presses and already seemed to hit some road-blocks regarding fluidity last season, especially in terms of de-compacting opposition defenses (like Inter) but, this season, it got much, much worse.
What seemed to be the issue was — Barcelona had a structural idea in mind, but were incompetent in executing or even understanding how to utilize / implicate the structure to progress efficiently. Barcelona were too rigid / unpredictable, because of an obvious lack in fluidity.
This came due to one major factor, and that’s the DISTANCING. The distances between players became much larger to try and gain positional / numerical advantages, but it came at a cost of compromising for compactness and fluidity.
There was often the lack of an extra receiver between the lines, and instead there was an increased emphasis on playing extremely direct passes which came with the intent of exploiting space that exists, not creating or controlling. This can also be validated by how often Barcelona have to go long to feed runners, or put it on top of defenses to feed runners that does not sustain because it is a high ‘variance’ style and also, an easily readable and predictable style.
It also clearly explains how Pau Cubarsi’s inclusion has made Barcelona much more efficient on the ball — due to his immaculate tactical awareness and manipulation using his body language and footwork which results in creation of gaps / openings of lanes through which Barcelona can find a player better, like how Cubarsi often opens up the middle of the pitch to find Lewandowski directly.
Players do not move in closer proximities to combine, create space and release to the runners. Rather, Barcelona try to do the latter before-hand which is ineffective due to the opposition still maintaining numbers at the back, and the lack of proximity which can undermine the level of reception, and provide a higher risk to the pass.
This showcased the fact that this team had not culminated a set of consistent principles / a basis of automation in possession that would help them play through the opposition and utilize the potential of their structural knowledge into something much more useful and effective.
A conundrum that Barcelona often found themselves is that they were not given the clarity on when to keep the ball, how to keep the ball, and why to keep the ball. What leads to players playing extremely direct passes, and often turning games into chaos is a clear lack of clarity with regards to collective intent, and how to approach the game. That, combined with the larger distances between players, leads to what we call as — over-verticality.
Barcelona have become increasingly rigid in its style of play — a great example being, how often players out wide are completely isolated and have no pathway but to complete their take on, or lose the ball and concede a turnover — which made Balde an easy target to retrieve possession off if Barcelona ever went out wide to him, because he’s not a 1v1 monster; rather, he’s someone that would thrive on more rotations when wide, and more license to carry in the middle — that’s been clearly failed to be addressed due to the high and wide policy of our full-backs in build-up and attacking phases.
The rigidity and lack of fluidity transcends onto why the particular idea of Xavi’s Barcelona are so reliant / obsessed on / with 1v1 dribblers (Yamal / Dembele), and that’s primarily because that’s Barcelona’s only pathway (often) to creating space or progressing out wide due to the lack of rotations, when the whole idea of exploiting said ‘openings’ leads to not much good in the era of modern football due to the increasing amounts of compact defenses — opposition teams are constricting space very well and as often as possible.
There aren’t enough rotations, whether it is deep with the full-backs and midfielders, or whether it’s ahead with the wingers and full-backs. The rigidity prompts individual prowess and spontaneous solution-finding that leads to unreliability / inconsistencies in possession and often a chaotic style against better teams — because the players are playing at their own rhythm, understanding and intent, due to the lack of a collective idea of execution — which shows the lack of a principle base.
The lack of movement has caused Barcelona to become a static and predictable side, lacking basic combinations in possession due to rigid occupation of zones, rather than arrival and exchange of zones between players, often leading to predictable and pointless sideways circulation / forced passes forward to win 2nd balls or over the top of the last line.
The reason Barcelona look much more fluid with Pedri and looked more fluid with Busquets because these two players had a clearer picture of how to progress and play as a collective with the ball — they tried to receive and create shorter distances, dictate movements on the pitch and tried to retain possession when possible, as well.
Their INTENT was / is to extert control on the pitch, which is something Barcelona have massively lacked this season. There’s no quest for territory — that has led to the patchy form this season. Lack of territorial control leads to a game-model with high variance, which is basically, you don’t control enough possibilities to narrow games down to your favour and leave it out more in the open.
This can be validated by some of Barcelona’s poor field tilt statistics against competent opposition :
— Against Athletic Bilbao on March 4th (36.4%) — Against Real Madrid (30.1%) — Against PSG 1st leg (30.0%)
Barcelona play into chaos too much — there is such lack of re-organization for the team to even play in settled possession and when they do, these are the conundrums they face in possession. It’s very unlike a usual Barcelona team, to be honest.
To sum it up — lack of clarity, lack of emphasis on being more risk-averse, controlling and sustaining attacks / pressure has led to an incredibly patchy season, showcasing clear deficiencies with our play-style, despite Barcelona having the personnel to deploy a better style of football with more control, clarity and fluidity.
Barcelona have been very inefficient out-of-possession, and it shows in their massive increase in xGA (Expected Goals) by almost 6 (from 29.7 to 35), from last season. A more leaky defense, something that’s not anticipated from the team who was the best defensive team (on output) in La-Liga last season.
Barcelona’s press has been very lackluster against teams good on the ball. Teams like Girona and Real Madrid have been able to consistently play out of it with ease, and it goes beyond the personnel at the manager’s disposal.
Barcelona do press with a 4–4–2 structure, with often the advanced #8 and Lewandowski leading the front 2. Lewandowski, usually, aims to angle the opposition into playing out towards one flank, but the opposition can often find the free man pretty comfortably against the press, because the center is not compact, at all.
There’s a spacing issue with Barcelona — often, Barcelona find themselves so far apart from each other, that they cannot compact / constrict enough space to restrict their opponents. This is caused due to the extremely rigid man-to-man nature of the press. The players seem to be glued to one player of the opposition team irrespective of rotations / dropping deep that drives Barcelona’s key players out of position and also help teams find the free man with ease using overloads from deep.
(Source : @CaptnGuardiola from X)
This scatters the whole team — which leads to poor spacing and larger distances between each other. This level of complacency and rigidity in a team’s out of possession leads to a very exploitable approach — especially because Barcelona don’t have the highest intensity / dueling capacity, as well.
The last line of defense is also much deeper (out of cautiousness) which means the last line is looking to concede pressure / absorb pressure more than looking to close down / prevent the opposition’s by-passing to further continue until Barcelona’s box — which is one of the main causes of the uneven spacing. There’s also a clear lack of co-ordination on timing / jumps and collective movement when the press is initiated.
It seems very individualistic, with a lack of coherence and each individual with a different intent / approach to the press and that’s the sign of a lack of collective principles instilled; It’s clear that, this is more than just a personnel issue, and there’s an issue with Barcelona’s intent in covering space / the ball, that goes beyond the press.
A team’s ability to adapt to different game-states also depends upon how well-drilled and compact their blocks are. The low / mid blocks have been suboptimal from Barcelona — which, after the PSG games, many would consider a fair assertion.
Multiple games are evidence to this; the distancing between the lines has allowed too much central access to opposing teams BTL. The block tends to be too passive, allowing enough leverage around the box and solely relying on box defending, blocks and clearances.
The shifting leaves many gaps due to the larger distances between players and lack of coherence in intent. The intent in defending as an overall unit seems inherently flawed — too much of being ball-oriented and unnecessarily passive, rather than coverage of space, and compacting of space.
These are the major causes behind Barcelona’s inflation in xGA numbers and also general leakiness and lack of compactness in defense — defensive record being very poor compared to last year.
To sum it up — Barcelona have principle issues with how the football has been played, and that’s because the key enforcers on the pitch have left and we’ve been unable to put the structure to top use with coaching. Spontaneous dictators of play and solution finders like Busquets (mainly), Alba, Dani Alves and Dembele (1v1 prowess) leaving has caused a degradation in style of play due to Barcelona’s style of play, and effectiveness in style of play.
The core issue requires a manager change, unfortunately and that’s because the manager seems to be slightly inexperienced and his ideas on how to execute needs more maturation and learning — which is normal, but it also showcases that Xavi has a high potential if he can reflect on his mistakes, and what he needs to do to coach teams as a collective, better, without enforcers like Busquets.
Despite all the tactical shortcomings, Xavi has shown he is an excellent man-manager and can manage players very well by instilling a level of confidence and trust in them. He’s more than capable of pleasing a dressing room and motivating them, as a coach, and that’s an impressive quality to possess.
Barcelona have appointed Hansi Flick as the new manager, which is a slight philosophical change, but an ambitious and bold one — which only time will tell, if it pays off.
Thank you for reading; if you liked it, I would appreciate as many claps/likes, shares and comments as possible.
Much love, AM.

I recently went on what should’ve been the trip of a lifetime to Barcelona (Spain) and cities Bari, Noci, Aversa, Florence, Caserta, and Naples in Italy.
Like many trips, it was full of mishaps, twists, and surprises. But I ended up learning a lot about many things, myself included, and walked away with valuable lessons and a deeper understanding of what truly matters when exploring the world and reflecting on my own life.
And don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise.
I had initially planned to visit Rome and Pompeii in Italy, but due to time constraints, my friend and I decided to explore nearby cities instead, including Caserta. We toured the Royal Palace of Caserta before catching a train to Florence. We also ventured into lesser-known cities like Bari and Noci and had the chance to experience the vibrant Carnival of Putignano during our stay.
In Barcelona, I omitted places like the Sagrada Familia from my itinerary for several reasons: I hated crowds, was terrified of being pickpocketed, and didn’t want to go just to say I went. Additionally, since it was Ramadan for us Muslims, attending Mass at the Sagrada Familia felt sacrilegious, even if it meant gaining free admission.
Instead, I immersed myself in experiences that were more meaningful to me. I spent most of my time trying out exotic fruits I couldn’t find at home, browsing local grocery stores, learning about racial demographics and local history, talking to locals in Urdu and broken Spanish, researching the Romani people (as known as Gypsies), and studying the architectural details of everyday buildings. I have a particular fixation on doors, so I snapped as many pictures of them as I could as I roamed the city.
And I was perfectly happy doing so.
This is not to say that I didn’t do touristy things. I took a paella-making class in El Raval, where I learned how to make paella, danced around the kitchen, and had enjoyable conversations with people from Moldova, Turkey, Argentina, and the US. I tried tiramisu from every cafe I could. Afterward, I oohed and aahed at paintings in the Picasso Museum, marveled at the World Culture Museum artifacts, got lost on my way to the Chocolate Museum, and pondered the different tastes of Coca-Cola in Europe and the US at a cafe. And I shopped till I dropped, with bags full of spices, magnets, postcards, keychains, and chocolates from La Rambla.
Truthfully, I did feel guilty about “wasting” my trip. The voice in my head shamed me, telling me, “What’s the point of flying all the way here if you don’t check out Park Guell and the other tourist spots?”
But I listened to my body — my anxiety — which was screaming to be heard and decided to conserve my energy for another day of exploration. Instead of pushing my feet to walk the scenic mile home at peak traffic hour, I opted for an Uber, where I enjoyed pleasant conversation with the driver and saved my aching feet from further torment.
It’s not to say I played it completely safe.
Despite being told to avoid El Raval in Barcelona, I ventured there to check out vintage clothing boutiques, satisfy my homesick cravings for Pakistani foods, and buy custard apples. On the way, I went into a Pakistani jewelry store where I bought earrings for upcoming weddings and spoke to the kind store owner in Urdu. She was more than happy to discuss her son’s engagement drama and gave me a discount and free earrings. I wandered alone in the evenings, avoiding the dark alleys and blending in with a tourist group, and enjoyed the city lights. It was a peaceful way to enjoy the city’s vibrant lights and grew my confidence in solo travel.
They say travel broadens the mind and sheds light on the true nature of friendship. During this trip, I was lucky enough to experience both.
In Naples, I reunited with my high school bestie, who went above and beyond to ensure I had the best trip possible. She planned most of our itinerary, booked us a stay at a beautiful old apartment in Noci as a surprise for me, handled our high-speed train tickets for Florence, drove me around everywhere I needed to be, and indulged my constant whims for tiramisu. When it became clear that Italian food wasn’t meant for me, we loaded up on groceries and decided to cook paella at home, where we laughed, sang, and enjoyed one another’s company as we did so.
She also offered me the best of what she had — the master bedroom in her home, her nicest jackets, and the choice of going to Rome or Florence, Bari or Materra. She didn’t want me to pay for anything, but I insisted anyway because, despite the many problems in the way I was parented, one thing I was taught was never to take advantage of anyone’s kindness.
Our parting was more bitter than sweet. Despite doing almost nothing on my travel to-do list, the permeating odor of rotting garbage on the streets, and the death-defying traffic, I had the time (and the best tiramisu) of my life in Naples, the “trash can” of Italy, and couldn’t wait to come back and explore everything else.
Fast forward to Barcelona, where nearly every interaction with my other friend was wrought with tension, resentment, and impatience.
She nitpicked everything I did and said, walked ahead without stopping to wait for me, and made it clear that she didn’t want me around. She also claimed the nice double room in our Airbnb and had me choose between two closet-sized rooms so she could use the remaining room as her closet. I put my foot down and voiced my disapproval, where she eventually relented but gave me the silent treatment for the next couple of days. Despite my initial reluctance to explore alone, I braved my fears instead of putting up with my friend’s rudeness. To socialize, I called friends and family in the US and talked to them for hours. As miserable as I felt, I was touched that many people back home were rooting for me to have a great time in Europe.
Needless to say, this “friend” and I have parted ways, and I realized how disrespected and dismissed I felt in our friendship, as well as the many insults and snide remarks I overlooked throughout our time together.
Piggybacking on my previous point, we didn’t have the nicest lodging. It was clean, in the Sant Antoni neighborhood, surrounded by many things to do. And affordable. You do pay for what you get, especially for AirBnBs.
Our AirBnB had one double room, two single rooms, and no laundry services (despite them being advertised) or microwave. Our AirBnB hosts also failed to mention that there were no elevators in the building and that the walls were very thin. The beds in our rooms were hard and we woke up with sore, stiff backs every morning. The AC unit often turned on when it wanted to and I sweated right through my bedsheets at night.
It wasn’t an entirely bad place to be. Still, I would’ve appreciated an actual dryer machine instead of relying on the unreliable solar-powered clothes dryer on the terrace. And neighbors who were less vocal in their babymaking.
In several cities across Italy and in Barcelona, I quickly became a target for street vendors who could spot me as a tourist from a mile away. At first, I indulged them, buying a few gifts for my family back home. But the problem arose when I started being followed out of shops and booths, bombarded with pleas to “buy this” and “buy that,” often accompanied by sob stories about being an immigrant in a foreign country with large families to feed.
I get it — trust me, I do. As a former people-pleaser, I understand the urge to help. Most people-pleasers are empaths who want to save the world and make life better for the less fortunate.
But let’s be clear: traveling isn’t the way to fix everything wrong with the world. Europe is full of scammers and hustlers who won’t hesitate to overcharge you for something you could easily buy for a couple of euros at the local bodega. Learn to recognize the red flags. If someone is overly pushy or offers you something “for free” on the street, respond firmly with a resounding “NO!” Don’t worry about being rude — nice people make easy targets.
If you do want to tap into your empathetic side, try supporting local small businesses rather than money-laundering souvenir shops or tourist traps. Take the time to learn about the culture around you, try exotic fruits and vegetables, and always assert your boundaries.
Travel is one of those rare situations where I genuinely appreciate my resting bitch face. If you’re a soft-spoken people-pleaser like I used to be, one of my best tips is to put on a serious resting bitch face. It may be hard if you weren’t born with one, but trust me — this facial expression helped me ward off scammers, pickpockets, and hustlers. It also made saying “no” a whole lot easier. People tend to leave you alone when they think you look like someone who won’t tolerate their bullshit.
If mastering a resting bitch face feels impossible, at least look like you know where you’re going. Project confidence. Don’t act shifty; whatever youdo, don’t pull out your GPS in the middle of a sketchy area. If you need to check your phone, step into a store and ask the shopkeeper for directions.
If you’re from a country where seasoning is a way of life, like I am, you might find most European food a bit lackluster. Your best bet is to seek out Latin American or Asian restaurants or bring your spices as you explore.
I’m a huge fan of what Americans consider Italian food. When I was in Italy, I expected the food to be mind-blowing. Instead, I was met with disappointment. I found the dishes surprisingly underseasoned, missing the bold flavors I was used to in the US. For example, the pizzas I ate felt like they were missing key ingredients — salt, dried red chili pepper, and garlic powder. The carbonara at the cute local diner was far from the creamy indulgence I knew and loved in the States. Even the curry chicken pasta tasted like it was seasoned with nothing more than a Maggi instant noodle packet. For a foodie like me, it was almost heartbreaking.
Barcelona had a much better food scene, but by then, the damage was already done.
Despite the confusion, panic, and disappointment I encountered during my trip, I still had an unforgettable time. If anything, I’d happily redo my Barcelona trip knowing what I know now. Along the way, I’ve learned to embrace spontaneity, find joy in the unexpected, and trust in the good people I know. I also learned not to question the blessings that come my way — like the $150 I saved in baggage fees thanks to the kindness of airport staff in Europe. My ability to appreciate life’s simple pleasures — like admiring doors, staircases, and the frames surrounding iconic artworks — turned out to be the perfect way to ground myself amid the chaos.

Riqui Puig was supposed to be the chosen one.
He arose from a truly desperate era for Barcelona, one of sporting failure and institutional turmoil. A squad bloated with miscalculated signings, a board involved in criminal activity, and a team utterly reliant on the powers of Lionel Messi.
And yet, despite that mayhem, Riqui emerged. And he shone brightly.
“It’s a spectacle to watch players like him play,” said former AC Milan Coach, Gennaro Gattuso. “He’s got a kid’s face, but he has football inside. It’s something I marvel at.”
He wasn’t the only one marvelling.
An academy graduate and a born Catalan, Ricard Puig Martí, ‘Riqui’, was given almost heroic status upon his ascent to the first team. Through him, it seemed written that Barcelona would recover their identity and rule the world again.
But football is cruel.
Two years later, Riqui is nowhere to be seen. Since his emergence three seasons ago, his appearances have dwindled with each successive campaign. Now, he is a footballing outcast.
What happened? Was his quality enhanced by nostalgia? His destiny purely emotional?
Putting aside all biases, I want delve into the nuances of this tale. To unravel the downfall of Riqui Puig, and explain what went wrong once and for all.
This is going to be an in-depth analysis. It isn’t a quick read. If you want to skip any sections, here is your table of contents:
Without further ado, let’s get into this story.
I have to preface this with a disclaimer. In total, at the time of writing, Riqui Puig has played a grand total of 1,539 minutes for the Barcelona first team. That’s the equivalent of just 17.1 games.
As a result, the data behind his performances is limited. The sample size is too small to draw any definitive conclusions. For the majority of this story, we’ll be relying on what we can see on the football pitch.
I will be using some data where appropriate. For example, to point out general trends and measure certain attributes over time. But it will not be a stats-heavy analysis. Nor can it be.
With that in mind, let’s talk about football.
The context behind Riqui’s appearance was of injuries, financial impotence and COVID-19.
Still technically a B team player and only 20 years old, he was called up by Quique Setién to bolster a midfield during the relentless post-covid Liga schedule.
Frenkie de Jong was injured. Arthur Melo’s sale to Juventus was incoming. Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitić were ageing, the latter of which was the only cover to Sergio Busquets.
It was necessity that forced Riqui into the squad. But his footballing prowess kept him there.
Setién used a variety of systems in his short spell; 4–3–3, 4–4–2 and 3–5–2. But each was based on the same, possession-based principles:
It was a team that, despite its talent, often looked clumsy and confined. The cerebral, positional football of Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova had been long forgotten.
Here is a clip that sums up that Barcelona. Unforgivably narrow, with a string of short passes through the centre, ultimately looking for Messi to produce something.
In this environment, Riqui Puig was revolutionary. Why? He took this version of Barcelona, a sort of knock-off ‘tiki taka’, and injected a shot of the real thing.
In a tired, uninspiring Barcelona attack, Riqui was admired for his raw exuberance and quality. He brought a sense of urgency and imagination that was lacking from anyone not called Messi. Like Leo, Riqui had that ability to break the mould; to produce something unexpectedly brilliant.
These qualities were the basis of his wide acclaim. Of course, at that time, nobody was focusing on the nuances of his game. His movement, his decision making, his versatility, or defensive contributions. He was only young after all. Years later, we can look at these things with more objectivity.
With this context in mind, the next section is an in-depth profile of Riqui Puig the footballer. It will be largely based on his performances under Setién, but won’t completely exclude his later cameos under Ronald Koeman and Xavi Hernández.
I’ll try and paint as complete a picture as possible.
Starting with the obvious, Riqui Puig is short (5ft6), slender, and nimble. He’s abnormally quick over a short distance, but this is obviously compensated by his lack of strength and physical presence.
As you’d expect of a La Masia graduate, he is technically proficient with the ball at his feet. Excellent first touch, exceptional close control, and a precise passer across most distances — almost exclusively using his favoured right foot.
Riqui compliments his technical skills with a sharp mind, enabling him to make quick decisions in tight spaces or under pressure. This is one of his biggest strengths, which we will talk about shortly.
These attributes obviously lend themselves well to a creative midfielder in a possession-heavy team.
Under Setién, he played as a left centre midfielder (left interior) in a 4–3–3, or central attacking midfielder in a 4–4–2 diamond. In the current Xavi Hernández regime, he’s made his cameos as a left interior in a 4–3–3; his preferred position.
In terms of role, Riqui is what we might call a ‘connective’ player. Left to his own devices, he likes to receive the ball from the defenders, combine with the other midfielders in the centre of the pitch, and help turn low-threat defensive possession into final-third opportunities. Through precise passing and fluid movement.
This complimented perfectly the way Setién’s Barca operated. A lot of passes, mainly through the centre, to players in close proximity. It put Riqui in his element, and he performed brilliantly. Delivering moments of quality that turned deep possession into threat — like this disguised pass through the middle to Vidal:
Or this first touch flick between his legs, again to Vidal.
With workmen like Rakitić and Busquets behind him, and mercenaries like Messi and Suarez ahead, Riqui was the bridge between order and chaos. And it got the best out of his abilities.
Here is a typical heatmap to demonstrate his zone of operation, as an interior in a 4–3–3. You can see how deep he likes to drop, and how infrequently he goes beyond the 18 yard box. This is Riqui’s comfort zone.
In possession, Riqui showed promise for a few reasons:
Precise passing and movement
Riqui is all about moving the ball — both to keep possession and generate threat. His ability to pass accurately, and in a variety of ways, is paramount. While the data is limited, we can see a clear trend in terms of pass accuracy and chance creation.
You can also see he likes to play short and safe, with a relatively low number of progressive passes.
Part of what makes this possible is his off-the-ball movement. He’s a player that is drawn to the ball a lot. It means he gets a lot of touches, and his team maintain high possession. Later on we’ll see why this is a limitation as well as strength.
Rapid decision making
Riqui has an great close-quarters radar. When he drops deep to receive the ball, he doesn’t just do so for the sake of it. Often, he has a pass in mind before the ball arrives. It’s why he can moves the ball with just one or two touches.
This also leads to some decisive, imaginative progression, like the passes to Vidal we saw earlier. In his very best game for Barca, against Deportivo Alavés, this awareness turned into ruthlessness. In that game alone, he managed 5 shot creating actions and got 2 assists. A sign that he could be decisive, as well as responsible.
Close control and dexterity
To round off his positive traits, Riqui is a difficult player to dispossess. Despite his lithe frame, his control, awareness and acceleration make him particularly ‘press-resistant’.
The clip below gives a great example of that.
On to his weaknesses. And it’s here we get a glimpse of the story to come. Starting with his most regrettable:
Careless off-ball movement
While Riqui has a sharp mind for passes, his awareness is limited when it comes to the bigger pitcher: creating and exploiting space. His tendency to come short for passes is useful, but there are times when it hurts his team.
In the example below, his movement to the ball compresses space, congests the middle of the pitch, and makes it easier for the opponents to squeeze Barca.
Moments later, Nico González visibly waves Riqui away, telling him where to move.
This ties into a second weakness: not recognising where the space is. As a result, Riqui is hesitant to run in-behind the defence. He does it occasionally, but it’s not natural for him. This was a trend I saw in almost every game of his.
Riqui’s awareness of the immediate space around him is good, but his sense for the bigger picture, the fluid mechanics of a high-level football team, is not so.
Lack of versatility
What this amounts to is an inability to play any offensive position other than his own. He couldn’t be a winger, not because he is a poor dribbler, but because he wouldn’t understand the necessary movement and positioning.
Nor could he be an effective false nine, because he would not know when to drop deep, and when to occupy space.
The conclusion is very important: Riqui is excellent in his niche, but lacks versatility outside of it. At least, that’s the current situation. He’s still only 22, lest we forget.
The final pass?
This is difficult to judge, purely because of the sample size. Riqui shows flashes of decisiveness, against Alavés for example. But in many other games he’s shown a reluctance (sometimes a lack of ability) to execute the final pass. It was either too late, as he preferred a safe option, or it didn’t hit the target.
The remedy could simply be confidence, which is developed through game-time.
That’s why I’m also going to refrain from commenting on Riqui’s finishing ability. Perhaps he could become a decent goal-scoring midfielder, perhaps not. One way or the other, he would need the chance to prove it.
Unfortunately, when his team is out of possession, we have to skip over any strengths and move straight to the weaknesses.
I’m going to have to lean heavily on stats for this. I would rather not, but the consistency from game to game suggests that the numbers are reflective of Riqui’s defensive ability.
No matter what metric you look at, Riqui’s weakness is clear. I’m going to jump the gun and compare him to Barca’s current midfield options. Below are Riqui’s defensive actions across all his first team games, vs the current Barcelona midfielders in the 21/22 season.
Here’s the data — underneath I’ll list the key takeaways.
Applying pressure
If Riqui were to excel in any defensive metric, it would be here. In fact, he does make a lot of pressures. But they rarely lead to successful turnovers — only 21%.
Tackling
Not only does Riqui have the lowest number of tackles, but is also the least successful with his attempts. He wins the ball back just 18% of the time, leading to more players dribbling past him than his colleagues.
Interceptions and positioning
Of course, many midfielders make up for a lack of physicality and tackling by being excellent readers of the game. Riqui is not one of them. He intercepts less passes than any other of Barca’s midfielders.
This should give you a good idea of Riqui Puig’s footballing attributes. A player with undeniable quality in possession, but one whose profile narrows the more you look at it.
His defensive weakness is glaring, but perhaps more pertinent is his limited understanding of the wider game.
Both of these things bring us nicely to the modern day, where Xavi Hernández is building a team based on a very relevant principle: positional awareness. If you came here wondering why Riqui doesn’t get game time, these next two sections try to answer that.
Many Barca fans, especially those who had praised Riqui in the Setién days, were certain he would get his chance under Xavi.
In fact, reading Riqui’s profile, it might have occurred how similar Riqui Puig is to Xavi Hernández himself.
But it hasn’t happened for our boy. Why? We can only speculate. Based on what we know about Xavi’s Barcelona, there are a couple of relevant clues:
The fundamental pillar of Xavi’s Barcelona is positional play. It’s a philosophy developed most famously by Johan Cruyff, mastered by his Dream Team of the early 90s, and revived by Pep Guardiola in 2008/09.
In this system, the players aim to position themselves relative to their teammates, in order to circulate the ball effectively and be suitably placed to win it back. It’s all about angles, distances, and supreme awareness of the game around you.
Looking at some of Riqui’s movement off the ball, it’s apparent that his positional awareness isn’t always fantastic. We can only imagine that for Xavi, this is a big deal.
Despite being excellent on a micro-level in possession, it’s possible that Riqui doesn’t have enough understanding on a macro-level to use his qualities effectively.
This becomes more of a problem when we look at the new role of the interiors in Xavi’s Barcelona.
Rather than just controlling tempo in the centre of the pitch, turning defence into attack (which is what Riqui does best), the interiors in Xavi’s system are much more expansive.
In build-up, they play high and wide, often along the same line as the centre forward.
That means they’re tasked with much more than just keeping the ball. Along with the wingers, they’re the chief goal creators from wide positions. They are responsible for:
Xavi’s interiors carry a lot of responsibility, perhaps more than any other position on the pitch. They’ll frequently find themselves out wide, in the box, and orchestrating from deep all in the same game.
This requires a unique trifecta of quality, awareness and versatility. And as we’ve discussed, awareness and versatility are two of Riqui’s biggest offensive weaknesses.
In isolation, Riqui’s reliability in possession and ability to create goal-scoring chances would merit some degree of patience.
He might not have all these other attributes now, but given time and guidance, why not? We have seen enough raw quality to believe he can produce at the highest level. That’s surely worth investing in.
The problem is, he doesn’t have time. In his second year at Barcelona, as he wallowed on the bench under Ronald Koeman, the gates opened for a new crop of young, talented midfielders. Players that have stunted Riqui’s development more than any other factor.
Their names are Pedri, Gavi and Nico González.
If you want a quick and diluted conclusion to this story, you can discard everything I’ve said and walk away with this:
The long-term development of Pedri, Gavi and Nico are more important to Xavi than that of Riqui Puig.
We’ve already seen the defensive handicap Riqui has compared to his colleagues. That alone would be enough for most managers to sideline him. But considering how influential the interiors are in Barca’s goal-scoring— and considering this is a team that usually dominates the ball — their respective offensive abilities becomes much more relevant.
For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to compare each player to Riqui in turn, and give the top reason why I think each has won Xavi’s favour.
At only 19, Pedri is already one of best midfielders in world football. Utterly reliable in and out of possession, a full range of precise passing, a talented dribbler in tight spaces, and capable of match-winning goals. Most importantly, he understands positional play as if it’s second nature. Pedri is always moving. Not just looking for the ball, but creating and exploiting space for himself and others. A preposterous talent.
Advantage over Riqui: Higher quality on and off the ball, with a better understanding of positional play. There is no debate here.
At just 17 years old, Gavi is raw talent. Like Riqui, his close control makes him incredibly difficult to dispossess, regardless of space. But what sets Gavi apart is his tenacity off the ball. Under Xavi, Barca’s defence relies heavily on man-to-man pressure, quick turnovers and even tactical fouls. In all of these aspects, Gavi is far more capable.
Combine that with greater versatility, and a natural tendency to run in-behind, Gavi is imperious despite his youth.
Advantage over Riqui: Provides more cover off-the-ball, and has shown better awareness of Xavi’s system.
Nico, at first glance, appears the least remarkable of the group. While very tidy in possession, he lacks the imagination and unpredictability of Riqui. But he has something very important going for him: his physicality. Having been coached as a pivot in La Masia, not only is he clearly the best defensively, but is arguably the most versatile. Despite his size he’s shown impressive dribbling skills and intelligent off-ball movement.
With Sergio Busquets ageing, the team’s only ball-winning midfielder, Nico perhaps has a future in a more reserved role. If so, developing him now becomes absolutely crucial.
Advantage over Riqui: Better defensively and more versatile, able to play in any midfield position. He may be the future heir to Busquets’ throne.
In each case, there’s a reasonable argument for Xavi to leave Riqui on the bench.
Of course this is Barcelona, so there may be other factors involved. Political or otherwise. I would rather not speculate on those purely because we don’t have all the information. But from a purely footballing point of view, it’s not criminal to prioritise these other young talents ahead of Riqui. Xavi has said it himself:
“He has a lot of competition, fierce competition and I feel bad not giving him more minutes. He trains very well, I’m happy with him, he’s improving but the pity is that there is a lot of competition in midfield with Pedri, Nico, Gavi, Frenkie.”
Which brings us to the end of this piece. With Xavi’s first season nearly over, and a vital transfer window coming up, has Riqui simply run out of time? Or, perhaps, is there one last chance?
In 2018, Sport projected that Riqui would become one of the best players in the world. The latest news is that Barca have decided to sell him.
Riqui himself seems unmoved, recently claiming that he wants to fight for his place. But with so many players ahead of him, and the imminent signing of 7th midfielder Frank Kessié, it doesn’t seem reasonable to bet on the young Catalan.
If Barca want to register more players, they’ll be technically obligated to move others on.
In other words, it looks like the writing is on the wall for Riqui. And that’s a huge shame.
Like Gattuso, like thousands of others, I have always been a fan of Riqui Puig.
He does things every Barcelona fan wants to see. He plays one and two touch. He’s inventive and electric. His football language is pass and move.
But in the circumstances, none of that will be enough.
If Xavi had arrived in 2020, instead of Ronald Koeman, it could have been a different story. Perhaps Riqui would have been coached into the new system while his confidence was high, and without the burden of competition.
Now, as it is, his stagnation has left him too far down the pecking order. Talent only gets you so far at Barcelona, and sadly for Riqui, he’s never had the support or belief behind him to make the most of it. But for a miracle, time looks to be up.
Of course, football being football, you can never make any definitive conclusions. Perhaps, some day, the stars will align and Riqui will prove everyone wrong. Perhaps he’ll avenge his lost career. Like Gerard Piqué, Jordi Alba and Cesc Fábregas. Or perhaps not.
For a player with so few opportunities, the fan base he’s established is remarkable. If nothing else, it shows that patience, passion, and a love for your club go a long way. Whichever way your career turns, I’ll be rooting for you, Riqui.
And I won’t be the only one.
Thanks for reading, if you enjoyed be sure to leave a ‘clap’ and follow the page for more Barcelona content. I’d really appreciate it!

Hello my friends!
I have so many essays and journal entries from my time in Spain that I’m excited to share with you on here.
Sorry that I’ve been a bit MIA during the past few months while I’ve been traveling.
I had hoped I’d publish essays every week or so, but perhaps I needed a bit of time for my ideas to percolate a bit more fully.
I am feeling ready though, to bring you my essays and journals that I’ve been writing throughout my time here.
I’ve had so many experiences I want to share with you.
In the meantime, here are some lovely photos from the other day as I walked along the shore. ☀️🌊🤗
Update me in the comments, how was your summer?
How are you feeling?
What you have you been up to lately?
I miss you all!!
Sending love,
Alex ☀️🌊

“Visit Barcelona”, was once the slogan of the Barcelona Tourism Consortium, but in August last year it was replaced by “This is Barcelona”, after 15 years.
The change marks a new strategy of targeting “higher-value visitors who generate greater social return”. But it is also telling of the times, as mass tourism becomes increasingly unpopular within the city.
In 2024, some of Spain’s most visited cities saw anti-tourist protests, with demonstrations in the Balearic and Canarie islands, as well as Barcelona and Malaga. But these protests also came during a year of record tourism that proved to be vital in helping shape the Spanish economy for 2024.
This raises the question, why have the Spanish people fallen out of love with tourism?
Spain’s economy is thriving. In comparison to the five largest European economies (not including Russia), Spain had the most real growth in GDP in 2024, outpacing Germany, France and Italy — The Economist named Spain as their top economy for 2024.
Tourism contributed 0.76 percentage points to Spain’s 3.2% GDP growth, accounting for nearly a quarter of total economic expansion, according to Caixabank. Furthermore, the sector’s contribution to the GDP of Spain in 2024 reached 13%, and is predicted to continue growing in 2025, marking the significance of the sector on the Spanish economy.
But every silver lining has its cloud. Graffiti across the streets of Barcelona show a different side to the story. One such example (pictured in the beginning of the article) tells tourists to go home — others use far more colourful language.
There are several motivations for the turn away from the tourist industry, despite its positive economic effect. One of the most notable is that of housing.
A quick search on any popular listing app will show several rentals that must be vacated in the summer months so that the properties can be rented to tourists and other visitors who will pay more money for fewer days stay.
Jordi Nicolás Soler, 35, a lifetime Barcelona resident, explained the difficulties in finding a place of his own to live in. After nine years he was able to rent a flat, but it is small, on the ground floor, and has no natural light.
The problem, says Jordi, is exacerbated by short-term rentals and foreign residents who can afford to pay more than locals, pricing them out of the city. “Sometimes Barcelona feels like an amusement park; it’s not for locals anymore.”
Looking at the stats, there has been a steady increase in the price per square meter of renting in the last 5 years within Barcelona, according to Idealista, a property listings site.
In 2022, residents in Catalonia (the region where Barcelona is situated) on average spent 58% of gross income on rent, putting them in joint first place with the Balearic isles and beating out the Community of Madrid (home of the Spanish capital of the same name) by one percentage point.
“You feel like a foreigner in your own country.”
The increase in tourism has also put a strain on local culture and language. Barcelona is the capital of the autonomous region of Catalonia, which has its own distinct culture and language. But as more people have been visiting Barcelona, fewer people are speaking Catalan in their daily lives within the city.
A Catalan government survey conducted every five years found a decline in the use of Catalan as the primary language, alongside a rise in Spanish usage between 2018 and 2023.
“Spanish is probably the most spoken language in Barcelona,” says Jordi. “With English becoming more and more popular.
“As a Catalan speaker, it is very common for us to go anywhere like a supermarket and not be able to speak to the cashiers or the shop assistants in our own language because they already speak Spanish, and they know all of us speak Spanish, so why should I bother learning another language.
“You feel like a foreigner in your own country.”
The Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic (ABDT), an organisation working against the process of “touristification”, stress the need for regulation by the authorities. They state that regulation will be “inevitable” because if not the city will be reduced to “a mere stage set” that is “emptied of its population”.
The Generalitat of Catalonia has vowed to bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028 and has forbidden the issuing of new short-term rental licences in an effort to combat the rising cost of rent. However, such a drastic move has raised concerns regarding an increase in unlicensed rentals.
Even if regulation of rentals does improve the housing market in Barcelona, the AFBD are still concerned with other major issues caused by touristification.
Economic dependencies on a sector that requires stability to survive leaves the city vulnerable to crisis that can hurt the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic is the clearest example of this, as seen in the massive downturn of GDP production from tourism in 2020 and 2021 in Chart 2.
The ABDT also point out the issues with the labour market within the tourism sector. They say that it is one of the most exploitative sectors in the city in terms of working conditions, with hyper-flexibility, undeclared work, and outsourcing of services. Moreover, the average salary in the tourism sector is approximately 60% of that of the national average for all over sectors.
With around 9.1% of the population of Barcelona employed in the tourism sector, these are factors that affect almost one in ten residents.
Pushing for further specialization in tourism is essentially asking the local population to become poorer while others get even richer, says the ABDT.
“Don’t come.”
The ABDT make a point that their message is not directed at individual tourists, as they see little potential for a solution from that angle, instead advocating for a change in production rather than consumption.
However, this does not let tourists off the hook. They make it clear that in the current context, there is no possibility of a respectful form of tourism that benefits the local economy. If they had to say something to tourists, their message would simply be: “Don’t come”.

If you watch Barcelona at this point, you would understand how aptly this gif epitomizes the current situation of the club, as we’re halfway through the season its looking like another one of those trophyless outings for the Catalan side. After already being out of the Spanish Super Cup & the Copa Del Rey technically they still have 2 major trophies to fight for including La Liga and the Champions League (yeah good luck with that!) but most fans have lost hope with this season. And now with Xavi leaving the club in the summer things are not looking good this season.
Let’s take a closer look at the underlying issues plaguing this club and how might Barca actually turn this around if they can that is.
Xavi as a player has been a core part of the Spanish national team and the mighty treble winning Barcelona squad which purely dictates his instinct as a manager and how he means to preserve the Barca DNA.
Since his arrival, Xavi has been using his 3–2–2–3 formation in possession or a 2–3–5 shape to great effect as seen below, this shape offers a lot of advantages in build up from the back and chance creation upfront.
This formation consists of a lone striker upfront as Lewandowski, two inside forwards preferably Pedri/Gavi & Gundogan, two wingers/wide players to hug the touchline preferably Balde & Lamine/Raphinha, two pivots preferably Frenkie & Cancelo/Romeu and 3 centrebacks preferably Christensen, Araujo & Kounde.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Xavi’s approach as he has used the same structure to win the league last season by scoring a lot of goals but also maintaining a solid rest defence at the back. Xavi wants his players to equally spread around the pitch and occupy each zone so that every player has passing options around them and can combine easily to escape pressure. Having 5 players in the front line enables them to frequently pull opposition players from the backline to create space with smart off-the ball movements.
With highly technical players deeper such as Frenkie, Gundogan they create loads of chances every game with balls over the top, line breaking passes, swerving crosses. Having Pedri, Gundogan & Gavi between the lines is important as they can easily receive the ball under pressure and turn in tight spaces to play the final pass. With young players such as Balde & Lamine Yamal in wide areas you get runners in-behind as well as players willing to take on fullbacks everytime. And with 3 solid centre-backs in defence they should (in theory) be able to defend well right?
But that is not the case this season, now let’s take a look at some of the issues holding this team back
After getting rid of Fati, Dembele, Eric Garcia and Ez Abde in the summer window Barcelona were mainly looking to add to their squad depth upfront. But with Barca’s never ending financial struggles, it meant that they can only look for less costly replacements, as a result Oriol Romeu and Inigo Martinez were signed to improve their squad depth at the back.
After showing interest in both João Félix and João Cancelo, Xavi was able to get both on loan, all thanks to them falling out with their respective clubs. Where Félix was looking for a fresh start while Cancelo was purely looking for regular playtime under Xavi. With this Barca capped of a decent summer window as compared to their Spanish rivals who went gung ho to improve their squad as well.
After a bothersome start to the season which saw Pedri & Frenkie getting injured and missing some important games in the first half of the season, Barca mostly relied on its youngsters with Lamine Yamal, Gavi and even Fermin getting some minutes every now and then.
Midway through the season they were hit hard by 2 more major injuries on regular first team players: Gavi and Ter Stegen which would see both of them missing the whole 23/24 season. Both of them were integral to Blaugrana’s success and the way they played last year which makes them difficult to replace.
A simple search query tells us that Barcelona have recorded the most xG in all of Europe’s top 5 leagues seconded only by Bayern Munich. But their lack of finishing up top has been a major concern as they have failed to hit the mark time and again. Though xG can be deceiving sometimes when teams attempt a lot of shots at goal, but if we look at npxG per shot Barca still ranks the highest in the league along with Girona.
While most top teams have exceeded their xG by scoring more with a fair margin Barcelona have struggled to put the ball in the back of the net, in fact among the top 15 teams in Europe they have the worst (Goals-xG) stat along with Chelsea (which is obviously not great company at the moment!).
Robert Lewandowski who has been a stellar striker throughout his career has been struggling to even make an impact this season, he’s been pretty subpar when it comes to linking up, making incisive runs and even controlling the ball in the penalty area.
Part of this decline is understandable as he is not in his prime any more and is probably enjoying what might be his last few years of playing at the top level. But, with lack of clear striking options for Barcelona where they loaned out Fati in the summer window, and Ferran & Felix both reluctant to fill the #9 position it has become quite tricky and definitely raises questions on the squad depth.
Though Vitor Roque who was signed in the winter as a long-term prospect might be able to challenge Lewandowski and provide cover for him at this moment.
Generally when we think of Barcelona we think of fast free flowing football, a team boasting of highly technical players all over the pitch playing proper Cruyff football. We rarely see Barcelona being associated with the word “defensive solidity”, but that is what happened last season when Barcelona displayed the best defensive record not just in the league but all over Europe!
A big part of this performance was Barcelona’s newly formed Back 4 which consisted of new summer signings Kounde & Christensen along with Araujo and a young academy prospect Alejandro Balde. This back 4 was Xavi’s preferred combination when fit which conceded just 20 goals in 38 league games and 46 goals in 55 matches across all competitions!
But this season, fans have seen a mere hint of past glory achieved by this combination as they’ve failed to keep clean sheets time and again and keep conceding goals to every opposition they play. Defensive errors at the back have become quite common and their defensive structure seems deformed most of the time. But, who is to blame?
Marc Andre Ter-Stegen who has been a loyal servant for the Blaugrana for almost a decade now, a club where he established himself as a world-class keeper and is undoubtedly the best ball-playing goalie in Europe right now is definitely being missed by everyone. He is a core part of the Barcelona defense as he vastly overperformed his expectations last season by keeping the most clean sheets in the league.
But Barca aren’t just missing his spider-like reflexes on the goal line, they are also missing his great passing range and ball playing prowess from the back. His ability to take charge against high pressing sides and playing a pinpoint ball to a free man upfront has been his career highlight and part of what makes him world-class.
Iñaki Peña who is currently filling for him in his absence has been subpar at best with a poor save percentage, he also clearly lacks the skillset Ter-Stegen has and still needs time to develop as a proper first team goalkeeper.
Conceding early goals almost every time has been the story so far this season as Barca conceded first in 7 out of 19 games before the winter break, with most of these goals coming just within 10 minutes post kickoff. As a result of the game state, Barca are bound to chase games every now and then which causes a lot of impatience among the players as they look to create chances as soon as possible.
Though this in theory should work in their favor but it has instead worked against them as an impatient pass during build up leaves them outnumbered at the back leading to a turnover at times when the defense isn’t expecting. This coupled with the fact that Barca have no natural ball-winners in midfield meaning their counterpressing has been pretty wasteful this season.
Of all injuries that have plagued this team, Barca were hit the hardest by Gavi’s absence, yes a 19-year old midfielder from La Masia is literally the heart and soul of this Barcelona team. His pressing intensity and passion for winning the ball back is unmatched not just in Barca but all over Europe.
The Golden Boy winner is already a regular starter for club & country and has been hailed by Xavi as irreplaceable in his side, despite his short stature he is brimming with confidence and always gives his best in every duel despite the odds. With Barcelona boasting of a highly technical midfield in Frenkie and Gundogan, Gavi provides the bite it needs to dominate every game.
After Busquets’ departure, who was arguably the greatest holding midfielder of his generation and someone who perfectly fit the job description and the style of play at Barcelona, Barca have struggled to match his numbers whether it maybe in defensive actions or the ball-playing abilities he had. Gavi definitely does not match his profile but has stepped up his game alongside Busquets and after his departure in the defensive shift he puts in each game. His ability to man-mark Bellingham and nullify his presence for 70 minutes in the El-Clasico is what amazed me the most this season.
Gavi’s still leading the charts in the number of tackles put in by Barca players despite being out for a major part of the season as shown below. In fact, he’s the #1 ball winner for the team in the attacking 3rd phase of the game and significantly reduces the number of turnovers Barca face.
Gavi is a player I personally adore a lot and he is someone whose mere presence would fix a lot of issues with this team right now. My personal favorite memory of him will always be winning an aerial duel against Wout Weghorst in the Champions League who with all due respect towers over him 😅.
The left-back role provides a tricky problem for the Catalan side in recent times which was sought to be over until the start of this season but instead grows even deeper. A 19-year old academy prospect Alejandro Balde in his breakout season showed the world why he deserves to be on the first-team sheet ahead of veteran full-back Jordi Alba. Balde exceeded everyone’s expectations and completely obliterated his critics with his stellar performances, despite that he has struggled this season and has definitely failed to make the same impact this year. But is it even Balde’s fault?
As discussed earlier Xavi wants to stretch the opposition backline by playing 5 forwards when in possession and in this system Balde is the one who provides width on the left hand side of the pitch. This totally suits Balde’s traits as he is a naturally offensive fullback who can easily slip past defenders relying solely on his pace.
Which brings me to my main point: Balde is an offensive fullback and NOT a WINGER! Look at these stats below comparing wide players from this and last season. Comparing his stats to a proper winger we can see that he attempts less take-ons than actual wingers and instead likes to go around the opposition backline.
While Balde definitely found success by taking on players last season he has been a shadow of his former self this season and part of the reason is that his game is not about taking on fullbacks or dribbling his way through the opposition backline with the ball. Instead it is more about the off the ball movements and the burst of pace he provides to attack space to play dangerous passes/crosses in the penalty area, which brings me to my final point.
Well “A picture is worth a thousand words” and if there is any truth to that adage here it is. Look at this image below, this picture clearly explains some issues with this squad that often go unnoticed.
This snapshot is from Barca playing against Real Betis which was also Balde’s last game after he was sidelined for the whole season. As we talked about Xavi’s structure before how he wants his players to occupy all zones when in possession so that every player has an outlet to play the ball to, in this case the left-half space is completely empty meaning that Balde has no one to combine with and has to play 1v2 against the two Betis players. This sequence results in Balde trying to take-on the fullback and playing an uncharacteristic cross which finds no one and possession is lost.
This issue is not limited to a particular sequence in this match, it has become a common theme among all matches this season which hinders Balde’s ability. The major issue here is player profiling, since the front five in possession consists of Lewandowski and Ferran playing together, both of whom like to drift into central areas and hence create this gap. Last season, this was not a problem as the front five usually consisted of Gavi and Pedri playing as the interiors so the wide players always found it easy to combine with them under pressure. But with Gavi, out of the picture Balde has been totally isolated on the left flank and can barely prove useful.
Barcelona have been blessed to have a Lamine Yamal among their ranks as the youngster has been beyond outstanding in his breakthrough season. In fact, Barca have been heavily reliant on this young prodigy this whole season who has lit up the league and is taking on every player left, right and center.
For me personally, Lamine has been the best forward in this team by a long shot and reminds me why I love watching this team. Despite being a 16-year old he is overflowing with confidence and is ready to take on defenders at will, escape from pressure and mature enough to release the ball at the right time. What amazes me is that he still has a lot of time to develop and with regular playing time in the coming seasons I’m thrilled to see what the future holds for him.
Gündoğan has been nothing short of world-class since the start of this season and has easily become the most consistent player in the squad. While all the other midfielders have been ridiculed with some form of injury in different phases of the season Gündoğan has been Xavi’s go-to-man in the middle of the park.
Due to his technical brilliance and reliability he has played more minutes than other player in the squad and has contributed in single phase of play. Though his preferred position is as an interior upfront, he has also played as a pivot covering for Frenkie in his absence making him extremely flexible. With the season coming to an end Barca could definitely use his clutch potential and big game mentality to save this season.
Though most of these issues and problems discussed above just seem to be small tactical tweaks & psychological issues with the players and their dropping intensity this season, which is not as bad as it looks. Since, Barca don’t necessarily need new personnel they just need to reinvigorate themselves and a couple of good results might just do that.
I hope this blog was worth your time if you made till the end, this took a lot of time & effort and was also my first attempt at bringing my Football knowledge & Data Analysis skills to the table.
Thank you for reading and have a good day! 😅

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

I always thought I’d visit Barcelona for the first time during the summer or spring. After all, it’s a city known for its blazing Spanish sun and beaches. The idea to visit for December festivities came about when my boyfriend and I decided to go away somewhere close to Christmas this year, as we wouldn’t be spending the holiday together. Barcelona came up as an affordable option and after researching what the city looked like in winter, we were sold.
It’s safe to say it turned out to be the perfect Christmas break and one I’d recommend to anyone. So here is what I got up to over 2 nights in the Catalan city and what I’d recommend for any future travellers.
The first stop after dropping the suitcase off at our hotel was to go for a late brunch at the vegetarian restaurant Faire Brunch and Drinks. Barcelona is a very vegetarian and vegan-friendly city, and it was not at all difficult to find delicious plant-based food. Brunch also seemed to be a very popular meal in the city. People in Spain seem to eat meals later than in the UK. To that end, one great thing about Barcelona, and I believe Spain in general, is how late many places are open. Many of the cafes we visited didn’t shut until 10 at night or even later and…

As usual, I kept being awake until on board and slept during the flight. This is the first time I have visited Spain. I could pass the immigration smoothly and head to the city centre by bus. Barcelona is warmer than London, so a half-sleeve T-shirt made me comfortable. After a 40-50-minute bus journey, I headed to the hostel on foot. Leaving my backpack, I went out for lunch.
ChatGPT recommended a restaurant close to the Sagrada Família. Although a paella was served for two as a minimum, when I asked, they would serve for one. So I could order one. I also had a bottle of beer that seemed to be local beer.
Following lunch, I went to the Sagrada Família directly. It was larger and had more colourful decorations than expected, so I felt it was more adorable than majestic. Whilst I wanted to enter, the admission ticket had sold out a long time ago. Therefore, I only watched its exterior.
I strolled through the city to visit other buildings by Gaudí, Casa Batlló and Casa Milà. I nibbled into a Starbucks store near Casa Batlló and bought a seasonal cold beverage with melon flavour. Though Starbucks UK also provides this drink, I didn’t know that. It was not too sweet, so I loved it.
Since I had nothing to do after watching Gaudí’s architecture, I tried to ask ChatGPT. However, due to fatigue, I slumbered on a bench. Even though the duration was shorter than that in Dublin, I thought this hot weather was causing me exhaustion. Upon waking up, I ventured through the city and popped into a gelato shop that caught my eye. I chose a lemon, one of my five favourite flavours, and a tiramisu. These were a little expensive, but I believe that they were worth their price. Especially, the lemon gelato was scrumptious.
When I finished the ice cream, it was evening. As is obvious from my nap, I was exhausted so much. So I decided to have supper earlier for tomorrow. I ordered four tapas and a glass of Clara, lemon beer, at a bar recommended by ChatGPT. All of the tapas were excellent, but I especially liked the Spanish omelettes with a good soup stock.
Leaving the bar, I detoured to a supermarket to buy a bottle of water. Browsing drink counters, a drink captivated my eye. It was AQUARIUS, a hydration drink, also sold in my country. However, I’d never seen it in other countries, including the UK, so I promptly grabbed it. The taste seems almost the same as the beverage sold in Japan. Nonetheless, I don’t remember the taste of the Japanese one in detail because I have never drunk it in over two years. Or maybe the Spanish one was a bit lighter in flavour than the Japanese one.

As a lifelong FC Barcelona fan and aspiring data scientist, I set out to blend my passion for football with analytics in a final project focused on the 2021/22 La Liga season. Motivated by countless hours watching matches at the Camp Nou and a desire to quantify what we saw on the pitch, our goal was to make sense of Barça’s famed passing game, not just through basic stats, but by capturing the spatial context of each play.
We wanted to understand how FC Barcelona occupies and uses space during possessions, and how that might differ from other teams. In this article, we walk through the journey and findings of our project, introducing the concept of dynamic space tagging, the data and methods behind it, the spatial patterns we uncovered in Barcelona’s play (both home and away), and the interactive dashboard we built to explore it all.
Modern football analytics often emphasize the importance of creating and exploiting space — but how can we systematically label where players are in relation to their own team’s shape and that of the opponent? In our project, we tackled this challenge by introducing dynamic space tags: a method to categorize player positions in real time based on team formations. Using convex hulls and simple spatial rules, we drew a hull around all players of a team at any given moment , to represent the team’s shape on the field. Each player was then assigned a dynamic label depending on their position relative to this shape and the goals. The tags we used were intuitive football terms: Inside, Outside, Forward, Back, and a special one for the Goalkeeper. Here’s how it works:
Dynamic tagging captures a player’s spatial role at any moment — for example, a fullback might shift from “Back” to “Outside” to “Forward” as play advances. We apply this to both teams, each with their own hull, so players are labeled relative to their team’s shape. Terms like “Forward” or “Inside” always reflect that team’s formation at that moment.
A schematic showing convex hulls for both teams and example dynamic tags (Inside, Outside, Forward, Back) for players based on their position relative to the hull.
By tagging every player position this way, we capture the spatial context of each pass: who passed the ball from what zone to which zone. For instance, a pass from a player labeled “Inside” to a teammate labeled “Forward” might indicate a ball played from midfield into an advanced attacker between the lines. On the other hand, an “Outside” to “Forward” pass could be a classic wing-to-striker cross or diagonal.
To study these patterns, we needed detailed data from matches. We obtained a specialized dataset that merged event data with tracking data for 25 of FC Barcelona’s matches in La Liga 2021/22. Having both event and tracking data combined was crucial: the event data tells us when and what happened (e.g., a pass, a shot), and the tracking data tells us where everyone was when it happened.
What matches were included? The dataset spans 25 league matches.
Each event (like a pass) comes with a lot of information:
However, analyzing individual events in isolation isn’t enough — football is about sequences of plays. So we needed to group events into possessions.
A key step was identifying distinct possessions and aggregating features over each possession. We define a possession as a sequence of consecutive passes by one team without the opponent intervening. A possession continues until the team loses the ball or the play is otherwise interrupted (out of play, foul, shot, etc.).
We sorted all events chronologically and then walked through them to break the timeline into possessions. Whenever we saw a change in the team with the ball (for example, a tackle or interception where Team A’s event is followed by Team B’s event) or when a certain event indicates a natural break (like a shot that isn’t immediately rebounded, or the end of a half), we marked the end of one possession and the start of another.
The possession outcome, since a possession ending in a goal is very different from one ending in a simple lost ball. This was done by looking at the next event and its subtype — for example, if Team A’s play is followed by Team B taking a kickoff, clearly Team A’s possession ended in a Goal. If Team A took a shot and then the next event is a corner kick for Team A, we know the shot was saved out for a Corner. We created a small catalog of such rules to tag possession outcomes (Goal, Shot on Target Saved, Shot Off Target, Corner conceded, Throw-in, Foul, Half-time, etc.) based on the sequence of events.
By engineering these features, we transformed raw tracking and event data into a possession-based dataset. Each possession (whether it’s Barcelona or their opponent) became a data point with dozens of attributes capturing the nature of that possession.
Handling missing data: We encountered a few minor data issues, such as a handful of passes with missing destination coordinates. These were very few (only five missing entries in thousands of events), and we addressed them by either imputing plausible values or excluding those events, ensuring they didn’t skew any possession metrics. Overall, the dataset was clean and complete enough for robust analysis after this preprocessing.
To clarify how we segmented events into possessions, here’s a simplified pseudocode snippet illustrating the logic:
To uncover patterns in our high-dimensional possession data, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering. Instead of analyzing dozens of stats manually, PCA helped us compress the data by identifying key feature combinations that explained the most variance.
We standardized all features to avoid dominance by larger-scale ones (e.g., number of passes vs. width in meters). PCA then gave us a compact view of each possession, preserving key differences. A biplot revealed that features like pass count, vertical distance, and players involved were influential — hinting at distinct possession styles.
Using the elbow method, we chose a few principal components that explained most variance without extra noise. This also let us visualize the data in 2D or 3D for better analysis and effective clustering.
Clustering (K-Means): We applied K-Means to the PCA-transformed data to group similar possessions, aiming to uncover tactical patterns. After testing different values of k and using silhouette scores for validation, we settled on four interpretable clusters, each representing a distinct possession style.
These clusters weren’t predefined — they emerged from the data. Once identified, we could label each possession and analyze how different teams or matches mapped onto each style.
We wanted to know how FC Barcelona’s possession style compared to other teams. Since each match includes both sides, we had data for Barcelona and their 19 La Liga opponents. By aggregating possession stats, we could profile each team based on how they played against Barça.
Clustering revealed clear differences. About 80% of non-Barça possessions fell into the direct play cluster (Cluster 0), while Barcelona had a lower share (~65%) and more in the elaborate clusters. Notably, 19% of Barça’s possessions were in the wide, multi-player style (Cluster 2), compared to 11% for others. They also had more slow build-up possessions (Cluster 1): 5.6% vs 1.1%.
These patterns matched raw averages — Barcelona had more passes and player involvement per possession, consistent with their possession-focused approach under Xavi and Koeman. The data confirmed that their style stood out through metrics like pass count and number of players involved.
To visualize team differences, we built a hierarchical clustering dendrogram using each team’s possession style. The result was clear: FC Barcelona stood out, joining other teams’ branches only at a high distance — marking it as a strong outlier. Along with Barça, Real Madrid, Celta Vigo, and Villarreal also appeared as distinct in style.
These four teams, especially Barça, Celta, and Villarreal, are known for possession-heavy or unique approaches, so the clustering made sense. Most other teams grouped into a few large clusters, showing similar, often direct styles. Teams like Betis, Valencia, Espanyol, and Real Sociedad clustered closely, with little distinction in how they played against Barcelona.
A 2D PCA plot confirmed this: Barcelona sat far from the main team cluster, reinforcing their unique possession game. While Real Madrid, Villarreal, and Celta were also slightly apart, none matched Barça’s distinct style — even in a season below their usual standards.
A dendrogram showing clusters of La Liga teams based on possession style features. Barcelona (and a few others like Real Madrid, Celta, Villarreal) appear on separate branches far from the main group of teams, indicating their distinct styles.
We also explored how Barcelona’s style differed between home and away games. Teams often adjust based on venue, and even Barça isn’t immune. By plotting each match in feature space and color-coding by location (blue for home, red for away), we saw a clear pattern: home games were more spread out, while away matches clustered tightly. This meant Barça showed more stylistic variety at Camp Nou, but played more conservatively and consistently on the road.
At home, they played wider and more expansive football, with more passes between central and wide zones (like “Forward” to “Outside”). Home games also had slightly more passes per possession, pointing to greater dominance. Away matches featured fewer wide switches and more central or backward play — suggesting a tighter, more controlled approach.
The scatter plot confirmed this: red points (away) were tightly grouped, while blue points (home) varied more. A few matches stood out — like a direct, less typical home game vs Alavés, or a highly defensive or reactive away El Clásico vs Real Madrid — showing that game context still plays a role.
In short, Barça was more dynamic and varied at home, while away they stuck to a more consistent and compact game plan.
A scatter plot of Barcelona match possession patterns on principal component axes, with blue points for home games and red points for away games. Blue points are more widely scattered, while red points cluster together, illustrating the greater variability in home style vs the consistency in away matches.
To make our analysis useful — and interactive — we built a dashboard using Streamlit and Altair. It lets users explore passing patterns and dynamic space tags across any subset of possessions. The goal was to move beyond static analysis and let users ask targeted questions like, “How did Barça move the ball in 10+ pass sequences?” or “What did goal-scoring possessions look like?”
We had a few key design goals: intuitive visuals of space labels (even for non-technical users), flexible filters to define specific game scenarios, helpful stats, the ability to step through full possessions pass by pass, and clear team structure visuals.
The dashboard has two main modes:
This split allows different use cases — like isolating a key turnover or studying buildup to a shot.
For visuals, each pass or possession is shown on a pitch graphic with player positions, colored by team. Convex hulls outline team shapes, and arrows highlight passes. We kept the design clean — subtle field lines and unfilled hulls — to keep focus on player positioning and ball movement. This helps analysts quickly spot things like line-breaking passes or overly stretched formations.
Filters and user input:The dashboard’s main strength is its flexible filters, allowing users to drill down into specific scenarios. The sidebar includes:
These filters let analysts form detailed queries. For instance: show Barça possessions ending in a goal, with 10+ passes, and highlight “Inside to Forward” passes in those moves. This could identify key patterns or moments worth reviewing on video.
Interactive use cases:Imagine a coach wants to study how Barcelona plays out from the back under pressure. They can select “Barcelona” as the team, filter for passes after a recovery, and set the origin tag to “Back” (including the goalkeeper). This surfaces possessions where Barça regains the ball and starts from deep positions. The coach can then see whether the first pass typically goes to an “Outside” fullback or an “Inside” midfielder, and view the opponents’ positions to assess pressing structures — quickly identifying patterns before turning to video.
Another example: an analyst compares how teams handle Barcelona’s press. By selecting each opponent’s possessions against Barça and filtering for short possessions ending in a turnover (e.g., ≤3 passes), they can see whether teams like Granada lost the ball quickly (mostly Cluster 0), while others like Real Madrid managed more complex build-ups (more Cluster 2).
Technical details:We built the visualizations using Altair on top of a static football pitch. Convex hulls are drawn from player coordinates using standard geometry libraries. To keep the dashboard fast, we encourage filtering and limit default data loads. Navigation through possessions was initially done via a manual pass index, but future versions may include “Next” and “Previous” buttons or even animations for better usability.
The final product is a hands-on tool for deep exploration. It complements static analysis by helping coaches and analysts test ideas, validate patterns, and surface tactical insights in an interactive way.
Conclusion and reflections:This project gave us a deeper understanding of how data intersects with football tactics. Personally, it was rewarding to see coaching ideas like “maintaining width” or “playing between the lines” reflected in actual data. We confirmed that Barcelona’s possession style isn’t just something you see — it’s measurable: more passes, more player involvement, and distinct spatial patterns. We also saw how context — home vs. away, opponent quality — affects even a team with a strong identity like Barça.
Key takeaways:Dynamic space tagging added a tactical layer to traditional event data by labeling player positions in real time as Inside, Outside, Forward, or Back. This revealed patterns like Barça’s frequent “forward ↔ outside” passes at home or how opponents often stayed in “back ↔ back” loops when pressed. These findings are practical for scouting or game preparation.
Our Streamlit dashboard proved useful for visual analysis, but there’s room to grow. We lacked consistent feedback from coaches and analysts during development. Better UX — like step-through buttons or animated replays — would improve usability. Expanding the dataset beyond one team and partial season would help test the model’s generalizability. Comparing different tactical systems (e.g., low-block teams) could also validate or refine the tagging system.
Ideas for future work:
Final thoughts:Dynamic space models bring tactical depth to data analysis. By combining positioning with events, we can move beyond surface-level stats and quantify the subtleties of play. This project showed that Barça’s style isn’t just iconic — it’s distinct in the data. We hope this work sparks more interest in adding spatial context to football analytics — because football is ultimately about managing space and time, and now we have better tools to track it.

Unfortunately, Airbnb has decided to close its office in Barcelona after 8 years of cooperation with CPM, and now I’m jobless together with 1000 colleagues of mine.
Since 2012 Airbnb has relied on CPM in Barcelona to help hosts and travellers around the world. In 2016 Airbnb acquired the Barcelona start-up Trip4real from Gloria Molins (now Head of Business Incubations Experiences) and created Airbnb Experiences — one-of-a-kind activities designed and hosted by locals.
In March 2019 I joined the big international community of expats at CPM supporting Airbnb users in English, Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese and other languages. In January 2020 I became a member of a cool airbnbexperiences team, then we moved to a new big office, in March 2020 we started working from home… Just couple of days ago we were actively working and reading news that 100 of our colleagues in Ireland have already lost their jobs, and we had a hope that we will still be afloat. All of a sudden, it happened to us also and now almost 1000 people will be unemployed. ⠀
Travel industry was hit hard, and even a giant like Airbnb could not stand it. This is understandable, because now the company has only expenses as everyone cancels their reservations (even for 2021), and income will appear only when we all begin to travel again.
We are not yet fired, but Airbnb has cut all access to their internal tools for us, so we have no work to do. This was communicated to us by our management from CPM without any prior notice (and CPM knew about this decision 20 days before announcing it to us), and we even couldn’t finish our last cases. It felt quite disrespectful how it was done, even with a nice words and empathy.
Airbnb is passionate about its values “Community first” and we were well taught how to promote it to all Airbnb users. Just now we are out of this community like never were inside it…
Also this March Airbnb launched its Service Promise what we needed to spread to each member of Airbnb community:
Then Airbnb has created different support programs to support community during tough times:
But Airbnb hasn’t even said a proper goodbye to its largest international office in Barcelona leaving 1000 people without work.
News about Airbnb closing and letting jobless almost 1000 people were immediately picked up by the main Spanish media El Pais and El Periodico.
The breakup with Airbnb wasn’t on a very positive note, lots of people are not happy how it has ended. Nevertheless, I want to say that thanks to my more than 1-year experience here I’ve got valuable insights about cross-cultural communications, improved my soft skills, learned cool examples of Airbnb marketing campaigns and helped travelers and hosts around the world to solve all kinds of situations they have had.
Especially I will miss our international atmosphere with constant discussions of funny and strange cases, our cooking classes, theme parties and all my teams with great people😔
I believe that the main thing about losing a job is not a dead end, but it’s a start of a new future. Despite all current difficulties we will sort it out as we have no choice. I think we have learned how to solve various life situations with Airbnb users, so it’s time to focus on our own. Good luck to everyone!

Known for its stunning architecture, vibrant culture, and pristine beaches, Barcelona is quickly cementing itself as a booming gravity center for tech and innovation.
The emergence of unicorns such as Glovo (acquired by Delivery Hero), TravelPerk, Belvo and eDreams has spurred the development of the city’s startup ecosystem. This, together with a favorable business climate has bolstered the accessibility of venture capital. According to a new report by Dealroom, Spanish startups now exceed €100 billion in total valuation.
Several experts agree. The Boston Consulting Group has ranked Barcelona as the fifth most attractive city in the world for digital professionals. It also ranks sixth on EU-Startups’ list of the largest European startup hubs. The excitement around the city’s potential is such that Jordi Ribas, corporate VP of Search & AI at Microsoft, said it “has all the necessary elements to become the ‘Silicon Valley of Europe’ in the next 10 years.
In this article, I will assess Barcelona’s potential to live up to this promise, by examining its achievements and prospects in the technology industry.
First of all, Barcelona is strategically positioned as a gateway between Europe and other countries. Thanks to its international airport, as well as the seaport, there is no problem to go to any part of the world and back.
Also, the city’s development strategy has created spaces that facilitate collaboration and creativity. For example, the area of Poblenou was transformed into an urban innovation and technology center — 22@ Barcelona Innovation District. Spaces like these tend to be a magnet for founders, and add a layer of appeal to an already enticing place.
Priscilla Lavoie, a marketing expert based in Barcelona, expands on this. “I think the general attractiveness of Barcelona — the culture, great weather, and central location within Europe — makes it easier for companies in the city to attract tech talent from across the globe. People are willing to move here, which makes the talent pool much larger,” she states.
No innovation ecosystem can flourish without access to capital. Hence, part of Barcelona’s recent prowess is linked to the growth of available funding. According to the Barcelona and Catalonia Startup Ecosystem Report, Catalan startups raised over €5 billion between 2019–2023, 231% more capital than in the previous five-year period. Another report, Mobile World Capital’s Startup Ecosystem Overview, states that Barcelona startups have secured 66.4% of all investments in Spain. It is also worth remarking that according to Dealroom, sectors like climate tech and biotechnology, which hold some of the most promising ventures right now, are snatching most of the capital available for Spanish startups.
This has resulted in a thriving ecosystem. For example, the same Catalonia Startup Ecosystem Report mentions that Barcelona ranks fifth in terms of tech scaleups, with 283. This means companies that have survived the startup stage and have demonstrated their viability. At the same time, projects like the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which now boasts over 150 research projects, create a cluster effect and foster collaboration between academia, Big Tech — Intel, Cisco and IBM, to name a few, are partners of the center — and innovators.
As sizable amounts of funding now gravitate towards deep tech, Barcelona could even have more to win. “Key developments like the recent addition of international submarine cables and the expansion of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center are making the city a prime location for startups in the quantum, AI, and health sectors,” said Nicolás Ventura, Head of Operations at Club GLOBALS, a growth network for tech leaders.
No ecosystem is complete without government support, as founders tend to relocate to entrepreneur-friendly hubs where they can focus on growing their businesses. To increase the region’s allure and attract talented innovators, the Government of Catalonia established ACCIÓ, the agency of business competitiveness. Through its Startup Capital program, ACCIÓ is granting €45,000 to promising tech-based startups. At the same time, the organization is lobbying for policies that make it easier to set up a company in the region.
In 2023, the federal government introduced a nationwide initiative dubbed the Spain Startup Law, which encompassed reducing the corporate tax rate from 25% to 15% for a maximum of 4 years — as long as the company was still considered a startup — and implementing a digital nomad visa to make it easier for international founders to settle. Other measures, such as a 10-year tax exemption on up to €50,000 on stock-based compensation per year, are intended to make it easier to secure talent.
However, there are caveats. To qualify for some of these exemptions, companies needed to be certified by Enisa, a new government agency. Sifted reported that by the end of 2023, only 600 startups were certified out of an expected total of 10,000. Despite these challenges, though, the move seems to have worked with investors. Even if overall VC funding was meager in the last couple of years, Spain seems to have developed more resilience to the global slump.
In Europe, cities like Berlin, London, and Madrid are vying with Barcelona to attract and retain top talent. Compared to some of these European hubs, Barcelona has several competitive advantages. The cost of living is lower than in London or other places like Stockholm, and the lenient weather and more social lifestyle could also have a say.
This, by itself, is not enough though. For companies to have access to a stable stream of talent, a city needs to have thriving universities and research institutions. This is definitely the case for barcelona. Institutions such as GBSB Global and business schools like ESADE, EADA, and IESE, which are listed in the top ranks in Europe, can provide plenty of talent, mentorship, entrepreneurs, and even interns to Barcelona’s start-up scene.
Incubators and accelerators play a key role in boosting a city’s tech scene. Barcelona abounds with them. One of them is Startup Grind, a global community that, through its chapter in the city, has helped connect innovators through gatherings, keynote speeches, and fireside chats. Norrsken, a Swedish impact tech powerhouse, has also set up shop in the city and opened a startup house, as well as Tech Barcelona, a private non-profit that has played a pivotal role in integrating technology into the city.
There are also many top-notch events, something that Nicolás Ventura alludes to. “The city is home to some of the biggest tech conferences in the world, like MWC/4YFN, which gathers over 100,000 tech leaders annually, and the Smart City Expo, which draws global attention and fosters international collaboration on critical issues,” he says. If some factors are paramount to attracting talented individuals, this might be one of the keys to getting them to stay.
Spain’s economic fluctuations can affect investment in innovation. If the overall country’s economy experiences a downturn, funding for startups and research projects might be reduced, causing the founders of these ventures to flock elsewhere.
Bureaucracy can be another problem. As I mentioned, there have been hiccups in the full implementation of Spain’s Startup Law. Canada had a similar problem and presents a cautionary tale. Even though the Startup Visa program looked good on paper, its long wait times diminished its appeal, until many companies chose to establish elsewhere.
Also, there needs to be a careful balance. While growth is good, something that happened in Silicon Valley, for example, is that the excess of capital benefited people who worked for a few companies, but resulted in a prohibitive cost of living for the rest. This led fledgling entrepreneurs to look for other places to start their businesses.
If Barcelona falls behind in some of the aspects presented above, other cities might capitalize on that. There is an intensified competition not only across Europe, but around the world. And despite Spain’s attractiveness, it is still, according to Dealroom, a mid-tier player.
To make a point of comparison, French startups reached a total valuation of €100 billion six years ago, and German startups nine years ago. Does this mean that Spain is lagging that much? Not necessarily, since growth can be exponential. However, it signals something more important. Ambitious startup founders do not hesitate to leave a place where they don’t feel supported.
Compared to professionally-oriented cultures like the United States, Spain is much more relaxed and focused on work-life balance. Also, business tends to center more around relationships.
This is evident in the Hofstede dimension scores. Spain scores low on motivation compared to the US, and high on indulgence. While overall this is not necessarily bad, it is important to strike a balance. Too much pleasure and too little work could cause Barcelona’s startup dreams to flounder.
Does this mean that talented individuals with a big vision will leave? Lena Shagieva, founder of PreggApp, an AI-powered pregnancy tracker, has an interesting perspective. “There is a reason why there is only one Silicon Valley. After experiencing living there and living here (Barcelona) now, I can tell, these places are built for different lives. Silicon Valley is a place with a laser focus on success, on money. It’s a high-octane rat race,” she remarks.
Finally, it could also boil down to money. While capital available is increasing, deal flow is still slow compared to other hubs. “Barcelona has great potential, however, I believe there is a need for a more virtuous circle of money flowing into the ecosystem for it to become the EU Valley,” said Priscilla Lavoie.
She also commented that, “while we have seen interesting exits in the last 5–10 years, the majority of large investors in these companies were from the US, UK, and France, so most of the money leaves Spain and doesn’t really support our ecosystem at home.”
Lena Shagieva also touches on this. “It can be an optic problem, or because money is expensive here, but at the end of the day, businesses need money and startups need to see actual deals happening — know people who have had big money exits,” she says.
The point of comparing many cities to Silicon Valley has been made countless times. Many places have been there — Tel Aviv, the Kitchener-Waterloo corridor, Austin and Seattle, to name a few. However, it is always a misleading comparison, because every city has unique aspects that contribute to its development or lack thereof.
Hence, the idea of Barcelona becoming the “Silicon Valley of Europe” is not accurate. Silicon Valley has singular conditions that result in a high concentration of unicorns, and setting such standards can create unrealistic expectations for Barcelona.
I rather endorse the vision of Luis Cabiedes, one of Spain’s most well-known VCs and angel investors, who states that Spain needs to develop its own model rather than trying to imitate Silicon Valley. In this regard, it is unlikely that Barcelona can rival Silicon Valley in scale. Yet, it still has the potential to become a significant player in the European tech landscape, and to do it in its own way — leveraging its strengths and distinctive advantages.

Gràcia, also known as the Vila de Gràcia (village of Grace) lives up to its name. Many years after its establishment, it is still a small, tranquil “village” in the middle of Barcelona’s vast, urban sprawl. Founded in 1626 as a convent, it wasn’t until 1897 that it became a part of Barcelona. That pivotal moment belongs to the larger story of Barcelona’s transition from small town to metropolis; other neighborhoods, such as Sants and Sarrià, are also formally independent municipalities that were annexed by Barcelona during Idefons Cerdà’s expansion of the city starting with his Eixample Plan in 1859.
Today, the neighborhood lives on as a peaceful zone that harbors small businesses and wards off through traffic. Gràcia’s extensive use of creative urban planning measures, like Salvador Rueda’s concept of “superblocks,” means that cars must share the streets with pedestrians, bikers, and children on scooters. It boasts more than 10 lovely plazas, where you can sit for a coffee or “far un vermut,” while kids play in front of you and their parents gossip beside you.
Though it is not one of the first neighborhoods listed in guidebooks, Gràcia is home to many treasures. Among them is the first home designed by Antoni Gaudì, Casa Vicens. Recognized as one of the Art Nouveau movement’s first buildings, it has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The house was originally built as a summer home for the Vicens family in the 1880s. It was closed to the public until 2017 when it opened as a museum. There is some mystery surrounding its patriarch, Señor Manuel Vicens i Montaner. Records indicate that he was a professional stockbroker and currency dealer, though many historians have referred to him as the owner of a tile factory. Given the tiles ostentatiously engulfing the exterior of the building, the latter is certainly plausible.
In 1992, an air-raid shelter was discovered beneath Gràcia’s Plaça del Diamant. The planes’ main targets were the many factories once situated throughout the area. The shelter protected more than 200 people during the Spanish Civil War and is one of the biggest of the 1,300 shelters that were built in Barcelona during that time. Guided tours are offered every Sunday at 11 AM, but reservations must be made online.
Gràcia is a more bohemian-natured neighborhood. Walking around you will notice many shops with hand-painted murals on their doors. One could say this makes it an outdoor art gallery in and of itself. Some of the murals are exquisite works of art, relating to the store’s offerings. You’ll also come across colorful beer cans painted with quotes and pinned to the walls of buildings. These inspiration messages and love notes are done by a mysterious, unknown couple with a beautiful love story.
Gràcia has several shopping promenades where you’re sure to find many small boutiques and artisanal shops. Start at Olokuti on Carrer d’Astúries. This general store sells just about everything and its wares are produced using sustainable materials and processes. Even if you aren’t interested in buying something, there is a beautiful secret garden, accessible from the back of the store.
For clothing, continue down Astúries to La Comet, a small, independent boutique full of made-in-Barcelona pieces and gorgeous gold jewelry. Others to check out are Ktu Barcelona and Padam, as well as Natural Mediterrani, which sells natural soaps and bath products.
Carrer de Verdi links up with Carrer d’Astúries, just past Plaça del Diamant. If you’re looking for great shoes, try Vialis, Mauro’s BCN or Streeters. Salvador Mallol Joier, Bell Estiu, and Pia Barcelona have exquisite jewelry. For clothing, take a peek at Vos Shop and KLING.
Carrer de Bona Vista is another area for fashion finds, with a few more upscale, haute couture shops. POISON Jewels sells one-of-a-kind adornments. Be Store has great gifts for friends and family. Browse BOO, IKA, and Mushi Mushi if you’re looking for quality, locally-crafted clothing. Rêveries has a variety of vintage luxury items. At the end of the street, turn right onto Passeig de Gràcia and you’ll find Lupo, another local atelier, which makes all of its handbags in-house.
Let me follow this by telling you that Gràcia is also a foodie haven. Smaller versions of the well-known Boqueria, Mercat de la Llibertat and Mercat de l’Abaceria are located on the neighborhood’s borders. In the middle, an old, run-down market on Carrer de Puigmartí is being renovated. As for restaurants, there are simply too many homey, independent, quirky establishments to tell all, but I can highlight a few of my favorites.
Mama’s Cafe offers an excellent American-style breakfast, with great coffee and a small backyard garden. For lunch, Taverna el Glop and Il Giardinetto Di Gracia have tasty, very Catalan dishes. If you go during the week you can experience what is known as “el menu del dia.” For the best pizza in Barcelona, sit down at Garden Pizza by Rafa Panattieri, a Brazilian-Italian chef with ties to the famous Roca Brothers.
El Cafè del Teatre and Chatelet are both wonderful, cozy spots to stop in the late afternoon for a glass of wine before heading to a movie at Cines Verdi, which shows many English-language movies with Spanish subtitles.
Bodega Quimet serves up traditional tapas at good prices and with their house wine. At the end of your meal, you can even take home a bottle of what you’ve tried — the concept is to taste the wines accompanied by small snacks. La Xula Taperia is a more modern, Mediterranean-fusion, experimental take on Catalan tapas.
Plenty of places for a nightcap can be found just by strolling around. But some no-fail recommendations are Viblioteca, whose play-on-words title explains itself, and El Ciclista, the area’s staple hipster cocktail bar. At Bobby Gin you can try variations on Spain’s favorite cocktail, gin & tonic.
Looking for live music? Take your pick: Soda Acústic, Cueva de Lobos, and La Sonora de Gràcia are all reputed venues, though be prepared to snuggle up to strangers if you so choose. If you’d like to move your feet, Gràcia Latina and El Sabor are there for a salsa dancing adventure.
Catalunya and the rest of Spain take their partying very seriously.
If you’re lucky enough to arrive in Barcelona during August, you may get to join in celebrating Gràcia’s biggest party of the year. During summer, each of Barcelona’s neighborhoods puts on a several-day block party, known as the “Festa Major.”
In Gràcia, locals spend weeks preparing for their August party, by building elaborate decorations and stages out of recycled materials. Restaurants sell food and drinks, and musicians and DJs play concerts on almost every corner. The annual festival even has its own website and office space to organize the event.
The best way to arrive is via metro. Though there are no metro stations directly in the center, Gràcia is accessible by the L3 (the green line), L4 (the yellow line), and L5 (the blue line). Metro stations Diagonal and Verdaguer have their exits at the bottom border of the neighborhood, while Joanic and Fontana are further up on Gràcia’s outer edges. Once you get there, you’ll enjoy meandering in as it will give you the chance to experience more of the area on foot, which is exactly how it should be.

As a teenager, my favourite Vietnamese restaurant was ‘Lucky Star’. This tiny hole in the wall can be found in Balmain, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, Australia.
For some strange reason, the place had a fascination for global music. Every year, they’d slap posters all over their walls of tours, festivals and everything in between. There was one poster in particular that always had a prime position amongst the clutter. PRIMAVERA SOUND. Names like Tame Impala, The Strokes, Radiohead, Flying Lotus and Dixon would always glare down at me, while I slurped down won ton soup. Artists I’d been dreaming of seeing for years and years. In just over a week these dreams become reality!
Here’s why I can’t wait to attend Primavera Sound 2019, and it’d be fantastic to see you there too!
If it was the lineup that first won me over, it was the festival’s location that really got me drooling. Situated in the north-east of Barcelona, this expertly designed space was put together to host events of epic proportions.
Picture a beautiful labyrinth of concrete, an amphitheatre, a beach space and comfy grass spots. From what I’ve been told (by many overly excited friends) the space feels like a vortex, drawing you further and further in. Imagine clambering to the top of a hill for a better view of Erykah Badu, then stumbling through a passage and popping out in the midst of a rave thanks to Job Jobse. Let me remind you, there’s a place to kick off your shoes and dance with sand between your toes (I mean who doesn’t love that)? I could blab on and on about a venue I haven’t even set foot in, but like they say the ‘proof is the pudding’. And for some reason, I just know the pudding’s going to be delicious!
This one speaks for itself. Barcelona is an outstanding city! From stunning beaches, scrumptious tapas, pumping nightlife and Gaudi’s insane architectural feats it’s full of diversity. For me, this sounds like the perfect day on earth; wake up, head for a Spanish bocadillo, next pick up some beers and ice with one goal in mind — the beach. Post swim, head home to shower and refresh, arriving at Primavera just in time to see Pusha T take the Main Stage. Undoubtedly, this will be one of the better days you’ve had in quite some time.
One of the biggest drawcards to festivals these days is their vibe. Statements like “beaming sunshine, full of smiles, totally free” get thrown around all the time. It’s often hard to work out which of these blanket claims you can trust but in Primavera’s case, the mountain of good word spoken it can’t be ignored.
I’ll often probe my friends who’ve been and ask why it’s such a magical feel and most say something like “I don’t know there’s just something in the air”. Of course, the artists involved and curation is key but you really can’t put a price on an authentic feeling of enjoyment! I guess it has to be seen to be believed.
I mean I alluded to this in the intro but it goes without saying there’s seemingly an artist for everyone at Primavera. If you’re a rap lover — there’s Nas, a soul diva — there’s Solange, a pop hound — there’s Miley Cyrus or an underground club connoisseur — there’s Anthony Naples. There’s an overall level of calm about the lineup every year as it’s always golden.
If you’re an expert planner, you’ll spend 72 hours basking in the Barca sunshine, chasing your favourite artists from stage to stage. There are that many people booked, I’m expecting there’ll never be a dull moment.

I don’t know what about you guys, but personally, I have started to accept life in another way. What do I mean?! As an international student in Europe from a Central Asian country, Kyrgyzstan, my life has changed significantly since I moved to Spain, specifically to Barcelona. My first impression of this city was, and still is, that it is amazing — at least in my eyes. Barcelona is a huge Instagramable museum. The architecture, (Dear Antoni Gaudi, you truly created masterpieces), the sea, beaches, people, palm trees, the transportation system, the climate, food, and Catalan culture — everything here has given me nothing but pleasure.
I mean… I could start blogging about my life while living here, but I found it a bit nonsense. While I have posted several photos on my instagram, I started to contemplate that I need to really live here, and not spend my precious time taking pictures of every single meter of square. It is hard to resist capturing touristy places, but I can only reiterate how meaningful it is to live the moment and save those moments in your real memory, not just your phone’s.
Last night, I came up with an idea to incorporate into my daily routine to live my dream life. I have grasped that we are only getting old day by day, living either in our past or in future dreams. For instance, I have always wanted to have free time to read a book unrelated to my studies and enjoy it. So I can dedicate an hour to that, live my dream life, and savor every minute of it with joy.
So now I know what to do — change my perception of life, live my dreams in reality, and take as much of it as possible. In an hour, I am meeting with my friend to walk around and see Christmas lights on Passeig de Gracia, and be present both physically and mentally, using all other types of sensations — fully diving into the atmosphere.
Thank you! I wish you peace and love!
Your Aizi-Daisy!

While walking spontaneously through the streets of Barcelona, the capital city on the coast of northeastern Spain, my partner and I of Goodspero, two multi-media creatives from Houston, Texas, US in town to film alongside Geoffrey Moskowitz of Fat Cat Productions, and his clients, Sean Kinney and Catherine Sbeglia of RCRWireless News at the MWC (Mobile World Congress), the world’s largest tech conference/exhibition for the mobile industry (which was cancelled a few days before we arrived due to fears of the coronavirus)— we happened to stumble upon The World of Banksy in Espacio Trafalgar.
Between filming, editing, social media, writing and otherwise catching up on our work during down-time now that the conference was cancelled, and while walking back to our host’s apartment in the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), to grab our laptops and head to the nearest cafe, we caught a glimpse of a sign named after one of our favorite street artists, also a political activist and film director. While crossing the street we decided to take a quick detour and slip into the building through the open glass door — plus I spotted a restroom sign inside and desperately needed to use the bathroom.
Upon walking in I assumed the building was some sort of lobby, perhaps for living quarters, or one of the many private corridors with street art adorning the walls. We never imagined that we had just walked into a press/media day preview for the newest Banksy themed art exhibition featuring 100+ works inspired by the artist that was set to open the next day (February 25, 2020).
I completely ignored the fact that I had to relieve myself as we found ourselves immersed in Banksy art the moment we walked in. I thought, “what an AMAZING public art display”, oblivious to the fact that we had inadvertently snuck into a private and closed building (never mind the keys hanging on the front door which I paid no mind to regardless of my partner’s questioning whether or not we should be in there). I was already far too captivated by all the art.
While taking in all the familiar pieces in the first room, including text printed on the wall in multiple languages that quoted the artist:
“I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal, and amend my art for amusement, academic research, or activism…”
I snapped photos of a replica of one of my favorite stencil pieces, “Girl with Balloon”, first spotted in London and has since been used by the anonymous artist to support various social campaigns including the Syrian refugee crisis and the Israeli West Bank Barrier.
It was also the piece infamously destroyed by Banksy who had a shredder hidden in a frame that was set off immediately after the piece was sold during a live auction of his work. The anonymous European woman who bought the piece for £1,042,000 ($1,346,652 USD) before it self-destructed, ended up keeping the artwork and was quoted saying she now owned her “own piece of art history”.
Down the hall, multiple “Kissing Coppers”, depict two male British police officers kissing, another favorite stencil graffiti art piece of ours originally spotted on a bar in Brighton, England, known to many as the LGBTQ Capital of the UK. The original piece was vandalized multiple times thanks to the country’s attitudes towards homosexuality at the time and the piece was eventually and controversially removed and sold by the bar owner who put up a replica in it’s place a little over a decade ago. As an entrepreneur, I supposed I can appreciate that he reportedly used the approximate half a million dollars in profits to continue sustaining his business.
Before moving on to the second floor, my partner and I snapped a photo imitating “Mobile Lovers”, one of the featured stencil pieces on a wall blocked off by a chain and a couple of steps below the first floor at the far end of the room. It’s of a couple embracing with their faces lit up by the lighting coming from their cell phones which they’re holding behind each other’s backs. A perfect depiction of us in our worlds. Some may look at this piece and think it’s sad — to me, it’s beautiful. Not many would understand or feel the same way but I see my partner and I in our natural state. Our video and social media business and the freedom we have to work from Barcelona and to work with each other daily wouldn’t be possible without our mobile phones — nor would we be here, enjoying this exhibition thanks to MWC 2020. Just another unpopular opinion perhaps.
Upstairs in the next exhibition room there are several moving pieces that I’m left too drained to describe. The political nature and social narratives in each piece on display remind me of all the reasons I left the 9–5 world and began a creative career with the goal of shining a light on the many messages and injustices often left unspoken. A world in which I’m now able to create, write about and share visual art in many forms that educates and inspires others to take action in order to leave a social impact on our world.
I haven’t yet reached the level of focusing on controversial works like the “Toxic Mary” pieces of the exhibition, in which the Virgin Mary is feeding baby Jesus a bottle of poison. Nevertheless, these pieces are dear to me for reasons other than what it was perhaps originally intended to portray — the toxic nature of religion. To me, as a child-free by choice woman, living in a world that encourages even young girls to pop out babies left and right “because you’ll never know what love is until then”, I am drawn to visuals and texts that are even remotely anti-baby or anti-motherhood. I am 100% pro-otherhood. Anti-religion aside — I must stop here and thank the curator for including these works in the exhibition.
And even non-Banksy fans can surely appreciate, “Christ with Shopping Bags”. Because really — what better way is there to celebrate Christmas in our typical consumerist societies than to shop excessively in the name of Jesus and “love” and making children, family and friends “happy” — and for many — getting into even more debt, or staying in debt, until the next holiday.
By the time you make it downstairs and into the most immersive parts of this exhibition, you have only been given a taste of Banky’s art through stencils, a few physical incorporations of flowers, grass, paper and magazine photos protruding from some of the pieces among other items. There are even a few auditory police sirens encased in crates and other surprises I’ll leave up to your multi-sensory experiencing pleasure once you actually visit this detailed exhibition.
Be sure not to miss the elaborate displays downstairs at the bottom of the building — we almost did. Were it not for spontaneously running into the gracious exhibition’s curator, Haziz Vardar, we would have completely missed it. Not only did Haziz not immediately kick us out of the private and mind you, closed, press viewing once realizing we hadn’t been invited by Rosa(?), but he and his partner happily shared Banksy stories with us about having started the exhibition in Paris last month in January and how the one we were standing in was set to open to the public in the morning. Not a friend of Banksy, but immediately a friend of ours, Haziz welcomed our intrusion and invited us to continue walking around, encouraging us to take pictures, post them to Instagram, and to go downstairs and let the staff know we were “friends of Haziz” so they’d give us a little gift bag with perhaps a book or surprise inside. We were not disappointed and left with a canvas bag with the “Kids on Guns Hill” print, a matching magnet and a book from the exhibition (pictured at the end of this article below).
We would never have imagined some of the best pieces were yet to be seen in an entire floor underground. There’s a replica of a room in “The Walled Off Hotel” downstairs featuring a painting of an Israeli border policeman and a Palestinian in a pillow fight above an actual bed, identical to the one Banksy created in one of nine rooms in one of his largest artworks — a Palestinian boutique hotel in Bethlehem boasting “the worst view in the world”. It’s a hotel in front of a concrete wall built by Israel that encages Bethlehem. Although it was meant to be a temporary hotel/artwork, it has become one of the town’s top tourist attractions, blatantly educating its visitors of the daily life and confinement of Palestinians facing Israel’s military infrastructure.
Please friends (and strangers alike) — especially those left stranded in Barcelona without as much work as originally planned thanks to the wonderful coronavirus fears, you MUST stop by this exhibition. Grab a book as you “Exit Through the Gift Shop” on your way out. As the BNKSY & Artwork’s book states, the entire experience is “100% unauthorized by Banksy” — much like our approptiate and literal “sneak peek” of this exhibition in the beautiful Barcelona. Vale.

Barcelona is the cosmopolitan capital of Spain’s Catalonia region. And while the food, wine, architecture, and culture in Barcelona alone may keep you busy, there is so much in the surrounding area worth exploring.
High up on my list were (1) the picturesque mountains of Montserrat and (2) cava wine cellars in the heart of Penedès
(1) Montserrat is situated approximately 30 miles northwest of Barcelona which makes it a perfect candidate for a day trip.
(2) Located 30 miles southwest of Barcelona, the Penedès wine region is home to more than 140 wine producers. It’s most well-known for its sparkling wine: cava
While you can access the foot of the Montserrat mountain via a ~1 hr train ride, I opted for a small group tour with Viator for ~$100 per person (link here)
Clearly, this tour matched a lot of my needs, and if you’re in a similar boat, I’d highly recommend it. Read on for details of my experience!
After a short one hour drive from Barcelona and many winding roads, we arrived at the beautiful Montserrat Monastery. We were given a brief history lesson before having free reign to explore on our own and only a hard-stop time to re-board the tour bus to proceed to Part 2 of the tour (cava cellar visit).
We actually got there before the other tour groups/crowds arrived, so my friend Julie and I briefly visited the Montserrat Monastery to pay our respects to the Black Virgin, a 12th century religious icon, before traversing up to the peak of the mountain.
We purchased single one-way tickets for the Sant Joan funicular to go to the top of the mountain, where there are many hiking options. While you can assent to the Sant Jeroni peak and get an even higher vantage point, that hike takes approximately 2 hrs, and we didn’t have that sort of energy in the blistering summer heat (nor the proper footwear).
We chose the “hike” from Sant Jeroni back to the Montserrat Monastery (labeled “Sant Jeroni — Monestir de Montserrat” on the little map at the funicular), which was a nice 40 minute walk back down to the monastery. We were rewarded with beautiful 360 degree views of Catalonia as we wound our way back down the mountain. Would highly recommend!
As a budding wine enthusiast, I couldn’t pass up this opportunity to visit a cava (Spanish sparkling wine) cellar in the heart of Penedès, the largest wine-producing region in Catalonia and the home of Spanish sparkling wine, cava.
I thought it was incredibly special that we visited Codorniu, as this was the first documented winery to create cava using the typical grapes found in cava (Macabeo, Xarel-lo, and Paralellada). And the oldest family-owned business in Spain (dating back to 1551).
I absolutely loved this portion of the tour and would not trade the experience for anything.
We had the opportunity to learn about the production process of cava sparkling wine, ride a train through the labyrinth of underground cellars, and taste Codorniu’s most recent releases. It was highly educational, and fun too!
Thank you for reading about my day-trip to Montserrat and the cava cellars!

Stories and learnings from the team behind Qonto

At Qonto, borders are no barrier to talent.
And with Spain being voted the best European country for expats, it’s no surprise that a growing number of those working in our Barcelona office hail from outside of Cervantes’ country. As of October 2023, 96 of those at Qonto Barcelona were from somewhere other than Spain, representing 28 countries from across the world.
It’s a melting pot of cultures, views, skills, and languages spoken.
But what’s the reality for those making the move? What’s it like when Spain becomes your full-time home, rather than a holiday haunt?
Hear from five Qontoers who switched their native nation for Catalonia’s capital.
Making light work of paperwork
Relocating can feel exhilarating and exciting; a voyage of discovery. When moving from abroad with Qonto, there’s always a dedicated point person to help you navigate the thornier challenges that can present themselves, relieving any bureaucratic stress.
This applies from the very first contact, with an interview process French native and Qonto Fraud Agent Felix Gleizes describes as “very quick. My Talent Manager, Andrea, kept in close communication with me, and I quickly had my first interviews with my future manager. Andrea was able to answer all my questions and support me throughout the process, putting me in touch with members of my team to facilitate my move.”
Every foreign resident in Spain will have a unique Número de Identidad de Extranjero (NIE) — an individual ID document required by the Spanish government. It’s needed for everything from opening a bank account to setting up internet, phone, and utilities.
Forget wading through papers and trying to make sense of a new country’s rules and regulations; the Qonto People team in Barcelona is on hand to support new movers in applying for and securing their NIE and their social security number.
It was an invaluable add-on for Salma Kosbr, Customer Success Manager for VIP clients, who grew up in Paris. “Qonto helped me to get my NIE card, as well as helping me to get my empadronamiento [the process of being added to Barcelona’s resident census], which was really helpful.”
Qonto’s People team’s wealth of knowledge offers valuable reassurance, which is often needed when making a life change. As Martin Velly, Countering the Financing of Terrorism Officer at Qonto, shares, “During the relocation process, I was confident that I was in good hands, and I just went with the flow to discover step by step where my feet would land.”
It’s not just the legal paperwork that you’ll get support with. Qonto partners with global mobility company, Santa Fe Relocation Services, to set new joiners up in their very own homes.
And when it comes to the extra expenses incurred when you move somewhere new, there’s an allowance made for that, too: “I received a relocation package from Qonto, which helped me a lot to move all my belongings from Paris to Barcelona, so I could save a lot of money and start fresh,” Salma shares.
With numerous other international colleagues in the office who have gone through the same expatriation process, you’re never short of someone to seek informal advice from; whether you want to know about the most desirable neighborhood to live in, or you’re seeking the best local spots for tapas.
English: the lingua franca
When you’re relocating to a new place, language will naturally be a consideration. And in the case of Barcelona, two languages are in circulation; Castilian and Catalan.
But those who don’t know their ‘perros’ from their ‘peros’ needn’t be discouraged.
English is the official language in the Qonto office; it’s the language in which meetings and most socials take place. According to Martin — a non-native Spanish speaker — ”The office in Barcelona is really international. Everyone speaks English, but if you’re willing to relocate to Spain, you’re likely to have a curiosity for the language. In that sense, the office is a perfect tower of Babel, with many languages spoken and the chance to try out your skills in an informal setting.”
In Salma’s view, “To get a truly international experience, Barcelona is amazing. But if you’re hoping to go further, and live the Spanish life, I’d say it’s valuable to learn the language, to get under the skin of the culture.”
And Qonto facilitates this cultural exploration, for those who have the desire to flex their linguistic muscles. Language lessons are provided free by Qonto partner Busuu. “Busuu is perfect for any Qontoers living abroad and willing to learn,” Martin comments. “It’s a platform which offers personal, live classes with a teacher where you can practice your speaking. Having that dedicated one-on-one time is one of the best ways to get comfortable in a new language. It’s a great benefit, whether you’re using it because you wish to communicate with Spanish natives socially, or because you want to broaden your professional horizons.”
Teamwork makes the dream work
A big pull for many candidates considering relocating to Barcelona is the strength of Qonto’s people. Taking up a new position is made easier when you’re confident that you’ll be shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates who are motivated to achieve great things.
This was true for Salma, who was aware of Qonto’s reputation before joining. “Knowing that I’d be working among some of the most knowledgable people in the industry was a real selling point for me when it came to moving to Barcelona to take up this role.”
And for Eleonora Cusanno, who looks after Qonto onboarding for the Italian market, it was a very quick settling-in process in among her peers. “Once I started and I met my colleagues, I felt immediately part of the team and supported. The people here are brilliant, highly talented, and very friendly. When you start a new job, it’s really important to know that you’re surrounded by a strong cohort of colleagues who are there to help you grow — and vice versa. That was the case with my team here at Qonto.”
Sea, city…and start-ups
While Barcelona is a popular vacation destination, with its ‘fun in the sun’ reputation — it’s a city of cerebral substance, too.
A wellspring of start-ups have settled in the Catalonian center, giving it serious credentials as a bustling hub of innovation. Qonto — with its status as a scale-up leading the market as a business finance solution — counts among its number of fast-growing and exciting enterprises.
Qonto’s office, located in a co-working space in central Barcelona, is equipped for both work and wellbeing, with yoga classes, meditation sessions, self-serve snacks, and drinks on offer.
It’s an environment where the pursuit of parity is front and center, with a 44% female workforce compared with 17% in the tech sector overall.
And the Qonto culture is carefully designed around making new connections. For Julie Santanoceto, who moved from Toulouse, France to Spain to take up the role of Anti Money Laundering Officer, making friends happened naturally. “The office is very international and diverse. There are always lots of colleagues who are newly arrived in Barcelona, so it’s easy to meet people and integrate.”
Events hosted in and outside of the office create natural moments to mix with new colleagues socially. Evening entertainment runs the gamut from paint and tapas evenings to escape room excursions, with Qontoers free to sign up to whichever activity appeals to their tastes. Martin describes the recent appointment of a dedicated Qonto event planner as “life-changing, because out-of-office activities help us to develop deeper bonds.”
With sangria served on tap (to be enjoyed outside of working hours!) and a sun-soaked rooftop terrace complete with fuzball table, the office is a place where work and play meet.
Living la vida catalana
Though the Qonto office is well kitted-out, life doesn’t start and end in the workplace. Being in a bustling city like Barcelona means plenty of opportunities to enjoy all that the metropolis has to offer.
It’s a place steeped in history and art, perfect for those wanting to get up close and personal with culture. Barcelona plays host to more than 80 museums — perhaps unsurprising, in the city that was central to the Modernism movement — as well as 100 different beaches, from stretches of silky golden sands to hidden rocky coves.
Felix describes weekday evenings spent enjoying the Barcelona beachfront. “Having the sea just 10 minutes from the office means you’ve got a great way to relax and recoup after work, right on your doorstep. And it’s also a perfect place to go out with friends at the weekends.”
Swapping Brussels for Barcelona meant that Martin could find much-sought work-life balance. “In Qonto, for most positions, you have the option work remotely and to adapt your schedules, to a certain degree. Everything is put in place for you to find a good alchemy between work and everything else. As an example, during spring and summer, you will see some Qontoers starting their day early to go to the beach in the afternoon. Others with children successfully balance work and a quality family life.”
For Julie, the reality of living in a seaside city matched her expectations. “I dreamt of Barcelona as a sunny, vibrant place — and it is! There’s a lot to do, and the winter weather is delightful when you come from somewhere like France.”
And there are other, more practical, benefits. “Of course there’s the good weather — but there’s also well-managed public transport,” says Salma. “It takes me 35 minutes to get to the office, door to door. In Paris, even by car, 35 minutes is unheard of!”
Thinking of moving?
Finally, when it comes to words of wisdom, lived experience is often the best teacher. And the verdict from Qonto’s Barcelona-based expats is unequivocal.
“The relocation to Barcelona was very easy. I felt safe making this change, knowing that I had Qonto supporting me,” explains Eleonora. “I would definitely recommend moving to Barcelona to work. The atmosphere here is exciting, there are people from all over the world in the office, and the cultural scene is very lively and buzzy.”
When it comes to superlatives, Felix places the city at the top of the list for international workers. “For me, it’s one of the best European cities to move to as an expatriate. Even though it’s a regional capital, it’s still a city on a human scale.”
Martin found that his own high hopes around life in Spain were surpassed. “The reality at Qonto Barcelona is beyond my expectations. I really quickly got used to my new environment and found a life-work balance which makes me happy. I do not regret for a second having taken this decision.”

On February 17th, I got the opportunity to see my first Barcelona football match. I attended FC Barcelona vs Rayo Vallecano, a big cultural event in the city. The game took place at the Estadi Olímpic and it was packed with loud Barca fans. We arrived at the stadium about an hour early and there were already tons of fans lined up in line, we could already tell this was going to be a special experience. As we got to our seats we were surrounded by Barca fans who greeted us kindly. The game had finally started and the crowd was very energetic. They were all doing chants in unison and showing that they all had a shared passion. I observed very early that this was way different than anything I had seen in the United States.
As someone who is pretty big in sports, I would think it would be like a typical sporting event. One that I saw immediately was the group orientation from both the Barca and Rayo Vallecano fans. While watching the game, it was almost a cooler experience being part of the crowd and the chants were far more important that my individual enjoyment of the match. I believe that one of the main reasons that these fans come to the game is to actively participate and engage together, something that was way more emphasized than in the United States.
In most sports in the US, many people arrive at the game close to when it starts (with the exception of some tailgating). They watch the game and then leave, everything is in a timely manner. Though, at this game I noticed that people were not as worried about time, they were enjoying their experience and spending quality time with their family and friends.
As the game went on, I always started to catch on to how the fans reacted to each other. The conversations were high-context. It was less direct contact but more cheering shouting chants that everyone knew. It seemed like they knew the team so well that they didn’t have to say too much to show their loyalty to the team. In the US, it’s way more of a low-context culture. In many of the sporting events I have been to, there is often a lot of small talk and questions going on during the games. I found myself adapting to the communication from the people beside me and trying to immerse myself in their culture.
At one point in the game I began to talk to the person beside me and we had a great conversation. I asked him how long he had been a Barca fan. He smiled and said, “All my life.”
He was curious about me too, asking how I ended up here. After I told him, he laughed and said, you came to the right place. Then he decided it was time to teach me a famous chant. “Blaugrana al vent, un crit valent, tenim un nom el sap tothom: Barça, Barça, Baaarça!” which in english stands for “Blue and claret blowing in the wind, One valiant cry, We’ve got a name that everyone knows: Barça, Barça, Baaarça!”
I did my best to keep up but the sound of the stadium was incredible.
As we talked, one thing stuck with me was his best moment as a Barca fan. He said “1992, European Cup final, Koeman’s free kick” he claimed that when it went in, the whole city went crazy. See video below…
FC Barcelona — Sampdoria 1–0 — All Goals & Highlights — UCL Final 1992. YouTube, uploaded by Classic Football, 18 Dec. 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_zRwnaXaNs.
I had seen that goal before, scrolling through YouTube but hearing it from someone who lived it was different.
As we continued watching, the tension in the stadium was built up with every pass. Then, in the 22nd minute, Robert Lewandowski was set to take a penalty and placed a shot into the back of the net. The release of noise from the crowd was crazy. The crowd stood up on their feet calling his name as the announcer drew out the classic “Goooooool!” for what felt like forever.
Despite being in the lead, Rayo Vallecano never let down. Whenever Rayo held onto the ball for a bit too long, the Barca supporters made them know they were present by whistling loudly, reminding everyone that their team owned the possession. The passion in the stands was as intense as the match being played on the field.
The second half was dramatic. Barcelona enjoyed the possession but couldn’t break into a solid Rayo defense. Each missed opportunity was met with respective groans. For me, I had placed a sports bet for Raphnha to score. After his 4th missed one on one I had almost given up on their ability.
With the last whistle approaching, the game remained dangerously open. Rayo pushed in the dying minutes but when the referee finally blew full time, a wave of relief swept over the crowd.
When the match was over, my friends didn’t feel like leaving yet. The chants were still echoing through the air, and the atmosphere of the fans hadn’t yet faded. But I saw something — Rayo Vallecano’s fans were still standing in their area, not moving. I realized soon that they weren’t allowed to leave until the Barca fans had evacuated the stadium. It was a protective move, chasing away any potential fights. I had never seen that happen before, but it was not hard to see given the level of competition. We hung around for a while, watching how the traveling fans slowly disappeared.
While we waited, my friend and I brainstormed. We noticed a stadium worker standing around the field and figured we’d try him out to see if he’d allow us to take a picture down there. We walked up, trying to look as casual as possible and asked.
He laughed and told us it’s against the rules.
We didn’t give up. At this point we genuinely wanted to know about his career, so we asked how long he had been working here.
He laughed, “I’ve worked here at the stadium for about 12 years. I started out in maintenance, but then I got the field security job, so I’m here for all the big games.”
He said he had grown up playing soccer when he was a kid but couldn’t quite make it as a pro, but he loved the game. He said “It’s a dream come true to be involved in it.”
After some more back-and-forth, he finally relented and let us take the picture.
We made our way out onto the grass, and I found myself just standing there for a moment, completely taking it all in. Standing on the field where so many things had happened throughout history was surreal. As I walked away from the stadium, I couldn’t help but think how much of an experience it was. Overall the experience was great. I’m glad I was able to attend the game through CEA CAPA.

Last month we spent five fun filled days in Barcelona and found five different things to do if you’ve finished all the top tourist spots in Barcelona, or if like us, this wasn’t your first time and you wanted to mix it up a little bit!
The Kissing Wall is an art installation in the Gothic Quarter down a little passage. It is a photo mosaic created by the people of Barcelona to commemorate the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 which ended The War or Spanish Succession. The people of Barcelona have contributed photos which show ‘moments of freedom’ and it is a mesmerising piece of art work which you can explore forever.
“The sound of a kiss is not as loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a great deal longer”, Oliver Wendall Holmes.
2. Drinks at H10
So, yes, the W Hotel in Barcelona does have a lovely view of the beach, but it also has a lovely view of the financial district and the shipping lanes… How would you like to have a drink at a roof top bar in the middle of the Gothic Quarter with views of La Catedral, La Sagrada Familia and downtown Barcelona? Interested? Good!
H10 is a hotel situated on the edge of the Gothic Quarter and it is free for tourists to visit and have a drink. It’s not a high as the W or as fancy pants inside but then also not as expensive and you can sit outside on the deck with the sun on your face (it also has a plunge pool, wink wink!!). The views of La Catedral, are stunning as are the rest of the 180 degrees. This trumped our trip to the W in a big way and we would highly recommend an early evening beverage here!
3. Sagrat Cor
Sagrat Cor has one of the best views over Barcelona hands down, toes down, head down. It is only a 20 minute bus journey out of town and takes you to a different Barcelona (you catch the T2A from Placa de Catalunya).
Sagrat Cor is the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and located on the peak of Mount Tibidabo. You can walk to the top or you can get a lift and you have a 360 degree view stretching from the beach to the hills behind Barcelona. Sagrat Cor also has a mini Christ the Redeemer right on the tip, so if you haven’t quite made it to Rio yet this might satisfy the cravings slightly.
Also located at the top of Mount Tibidabo is a small amusement park, so if you fancy grabbing an ice cream and jumping on the Ferris Wheel you can enjoy this view being a 12 year old again.
4. Japanese food
Our hotel was located north of the Ramblas by about a 10 minute walk and when you walk this far you luckily fall into the Japanese district which has some amazing Japanese food. If you’re full to the brim of Tapas and Paella then we would highly recommend venturing this way and stopping off for a nibble of sushi or tempura.
Top Tip: Restaurant Japonès Toyo has an all you can eat sushi train for ONLY 10 EUROS!! So if you like us and love a little bit of Yo Sushi but only limit yourself to a couple of plates because you don’t want to take out another mortgage, this is the place for you. There will be a queue, it might be around 10/15mins but it is worth the wait. We have to admit we ventured here twice for lunch because the food is insane and SO reasonable!
5. The Olympic Swimming Pool
Now, last but not least is the Olympic Swimming Pool. Why would you want to go to an old Olympic Swimming Pool from 1992 (before Camilla was even born!)? Why wouldn’t you? It is located at the top of a hill which you can get a cable car to the top off to save those precious legs of yours and the views are amazing. What’s even better is that if you go in August you are able to swim in the pool and appreciate the views while bobbing around!
Hopefully, if you are looking for something to do off the beaten track, this has sparked some ideas for you! Barcelona is such a vibrant city and there is so much to do other than the Gaudi Park and eat Tapas (although those two things are must do’s when in this pulsating city).

Barcelona is a boom. A buzz. A blast. A beach where tourists bask in the sun and a hub that draws expats, freelancers, and digital nomads to the golden shores of the Spanish Mediterranean. A hometown where the Catalans speak a language the French are as confused by as the Spanish, with whom some disagree on identity and others proudly identify as one.
A conurbation brimming with black-and-yellow-painted taxi cabs, and green Bolts, and sleek Ubers, and motorcycles, and scooters, and bikes, and roller-skaters, unicycle riders — and commuters and vacationers of all sorts and moods who hum and buzz and zip and cruise around town on the big streets along the grid that defines this city, which the locals know by heart and whose vastness reminds tourists of the duration of their stay.
Where walking beats driving and busses whir like subway cars, making weird noises when stopping, and pedestrians cross the street every chance they get because to obey a red light is to follow traffic rules — and what are traffic rules but annoyances meant to be broken? Where architecture is art and art is in every corner and alleyway, and Gaudí’s buildings use whipped cream instead of cement, and green wooden shutters hang from the peremptory façades of old, 19th-century buildings, chock-full of locals and…

“Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.” — Anita Desai
Before moving to Barcelona, I thought I knew what to expect. I had mentally prepared myself for the late dinners and the siestas, researched culture in Spain and even used Duolingo to try to start learning the language (RIP Duo).
But no amount of research or prep could have fully prepared me for the reality of living here — where waiting for the walk sign is a sacred ritual, iced coffee is nearly nonexistent and people treat Mondays like a Saturday night.
Some of these things threw me off at first. Some still do. But every single one has taught me something about how people live here, and how different that is from life back home.
I grew up near New York City, where the rule of the streets is simple: if there’s no car coming, you walk. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve almost walked straight into traffic here, expecting others to follow, only to realize that I am the only one walking.
In Barcelona, people actually wait. Even when there’s no car in sight, even when the road is clear, they stand there, patiently, as if jaywalking isn’t a core part of urban culture. I respect it. I also physically cannot do it. It’s a habit too ingrained in me, and I’m sure the locals watch me cross on a red light and think, Ah yes, the American.
In the U.S., dinner at 6 or 7 PM is normal. In Barcelona? That’s mid-afternoon. Restaurants don’t even open for dinner until at least 8 PM, and most people don’t sit down to eat until 9 or 10.
But it’s not just the timing, it’s the pace. If you’re used to American-style service, where waiters check in every five minutes and bring the bill before you even ask, Barcelona will test your patience. Here, meals are slow, on purpose. No one is rushing to turn tables or push you out the door. You sit, you talk, you enjoy and when you’re ready, you wave the waiter down for the check.
At first, as a waiter myself, I found myself getting impatient. Why is no one bringing water? Where is the bill? But the more I’ve eaten here, the more I’ve realized — this is the point. Meals aren’t just about eating, they’re about being present. People take their time. They actually enjoy their food. They’re not speed-running dinner just to get to the next thing.
And maybe that’s something I should be learning from, instead of resisting.
I used to be a proud, iced coffee-dependent American. Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts were my second homes. The idea of drinking hot coffee in warm weather made no sense to me. And yet, here I am, ordering espressos like I’ve been doing it my whole life.
Something about sipping a tiny, strong coffee at a café instead of carrying around a massive iced latte just feels… right. I have accepted that iced coffee is a rarity here, and in return, I have gained an appreciation for sitting down, enjoying my coffee and pretending to be effortlessly European.
In the U.S., tipping is mandatory. In Spain? It’s almost nonexistent. You round up the bill maybe, but no one is expecting 20% for handing you a drink. As a waiter myself, this was one of the hardest things to adjust to.
The first few times I paid for a meal, I felt like a criminal. I wanted to leave something, anything, just to ease the guilt. But the more time I’ve spent here, the more I’ve realized that tipping isn’t part of the culture because wages are livable. People aren’t relying on tips to survive, and that is how it should be.
If it’s 60 degrees Fahrenheit in Syracuse, people are in shorts. In Barcelona, people are in scarves, boots and full winter coats.
Every time I step outside in a light sweater, I feel like there is a giant glowing sign above my head flashing “NOT A LOCAL.” I can practically hear the crowd chanting imposter! at me. Meanwhile, I am sweating.
It’s a small thing, but it’s made me realize just how much weather perception is cultural. In Barcelona, this is winter. In upstate New York? This is beach weather. I fear I may never feel cold again.
There are two kinds of people in Barcelona:
Seriously. Every time I walk through the city, I see people just relaxing. Having long lunches, chatting with friends, sipping drinks in the middle of the day. Meanwhile, in the U.S., hustle culture has everyone eating desk lunches and answering emails at 11 PM.
It’s made me think about work-life balance in a way I never have before. Here, people take their time. They enjoy their food, they enjoy their conversations, they enjoy their lives.
Honestly though? I think I might be a little too addicted to being busy to know how to slow down the way people do here.
In Spain, weekends are a suggestion. People go out on Mondays. And Wednesdays. Until 6 AM.
I do not understand this lifestyle. I have 9 AM Spanish class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which means going out until sunrise on a Monday is not an option. And yet, half my class doesn’t show up the next morning.
It’s not just the late nights, it’s the fact that people seem completely unfazed by them. I’ll overhear someone casually mention getting home at 7 AM, only to see them out again the next night like it’s nothing. How do they do it? I need answers.
A latte and a croissant for 4 euros. A full meal for less than $10.
I don’t know how I’m supposed to return to the U.S. and pay $15 for a mediocre sandwich after this. Every time I buy groceries here, I stare at the total like this can’t be right. The clothing stores are just as bad (or good, depending on your self-control). It’s like Spain wants me to spend every dime I own.
I fear I may never financially recover from this city.
The other day, it was raining, and my shopping bag broke in the middle of the street.
If this had happened in New York, people might have just stepped over my stuff, angry that I was in the way. Maybe someone would’ve even taken something.
But in Barcelona? People ran over to help. They held umbrellas over me, picked up my things, made sure I was okay. It caught me off guard. It made me rethink how I view strangers, how I interact with people, how small moments of kindness can completely change someone’s day.
Small plates of food that you can order endlessly, at any time of day? Why has the U.S. not adopted this?
Someone, please, bring tapas to America. I need them.
I came here expecting to adapt to a new culture. What I didn’t expect was how much it would make me rethink my own.
Barcelona has shown me that life doesn’t have to be rushed. That time spent lingering over a meal isn’t wasted. That work shouldn’t come at the cost of actually living. That strangers can be unexpectedly kind. That I can survive without iced coffee — although I will never stop missing it.
But more than anything, Barcelona has shown me what it means for a city to have life. To be filled with people who embrace every moment, whether it’s a long afternoon at a café, a heated fútbol match in a packed bar (thank you George Paynes) or a random band playing music on the streets of the Gothic Quarter or in the metro. There’s a constant energy here, a rhythm that never really stops and somehow, I’ve fallen right into it.
Eventually, I’ll leave this city. I’ll go back to routines that once felt normal. But something about the way I see things has changed, and I don’t think I can unlearn it. I think I’m missing Barcelona before I’ve even left.
Because once you’ve lived in a city that like this, that feels this alive, how am I supposed to go back to anything less?

For decades, FC Barcelona was not just a football club — it was a dynasty. With all-time legends Ronaldinho, Xavi, Iniesta, and Lionel Messi, they didn’t win; they defined an era. From the tiki-taka revolution under Pep Guardiola to countless Champions League titles, Barcelona was the gold standard of European football.
But in recent years, the club collapsed miserably. Financial crisis, shoddy signings, managerial instability, and the excruciating departure of Lionel Messi in 2021 put the club back on a downward slope. Would Barcelona ever recapture their glory days? Or had they for good lost ground to European giants Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich?
Now, 2025, and the club is rebuilding again. With the exciting new set of stars including Lamine Yamal, Pedri, and Gavi, Barcelona is revealing again the flash of its great past. Is it enough, though, to regain European dominance? Let us examine where Barcelona went astray — and why they might just be turning it around again.
At the height of their success, Barcelona’s supremacy was unconquerable. Under Guardiola, they showed a lovely but efficient brand of football. Ever since their 2015…

Career and life hacks from the McMaster alumni community

By Chris Wildgen, McMaster Alumna, travel writer, photographer and tour leader.
People often ask me whether they should go to Madrid or Barcelona. Both are fantastic cities and well worth visiting. With friends in both cities, it is very hard for me to choose.
While both offer museums, sports, nature, great food and wine, history and culture, each has its own personality, and there is definitely a strong rivalry — just ask soccer/football fans!
Barcelona was my first time in Spain when I did a home exchange that planted me in the heart of the tourist area near the Picasso Museum. Though it was January, it was busy and bustling. With almost everything within a thirty-minute walk, it was a great, central location.
Two main things differentiate Barcelona from Madrid. One is its location on the Mediterranean Sea. As a beach lover, I enjoyed visiting its smaller artist-dedicated museums (such as Picasso, Dali, or Miro) in the morning, followed by a lunch of fresh fish at a chiringuito on the beach. After lunch, the cement lounge chairs on the beach are an inviting place to have a siesta while enjoying the modern architecture along the seafront.
The second thing is the architecture of Antoni Gaudí, “God’s architect”, who is currently being considered for sainthood. A visit to la Sagrada Famiglia may convince anyone that it is well-deserved. A day can be spent just visiting this and his other buildings, with an afternoon spent in Parc Guell (advisable to pre-purchase tickets.) That Barcelona embraced Gaudí and his Catalan modernism reflects the spirit of the city.
Evening entertainment can include free concerts such as a free organ concert at the Cathedral or an event at the beautiful and fanciful Palau de la Música Catalana, where I attended a memorable performance by The Barcelona Guitar Trio and Dance.
From Barcelona, possible day trips in its region of Catalonia (Catalunya) are to Montserrat 11th century Catholic monastery, Dalí Museum in Figueres or Girona, Sitges, Girona and the Costa Brava.
Everything about Madrid reminds me that it is the capital of Spain. With its sophisticated yet confidently relaxed, big-city vibe, Madrid feels like a real city, not a tourist city. Full of wide boulevards and monumental buildings, it is both grand and accessible. From my hotel away from the city centre, I walked down the wide boulevard of Paseo de la Castellana, past monumental buildings such as the Bank of Spain, eventually turning on Gran Via to go towards the center.
Instead of turning on Gran Via, continuing on I arrived at Paseo del Prado and 3 world-famous museums –the Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Prado and the Reina-Sofia. Just a block away is one of my favourite city parks, the very large Parc Retiro. From early morning until late evening, people walk or run along the many intersecting paths, use the outdoor exercise area, visit the latest exhibition at the Crystal Palace, ride small boats in the mini lake in its center, or chat with friends while enjoying coffee at a café.
From there a 30-minute walk to the Royal Palace of Madrid goes through the geographical center of Spain (and the tourist center of Madrid) of Puerto Sol, which is full of restaurants, bars and shops.
For sports lovers (especially Real Madrid fans), the Real Madrid Museum and football (soccer) pitch are memorable, but it is even better to attend a game, especially if it is against Barcelona to experience the very strong rivalry between the capital of Catalonia and the capital of Spain.
Restaurants represent all regions from Spain, with fresh seafood from Galicia and the Mediterranean and wine from the entire country, though Rioja wines seem to be favoured.
There are also easy day trips from Madrid to El Escorial, Segovia with its Roman aqueduct, Avila with its 11th century city walls, the cathedral in Toledo. For more royal experience, a 40-minute train goes to the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. Even a visit to the Mediterranean is possible with a 2-hour high speed train that takes you from Atocha station to Valencia.
So, do you choose Madrid with its capital city vibe, royal palace, history, geographic accessibility, excellent restaurants from tapa bars to fine dining, world famous museums such as the Prado and the Thyssen, small museums such as the Sorollo?
Or do you choose Barcelona with its waterfront and beach, Catalonian language, history, food and pride, and the humility and magnificence of Gaudi?
Confident and sophisticated Madrid or fun and fanciful Barcelona? With just a train ride separating them, choose both!

before things get weird, and you wonder why I never mention this world-class city.
I have lived just outside the magestical metropolis of Barcelona for almost six years. I've dragged my husband to see most of the important works of art and architecture and taken my little art-enthusiast son on adventures to museums and shops, cafes, and kids' activities. It's a wonderful city filled with inspiration and mystery, bohemia and affluence.
As well my little family and I have traveled all around the Barcelona region, from days by the Mediterranean sea to skiing in the Pyrenees. Delightful vegan cafes to classy restos which promise vegan or vegetarian options. I've posted photos and maybe some videos on Instagram but never written a proper blog post.
A vegan meat and potatoes post about all my insights and perspectives, notions, and musings of my adopted home. I don't know why that is. To be honest, I could probably JUST write about the Barcelona region for the rest of my blogging days and do quite well. But for some reason, I don't.
I guess that happens. When you live in a world-class city, you eventually take it for granted.
So, it's 2023, and I'm going to start the year off right with a quick and snappy post about Barcelona…here goes.
Barcelona is a wonderful place to visit any time of year. Although, if you are more of an art, shopping, and dining tourist, I highly recommend the winter months. Nice weather without sweltering heat and smaller lineups to all of the beautiful sites to see.
Architect Antoni Gaudí's life work really is unlike anything you will ever see anywhere else. Park Güell, Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, and La Pedrera-Casa Milà are just some of the many whimsical buildings that this true patriot of Catalonia created. I say true patriot as Gaudí was a fierce supporter and defender of Catalan culture and language no matter how much trouble it caused him.
Barcelona is for everyone. Although Friday and Saturday nights can be a party, it is a great city for most kinds of travelers. Live large in luxury or stay at a backpackers. This city is a buzzing hotspot of activities for all ages. And if you have kids and stay for an extended amount of time, you will delight in all the activities and classes they have for little ones. I can't think of a better place to raise a small child, with all the festivals and parades, gargoyles, and dragons.
Barcelona is so multilingual. Of course, you will hear Catalan and Spanish the most, but on a busy day in the city center, you will hear almost as much French, Italian, German, you name it.
Barcelona has an amazing airport. Easy to get to from the city center- Plaça de Catalunya — Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport is a hub connecting you to pretty much anywhere you want to go…or at least to another airport that will take you anywhere you want to go, like Frankfurt, Paris, etc.
Sometimes, I yearn for the south more than my Andalusian husband ever has. I plead with him that we need to move to Seville and start our lives anew, leave all this chaos behind, and set our sights on one of the world's most important historical cities…but then he reminds me of the airport, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean sea and I calm down for a while.
So, in a nutshell, I truly adore my new home. I feel honored and amazed that I get to live here. I'm so Canadian and monolingual that I sometimes giggle nervously in shock as I hear my small son chattering on in Spanish or translate Catalan into English for my benefit.
I'm forever grateful for that trip I took in 2015 to Barcelona that made me want to come back and stay just long enough to feel what it would be like to live here. And on my second trip in 2016, I met a man from Seville who lived in Barcelona and would one day become mi marido.
So if I never mention Barcelona again, know it's because I'm busy thinking about other things, not because I'm not smitten.

Barcelona is truly the city that has it all. Firstly, one must emphasize the culinary culture, which, in my opinion, is out of this world — and at a price that would leave most Danes astonished. But the city’s architecture is also of a caliber you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Moreover, the southern atmosphere combined with the warmth is always something not to be underestimated. If you’re torn between a city break and a trip to the warmth of the south — well, Barcelona is the city that encompasses both.
The Most Important Meal of the Day
I’m, of course, talking about breakfast. In my case, it often consists of a croissant and a cup of coffee — and fortunately, Barcelona caters quite well to my preferences.
Where Barcelona and I differ is the time of day to have the first meal. I prefer it a bit earlier than the norm in Barcelona. Most cafes here open around noon, but if, like me, you want to make the most of the day, I have a couple of lovely places for you to consider.
Authentic, local, and great value for money.
And they open at 7:30 as of now — a fantastic way to observe the city slowly waking up.
During the warm periods of the year, Bar Cervantes also offers outdoor seating in the sun.
They serve a robust cup of coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice, which can be enjoyed with a croissant or a larger English breakfast if you need to fuel up for the day’s adventures.
The staff is hospitable, friendly, and loud in the right southern way. Most guests are locals, giving the place a cozy and homely atmosphere.
Gimmicky but cozy.
If you’re into second breakfast, or if you’re a snoozer in the morning — here’s a place that opens a bit later (9:30) and offers a more unusual breakfast. El Flako is a breakfast bar that primarily offers cereals and good coffee.
It might seem like a well-executed gimmick, but the place has upheld its standard since 2017. Unless you show up before 10, the likelihood of queues and a full restaurant is quite high. El Flako is well-frequented, with both tourists and locals in the small café with fewer than 20 seats.
The food is at a relatively high level, especially considering the focus on breakfast products. El Flako has over 200 different cereals, 80 different toppings, and 20 different types of milk. And they are happy to recommend what pairs best.
A lovely breakfast in peace.
Another breakfast place to visit in Barcelona is En Aparte. So, if you’ve had enough at El Flako and Cervantes, save this place in the El Born area for another day.
En Aparte is calm despite its location directly on a square. There’s some activity, but not compared to many other places in Barcelona. En Aparte is a French bistro bar, and it certainly lives up to the French kitchen. Most of the ingredients are imported from France, providing ample opportunity for French cheeses and sausages. It may seem like blasphemy to eat such French food in the midst of Barcelona, but occasionally, a bit of variation is needed.
Midday in Barcelona
Barcelona is a very open and inclusive city, so simply strolling around in different areas is a perfect way to spend your day. Every time you pass a small charcuterie, there’s an opportunity to taste some cheese, ham, and sausages, often in small cones at a favorable price. But if you need some inspiration, here are a few landmarks to aim for.
When everyone else recommends tourist traps, let’s go a different way.
Barcelona has many beautiful and interesting tourist attractions — I certainly don’t underestimate that. I am overwhelmed by Gaudi’s architecture, especially La Sagrada Familia, which is, of course, a must-see — but sometimes, you have to take different paths.
Barcelona is a city where those different paths can lead to almost as overwhelming experiences as Gaudi’s masterpieces. If you like graphic design and art, there are good opportunities to visit a few shops and galleries where you can also get a little souvenir to take home.
A couple of suggestions for your art or graphic design hunt could be Heyshop and Micelanea, which are not far from each other. And if you’re in the El Born area, you don’t need guidance from here, as there are galleries around every street corner.
The Gem of Barcelona
La Boqueria literally has everything you dream a Spanish market can offer. And the best part is, you can taste the whole palette since the prices are not particularly high. It generally seems like there’s an understanding that visitors want to try a bit of everything.
The market is open Monday to Saturday from early morning (7 am) and doesn’t close until 5 pm — but remember that siesta might occur midday.
While you’re at La Boqueria, I can only recommend trying Jamón Ibérico Bellota, which is one of the best cured hams on the market. It is made from the ham of black-footed pigs. The pigs roam over much more square footage than usual and are allowed to eat acorns in the last half-year before slaughter. The ham is air-dried for up to 3 years before it hits the market. There are several places in Barcelona where you can find Jamón Ibérico Bellota, but at La Boqueria, it’s hard to miss.
Perfect for the first lunch in Barcelona.
A short walk from the market is likely needed after all those snacks, and you may need a place to rest your legs while enjoying some lunch bites and a nice cortado.
I can only recommend stopping by Sucursal. The atmosphere in the area is very relaxed, and locals often hang out in the small square in front of the restaurant. Order a round of Catalan bravas and finish with a cortado before you hit the road again.
A trendy place with super tasty drinks and food.
The place is incredibly cozy and filled with young creative people. It’s a good place to naturally strike up a conversation with others while trying different items from the menu.
Two Schmucks specializes in delicious drinks, and the waiter is happy to have a drink with you if it’s not too busy. The prices are low, especially considering the quite high level.
Two Schmucks also has a couple of sisters in the city, namely Lucky Schmucks and the original Two Schmucks. Two Schmucks on a Terrace is just the coziest place in the middle of the day, especially if the weather allows for outdoor seating.
Late Evening Hours in Barcelona
In Barcelona, people dine late. Locals typically don’t hit the restaurants until around 9 pm, so in Spain, drinks and dinner can easily go hand in hand — as people usually don’t leave the table until midnight. So, while you wait to go out for dinner, find a place where you can sit and sip on a bottle of wine or a pitcher of Sangria. Here are a couple of good suggestions for where to dine in Barcelona. They are generally on the pricier side, especially for locals
Note: Even if you’re not visiting during the peak season, it’s generally a good idea to make a reservation. At least that’s my experience, especially at the three places I recommend here.
Perhaps the Best Meal in Barcelona
Mediterranean cuisine in well-designed surroundings.The food at Tragaluz is among the most delicious I have ever been served. I can only recommend that everyone traveling to Barcelona spend an evening there. Especially the starters are exciting, as they lean towards the more ‘experimental’ side. The main courses and especially the desserts are a bit more classic. Good craftsmanship and delightful food. It’s as simple as that.
Tragaluz is Italian-inspired with a clear Spanish touch. You rarely get such good Italian food outside of Italy. It’s located close to La Rambla (unfortunately), but in a very nice and cozy side street. The surroundings and atmosphere in the restaurant are, as the subtitle suggests, very beautiful and architectural. There is a pleasant touch of warmth and coziness — but there’s no doubt that it’s a relatively exclusive place.
An Institution in Barcelona
Traditional Catalan institution with good food!Els Quatre Gats has been in Barcelona for many years (since 1897), and even people who have no connection to Barcelona know the place. The place has a long history — in fact, there’s a Wikipedia page just about it.
Throughout its many viable years, Els Quatre Gats has served as a cabaret, a hotel, and, not least, a café/restaurant. Frequented by great artists such as Pablo Picasso.
If only the walls could talk, then I would have even more exciting things to say about this place. But I can’t say anything bad about Els Quatre Gats, except that their beef tartare is too large.
The restaurant is buzzing with life, and it is usually well-filled on most days on both floors. The acoustics are not too great, but that’s compensated for by some live music from a brilliant pianist. At least when I was there.
The food is rustic Spanish but with hints from the French kitchen. They have, for example, a Crema Catalana that is strongly inspired by the classic French Crème brûlée.
The price is, for a local, probably in the expensive league, but with a Danish income, it’s hard to grasp how much and how good food you can get at such a legendary place for relatively few coins.
High recommendation from me, but again: remember to make a reservation.
Food for Everyone
An exclusive food court with something for every taste, in the middle of Barcelona. Last but not least, a place that includes several restaurants.
Four different restaurants and four different bars, in very beautiful surroundings — definitely worth an Instagram picture.
The restaurants each have their own theme, but they all share the Spanish cuisine.
La Braseria: Various meat cuts, prepared on a charcoal grill and in true brasserie style.
La Llotja: Classic fish restaurant with baked, grilled, and steamed fish dishes.
La Taperia: Here, you get Malaga-style rice and noodle dishes, as well as cold and hot tapas, and perhaps Barcelona’s best Paella.
La Parada: Appetizers, pastries, and generally light dishes.
The four bars are no exception when it comes to credibility towards the Spanish cuisine.
Beer & Preserves Bar: A beer bar with local craft beers, but also with the opportunity to taste some delights from, among others, Portugal and France.
Wine & Cured Meats Bar: A wine bar with many good options for purchasing cheese and ham.
Oyster Bar: As the name suggests, we have an oyster bar here, which, in addition to oysters, also offers a good glass of cava.
Cocktail Bar: A cocktail bar with a wide range of good cocktails accompanied by, of course… tapas.
Drinks and New Friends
The right clientele in Barcelona. A final small bonus to an otherwise long text about Barcelona, namely Catalina Café.
The café operates as… well, a café during the daytime, but when the darkness falls, it’s one of those places filled with people from the slightly more creative segment — and are there cozier people to strike up a conversation with over a beer or a pitcher of sangria? My memory is starting to fail me a bit when I try to recall how the experience at Catalina Café was — but I see that as a good sign.
The fun part is, no matter how late you arrive, there are still guests inside the restaurant eating, all while all the chairs, tables, and the nearby green area are completely filled.

In case you missed it, Barcelona have signed a lot of players.
Xavi Hernández has a whole new toy box — and while that’s exciting, finding the balance in his starting XI might be akin to solving a Rubik’s cube. Move any one piece, and you realise several others have to move with it.
This is particularly an issue in the back line. Traditionally, the most stable and unalterable part of the team. “You don’t mess with your centre back partnership”, I hear echoed through the eons of football clichés. And if Xavi is to go along with it, finding the right partnership early is of critical importance.
Today I’d like to play God (or rather, football manager) and work through the options Xavi has at his disposal.
We’ll discuss what is required from a CB in Xavi’s system, take a look at each profile, and knit together a winning combination.
This is a long read, so I’ve split it into chapters. Feel free to pick it up and come back to it.
Alright, let’s get started.
On the ball, Xavi’s centre backs have a varied level of responsibility depending on the game phase.
In general build up, when Barca have established possession, the centre backs are integral to ball progression. That’s because they have more time on the ball than anyone else.
Take the example below, against Real Madrid’s mid-block. The centre backs remain narrow, often supported by a full back (Alba), with the defensive midfielder ahead of them.
Madrid are doing what most organised teams will do: 1) man-mark the defensive midfielder and 2) block the passing lanes to the attacking midfielders.
This is a problem that needs solving. The centre backs need to be smart and technical enough to do so. They usually have three options:
The more of these options the CB can execute consistently, the more valuable they are on the ball. If they have a supreme passing range, and can also drive forward with the ball, they tick all the boxes.
Later we’ll look at the data to help us choose our ideal candidate.
Under pressure
The second scenario that Barca centre backs face is heavy opposition pressure. However, Xavi’s team has a tendency to be pragmatic in these situations, looking for a way out as early as possible.
This means the centre backs don’t have as much responsibility as you might expect.
Usually, they will either go backwards to goalkeeper Ter Stegen — who then is tasked with a progressive pass — or sideways to the full backs. The centre backs don’t tend to take risks.
At most, the centre back will be asked to play a diagonal pass, often to the full back. Which is why, if we’re ranking offensive attributes, passing range is the most important.
Calmness is also necessary, of course. Plus the ability to identify and execute these passes quickly.
Now, on to actual defending.
To be blunt, Xavi’s system is extremely demanding on its centre backs. Not only are we looking for an excellent technical profile, but defenders who can manoeuvre in high-risk situations. Xavi’s Barca commit players forward very aggressively, often leaving the centre backs with a lot of space to cover. Especially if the opponent goes direct.
In this example, eight players are caught ahead of the ball, and Ronald Araújo is burdened with a huge responsibility.
It’s not infrequent to see Barca centre backs isolated like this. Here, the decision whether to press aggressively, or slow the opponent down, is of utmost importance. Making the right call, and executing it decisively, is a huge part of the job.
So the next thing we’re looking for is a proficiency in 1 vs 1 duels. An imposing, athletic profile, capable of either winning the ball outright or (just as useful), slowing the opponent down until the midfielders get back.
Statistically, we can look at aerial duels won %, tackle %, fouls committed, and how often a player gets dribbled past to help find our man.
But wait, there’s more.
On top of this, we’re also looking for the best possible ‘traditional’ centre backs. Those that make important defensive actions inside the box, and nulify the opposition at critical moments.
These players are harder to find using raw data, because their decisions require context to understand. However, we will look at some clips to give us an idea at which defenders excel at this.
Ok, let’s summarise what we’re looking for in our ideal centre back. In a rough order of preference:
With all this in mind, it’s about time to look at our centre back choices, and try to find the right balance and partnership.
Age: 23
At 6'1"" and built like a heavyweight boxer, the Uruguyan behemoth is a unique and important profile in Barca’s squad.
He is clearly Barca’s most aggressive, physical and fastest defender. He wins the most aerial duels (73.5%), has the highest tackle success rate (76.7%) and gets dribbled past only 0.28 times per 90, less than anyone except Gerard Piqué.
In other words, he’s outstanding 1 vs 1, and a rugged ball winner who’s not afraid to engage far from his own box. He’s also a major threat from set pieces.
Sounds pretty good, right?
He has, however, shown some lapses of judgement when defending his own area. Often as a result of over-exuberance. Whether it’s abandoning his position, or getting too tight and committing a foul, he can — at times — lack the calmness that typifies the world’s best centre backs.
But Araújo’s bigger weakness is his on-the-ball prowess. While his pass completion number are good, he is often slow to identify the right option. He can be guilty of dwelling on the ball until the passing lane is blocked.
On top of that, he makes more mistakes on the ball and is dispossessed more often than any of the current Barca centre backs (Koundé has more errors, but we’ll talk about him later). This is highlighted most when Araújo is put under pressure.
He is, however, quite effective at carrying the ball forward. His speed and strength make him difficult to dispossess, and he’s brave enough to take responsibility.
All-in-all, we’re looking at a brute of a defender who, while not dreadful in possession, still needs to work on that aspect of his game.
Strengths: Barca’s premier ball winner, excellent 1v1, athletic and quick, not afraid to carry the ball forward
Weaknesses: Vision and passing range, uncomfortable under pressure
Age: 21
I thought it would be fun to put Eric next, because he’s at the other end of the defensive spectrum.
Without a doubt, Eric García is Barca’s best ball-playing centre back. He averages around 95% pass completion, and is by far the most accurate passer over long distances. He’s also the most proactive passer, identifying options and executing immediately. And to complete his passing profile, he’s deadly accurate with both feet.
He’s also very good at carrying the ball through the lines.
But, as I’m sure you know, this all comes at a cost. If Araújo is Barca’s best ball winner, Eric is by far the worst. He wins the least aerial duels (56.1%), is the least effective tackler (a pitiful 37% success rate), and gets beaten more than anyone else (0.75 times per 90).
It’s clear that Eric uses aggression to make up for his lack of physical stature— and it’s not totally in vain. Only Christensen makes more interceptions than Eric (2.29 per 90). But his aggression is a double edged sword; he commits more fouls than anyone else (1.59 per 90).
To give Eric his due, when he doesn’t have to win 1 vs 1 duels, he’s a reasonably stable defender. His anticipation inside the box is usually good, and he’s 100% committed, always. But at the highest level he can and has been bullied.
He’s young, so he has time to develop physically. And his skillset is so specialised that he’s worth keeping around. But you’d be hard-pressed to trust him when it’s do or die.
Strengths: Supreme passer with both feet, identifies passes quickly, carries the ball effectively, a solid box defender
Weaknesses: Loses duels often, commits a lot of fouls, a very inefficient ball winner
Age: 26
Christensen is a new addition to the squad who has already shown a lot of promise. He sits between Araújo and Eric on the real defender — ball-player spectrum, and I’d go so far as to call him the most balanced centre back in the squad.
Defensively his numbers are stellar. He made the most tackles + interceptions last season (3.13 per 90), while not getting beaten very often (0.30 times per 90), and also making very few fouls (0.78 per 90).
We can infer, then, that he’s a very efficient ball winner. Even his tackle success rate (66.7%) is only eclipsed by Araújo.
He’s less aggressive than the Uruguayan, but an equally effective defender in most scenarios. He wins less aerial duels (only 61.9%), but he’s better suited to defending his own box due to his calmness and positional awareness.
Christensen’s other advantage is a rounded profile in possession. He too is capable of carrying the ball forward. But more importantly, he has excellent vision and passing range. After Eric, he’s the most consistent passer over long distances.
A balanced profile that is certainly in contention for a starting position.
Strengths: A composed ball winner, commits few fouls, good vision and passing range, a great box defender
Weaknesses: Aerial duels, not as fast or athletic than some of his competition
Age: 23
Koundé is a very interesting case, and not just because of the fanfare around his signing.
Of all the centre backs in the squad, Koundé is by far the most forward thinking. He is a willing ball carrier, who is often seen marauding into the opponent’s final third.
This offensive movement has been facilitated by Sevilla’s system. The holding midfielder (usually Fernando) drops between the centre backs in possession, creating a pseudo back three. With Koundé on the right, he has license to break forward and become an offensive threat. And he’s not shy about it.
Positionally, this role is quite comparable to how Barca’s inverted full backs operate. It suits Koundé because it makes the most of his ability to break lines, while also remaining an important defensive presence — particularly in transition.
So lets move onto his defensive ability. He is, undoubtedly, an accomplished defender despite his young age. His combination of anticipation, balance, speed and composure is frightening. Not only is he extremely difficult to beat, he reads the game immaculately, making him a superb defender around his own box.
His anticipation borders on prescience; it’s like he’s moving before the ball is played.
In terms of underlying data, he’s most comparable to Christensen. He is dribbled past only 0.33 times per 90 and commits fewer fouls than anyone else (0.72 per 90). His tackle success rate (63%) is middle of the road, as are his aerial duels (64.5% won), but he has an advantage when it comes to speed and athleticism.
You can see why there’s so much excitement around this signing.
Strengths: Excellent 1 vs 1, fast and athletic, great anticipation and composure inside his own box, attacking mentality and high-impact ball carrier
Weaknesses: Lowest pass completion over long distances (73.8%)
Age: 35
Ah, Piqué. A club legend who, even up until last season, was Barcelona’s most important defender. At least, that’s what the data suggests.
When Piqué was on the pitch, Barcelona’s xG difference increased by +0.77 per game, compared to when he wasn’t playing. That’s the biggest impact of any defender last season.
Of course, stats like these need context. Piqué profited from being fit during Barca’s most successful spell of the season. Truth be told, his level has dropped, injuries have blighted him, and physically he sometimes struggles to keep up.
That’s why last season he went to ground more often, and committed more fouls than ever before (1.47 per 90).
However, his defensive numbers are still very adequate. Last season he was second only to Araújo in aerial duels (67.4% won). He was dribbled past less often than anyone (0.22 per 90). He also made the most recoveries (11.8 per 90).
However (spoiler alert) he’s not in my first choice back line.
On the evidence of pre-season, his physical condition is deteriorating considerably. If he can’t be counted on for the vast majority of the campaign, it makes little sense to give him minutes over the other options.
His experience will be useful, as will his leadership. But there’s enough quality in the squad now to warrant phasing him out of the team. And at 35, there’s no shame in that.
Ok, we’ve finally made it. I think this calls for a drum role…
If I were Xavi, my first choice back four would be:
I know, this might come as a surprise. In fact, I’m going against 80% of fans who voted on my Twitter poll. But let me explain.
Christensen — Araújo — Koundé is unbreakable
This is, admittedly, a defence-first selection. By sacrificing a ‘real’ right back I’m taking away an important offensive weapon, right?
Well, not exactly.
As I explained earlier, Barca commit a lot of players forward. At the very least, it’s the front three, plus both attacking midfielders. Sometimes Jordi Alba joins in too. Purely for the sake of balance, I want the remaining players to be defensively imperious. These three — Koundé, Araújo and Christensen — are exactly that.
This decision is made easier by the fact that Xavi’s right back is often inverted. Working in the right half-space, it’s important for the right back to be comfortable on the ball, carry a threat from a deep position, and manage transitions effectively.
Here’s why I think Koundé fits the bill perfectly:
Why Koundé at right back?
Knowing that I want these three in the starting lineup, the question is who’s being ‘sacrificed’ at right back. I’ve gone with Jules Koundé.
The obvious answer is Araújo, but on the evidence I’ve seen, he’s simply not comfortable enough receiving on the touchline or under pressure. Meanwhile, as we’ve seen, Koundé’s role at Sevilla is surprisingly similar to an inverted right back.
For example, he can comfortably receive and progress from the right touchline:
He can drive forward and break lines in the right half-space, which is an incredibly valuable weapon against well-organsied mid blocks:
He can find runners from the right half-space:
He can comfortably snuff out counter-attacks:
And he can defend 1 vs 1 against the world’s best wingers:
It’s unfortunate that, at right back, you might lose his fantastic positional awareness in the box. But for my money it’s a risk worth taking to get both Araújo and Christensen in the starting XI.
Why Christensen at left centre back?
I think Christensen is a fantastic defender. He was a staple in Chelsea’s Champions League winning team, and he’s shown already he can adapt to Barca’s system.
He’s at left centre back specifically for two reasons. 1) I want Araújo on his more comfortable side, because he’s less composed under pressure. 2) Christensen is better equipped to deliver the left-to-right diagonal ball into the right winger.
Barca create a lot of overloads on the left, with the intention of switching the ball over to the right, where Dembélé (or Raphinha) is 1 vs 1. Christensen will execute this more consistently than Araújo.
What about Eric?
I wouldn’t be surprised if Eric García gets decent game time this season. Against teams that provide little attacking threat, perhaps. Equally, I can see him wasting away on the bench.
His performances in pre-season have been excellent. His profile is unique and Barca are certainly more devastating offensively when he’s playing. But at the highest level, the reward isn’t worth the risk.
He has time, though. He’s only 21.
And finally…Piqué?
You might have noticed that Piqué is the only centre back over the age of 26. That’s not ideal. His level might have dropped, but from a squad-dynamics perspective, he’s a useful asset.
I think Piqué will get some game time this year, perhaps to protect a player on a yellow card, or in a rotational situation. But in terms of development, it’s far more important to prioritise every other player on this list.
So there we have it. No doubt plenty of you will have something to say about my selections and reasoning, so I’m continuing the discussion over on Twitter. I hope to see you there.
FINALLY — this is one of the more extensive pieces I’ve put together. If you enjoyed, please do ‘clap’, it helps immensely. And, as always, follow the page for more in-depth Barcelona content.
Until next time!

7 Reasons why FC Barcelona has fallen so low
FC Barcelona frustrated me for a long period of time. They have beaten teams I supported far too often. Now, the situation is quite the opposite, which brought many smiles to my face. However, I didn’t wish them to fall so far of a cliff.
The Catalans were knocked out of a Champions League. In Spanish Primera Divison they are nowhere near the title race. Things that were seasons or months ago self-evident are nowadays anything but that. Let us look at 7 reasons why this is the case.
Everything starts and ends with money. Unfortunately. Due to COVID-19, the club’s income rapidly fell. Because of that players at some point lowered their wages up to 70%. A case where Gerard Piqué had to lower his earnings to the point that newcomers could join the club before the season (Sergio Agüero, Memphis Depay …) was bizarre. With the ability to earn more in clubs that are perhaps nowhere near the rename of Barcelona, footballing superstars are far from being the biggest fans of joining the Spanish giant. Earning more in an environment with less pressure is far more tempting right?
2. Inability to keep Lionel Messi
Related to point 1. was an inability to keep Lionel Messi. The greatest footballer that ever was, didn’t receive permission from the Spanish La Liga delegates that he could play for free (Barca no longer afforded him due to enormous debt). Therefore, he moved to PSG and the club was left without a player that won them trophies and football matches over and over again. Sometimes even simultaneously. It’s true that lately, he stuck his nose in something that he should not have (more on that later), but since decision-makers decided to tolerate it, his departure was a massive blow.
3. Catastrophic recruitment
Since Neymar left, everything went from bad to worse in a transfer market for “Mes que un Club”. The pressure to add a deadly quality to the duo Suarez-Messi (later only Messi) was enormous. And it failed on every single occasion. Barca has spent hundreds of millions of pounds for the likes of Ousmane Dembélé, Philippe Coutinho, and Antoine Griezmann. If anyone justified their gigantic transfer fees then we should all stop watching this beautiful sport right away. It’s as simple as that. Dembélé was struggling with injuries most of the time, Griezmann was with his head still in Atletico Madrid and Barca’s fan opinions stressed in public made Coutinho forget how to properly play football.
4. Inability to stabilize the team’s core
It would be totally unfair if we have criticized only the above-mentioned players. Arda Turan, Samuel Umtiti, Miralem Pjanić, Martin Braithwaite, Andre Gomes, etc. were all high-profile players. Players that would stabilize the team and bring what is required of them. Instead, these mid-size signings if you like, also failed in the long term. The team was extremely far away from the season 2008/2009 when you can name practically the same starting 11 at 3 AM all year long.
5. Lionel Messi
We covered that, right? Nope. We are just getting started. Despite all the unique masterclass, the Argentinian overstepped his authorization far too many times. By giving ultimates to the club president who should they buy and sack, which became publicly known, he tried to position himself as the biggest authority there is. Even bigger than a club itself. Something like a one-man band. Remember, no player is greater than the club. Just ask David Backham’s rubbed face when it was hit by the football booth thrown by Sir Alex Ferguson when the England international tried to do the same. In this case, Josep Maria Bartomeu didn’t have a plan for how to deal with “bossing” Messi. It seemed that he opted for a middle ground by fulfilling and on the other hand rejecting some of his wishes. However you put it, the full extent of such bad influence is seen now. The recruitment process should be dealt with by the people responsible for that. Furthermore, Messi’s lack of defensive engagement only worsened the whole situation on the pitch. Walking on the field after they were losing became a begging to an end of once a brilliant all eleven team effort. And when everyone is not committed 100%, poor results follow, especially on important matches.
6. Shaken European mindset.
After squandering a big advantage against A. S. Roma, uncertainty began to flood through the veins of Barcelona’s players when it came to Champions League matches. After repeating the same against Liverpool a year later, a winning mentality changed immediately. Catastrophes against Bayern Munich and PSG seasons later were written all over. Hmmm. Let me correct myself. Everything even escalated by not reaching the competition’s knock-out phase this year.
7. Sacking Ernesto Valverde
Being first on a La Liga table doesn’t guarantee you keeping a managerial position. Total madness. Before that, Valverde also brought 4 trophies to the club. After sitting top of the table, he was sacked because of … whatever strange reasons you believe. Since his departure “Mes que un Club’s” strength only worsened.
There you have it. If you think, I have missed any, just let me know in the comments below. I’d be happy to agree or disagree.

When we began planning to relocate to Portugal in 2022, I was excited for the opportunity to ditch my car and use public transit — especially trains — to get around.
And for the most part that's what we've done: we don't own a car, and we get around the center of Lisbon by public transit, with the occasional bit of frustration when a bus arrives late or a metro carriage is packed to the brim with commuters.
Comboio Portugal's trains can get you around most of Portugal without too much difficulty, but we were disappointed to discover that there were no easy routes out of Portugal and into Spain — much less into the greater continental system of trains that crisscross Europe.
But what do I mean by an ""easy route?""
The main issue is that — due to a limited number of train schedules — it is not possible to travel from one end of the peninsula to the other without an overnight stay somewhere near the middle. The limited number of departures — and indeed the speed of the route itself — mean that it's not possible to do even if you catch the first train out of Lisbon or Barcelona early in the morning.
Badajoz is a Spanish city in the ancient and contested border region of Extremadura (Estremoz in Portuguese). It’s a medium-sized city that seems to be well-accommodated, with historical relevance dating back to pre-Roman times.
But key to our attention is the fact that Badajoz is the current nexus of Portugal's train service, Comboio Portugal, and Spain's primary rail carrier, Renfe. Here the two services join at a small but functional station.
But your problems originating from Lisbon actually begin before you reach Badajoz, at a small city in Santarém called Entroncamento.
Entroncamento is where the relatively-fast Intercidades train service from Lisboa Oriente switches to the slow, frequently-stopping Regional service from Comboio Portugal. There are no direct trains from Lisbon to Badajoz, and you must switch at Entroncamento, with the same being true going the other direction.
The Regional service from Entroncamento is on a small, two-carriage train that makes 16 stops along the way and takes almost 3 hours to make the journey between Entroncamento and Badajoz. It's not entirely uncomfortable, but it is not fast, and the stops are frequent. But they are also some of the most charming stops along the route, and they offer some of the most beautiful vistas of Portugal's interior.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is likewise beautiful. It's accomplished on Renfe's Alvia service, and is much more comfortable than the journey between Badajoz and Entroncamento. The Alvia has comfortable, assigned seats, air conditioning, and a cafeteria car. It's much more like the Comboio Portugal Intercidades service, and it offers gorgeous views of Spain's snow-capped Sierra de Gredos mountains.
Gazing out the window of either the Renfe or CP trains, it's easy to imagine the Iberian countryside of Hemingway's cock and bull stories — gentle brooks that wind past the ruins of old stone fences, among low-slung green hills dotted with the outlines of black bulls and cork trees. This scene blends uninterrupted on either side of the border for a 100km stretch, making it impossible to know which country you're in.
On the Portuguese side of the line, I saw a farmer with a plow yoked to a mule, manually plowing the soil with equipment that Iberian farmers have used for a thousand years. I could barely believe my eyes.
Our goal is to reach Barcelona, and we don't mind leaving on the earliest train out of Lisboa Oriente. And in all of our scenarios we will select the fastest services available.
That will be the 07:39 AM Intercidades (IC) departing from Lisboa's Oriente station. Oriente is a lovely station that's easy to navigate and can be reached from the Lisbon Metro's red line. The IC ride from Oriente to Entroncamento is the shortest leg of the entire journey, clocking in at a little under an hour and placing you there by 08:30 AM assuming everything goes right (it often does not on Comboio Portugal).
Here you have a few moments to top off snacks and water and locate your train to Badajoz. The Entroncamento station is pretty spartan and has limited facilities, so it's really best to get anything you'll need for the entire stretch to Badajoz before you leave Oriente.
In Entroncamento, you switch trains onto the slow-rolling and frequently-stopping Regional service departing at 09:06 AM. This train has two cars and unassigned bench seating. It's far from comfortable and at 3 hours it can be a test of patience.
By the time you roll into Badajoz at 12:54 PM you will have lost an hour crossing the Spanish border.
You will also need to find some way to occupy several hours, as the next train departing for Madrid is at 05:43 PM on Renfe's Alvia service.
Here is where a key decision emerges on your trip from Lisbon to Barcelona — spend a long evening and night in Badajoz, waking the next morning to catch the first train to Madrid at 08:16 AM, or continue on to Madrid, arriving at 10:39 PM, where you will spend the night and have many options for reaching Barcelona the following day. Your choice basically comes down to: where would I rather sleep?
The good news, I suppose, is that 10:39 PM is a perfectly acceptable time to find a meal in Spain, where dinners often do not begin until 9:00 PM or later. But if you are already tired, Badajoz seems to have plenty to offer and — at least as far as I can tell — would not be a bad place to spend the night. And spending the night here would certainly allow you to eventually roll into Barcelona a little earlier in the day.
The leg from Badajoz to Madrid is a little under 5 hours whether you take the 08:16 AM or the 05:43 PM, but it is comfortable, with the Alvia offering assigned seats and both 1st and 2nd class carriages. There is a well-equipped cafeteria car and frequent trips up and down the aisles by the food cart.
Assuming that you decided to spend the night in Badajoz and take the 08:16 AM Alvia the following morning, you would arrive in Madrid a little past noon, and would then have many options for traveling on to Barcelona. All of them can be on Renfe's AVE high speed rail service, which was slightly nicer than the Alvia service and comparable to Comboio Portugal's Alfa Pendular high speed service.
This is the route I actually took a few weeks back. It was long — and I made the trip hung over from a night of drinking with colleagues in Barcelona — but it got me home.
As with the trip originating in Lisbon, we want to get as far as possible in a given day, so we don't mind leaving early. During my trip a few weeks ago, I intentionally chose a later train as I knew the earliest train out — at 5:50 AM — would be too early for me, and as we'll see in a moment, sacrificing sleep to get out as early as possible is not going to do anything for getting home faster when going west.
The AVE service is nice and fast, with comfortable seats that you can select in first and second class. I bought a first class seat because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible with a belly full of last night's cocktails — not that it helped much as the train jostled from side-to-side as it chugged slowly out of the ancient Catalonian principality.
The countryside here looks a lot different than it does coming from the west, but during this time of the year it was beautiful. Fruit orchards (I couldn't tell if they were cherries, plums, peaches, or some other variety of stone fruit blossoms) were in full bloom, creating rows of pink and white blossoms that striped the countryside all the way to Madrid.
The AVE service should drop you in Madrid at a very respectable 9:10 AM. But the problem is that on most days, there are only two trains departing Madrid for Badajoz: 8:30 AM and 4:17PM. And you've already missed one of them.
So you must again ask yourself where you'd prefer to spend the night.
Even though it feels like you haven't made it very far, there's a strong case to be made for spending an evening in Madrid vs. Badajoz. Madrid is a major city with many restaurants and attractions that can be used to blow your time. It's almost worth it just to exit the train station here so you can see the beautiful edificio of Madrid's Puerta de Atocha railway station. But there are also museums, parks, the botanical gardens, and more just a short distance from the station.
I chose to spend the night in Madrid and got a small room near the train station so that I could pull out on the first train to Badajoz the next morning. Given the hangover, I did not do any sightseeing. But you're smarter than me and won't have that particular problem. Right? I did eat some of the worst croquettes I've ever had that night.
Sorry Spain — Portugal's are just better.
That first train leaves at 8:30 AM, and at least for me, navigating the train station was a little confusing, so I suggest leaving yourself enough time to figure out how to get to the right train. The arrival and departure terminals are in separate buildings, so make sure you go to the right one.
The Alvia train to Badajoz is fine, with all of the amenities you need to be comfortable, but with slightly less-comfortable seats than the AVE even in first class. It speeds along just south of Spain's Sierra de Gredos mountains. With their snow-capped peaks, they make for a gorgeous backdrop to the aforementioned cow pastures and cork trees. It's a little like Texas hill country, but with some very serious hills.
By the time you reach Badajoz at 1:34 PM in the afternoon you will have made a 5 hour haul across the Iberian peninsula, but it places you in Badajoz with enough time to catch the trains on to Lisbon, where you will pick up an hour as you cross the border.
The first train to Portugal departs at 2:09 PM in the afternoon, so you have a bit of time to get snacks and water before moving on. If you miss it, there's another train to Lisboa Oriente station at 7:41 PM, but it obviously puts you in Lisbon much later at night (after 10:00 PM). This may not matter as much for a tourist, but as I was eager to get home to my family, my calculations were always focused on getting home as early in the day as possible.
Both services require taking the slow moving Regional service to Entroncamento — the reverse of what I described in the first westward-bound trip — and switch to an Intercidades service for the final leg of the journey to Lisbon's Oriente Station.
The Regional service to Entroncamento sits on an inconspicuous track that's on the perimeter of the main platforms. It's clearly labeled as a Comboio Portugal train, and when we arrived I assumed it was the train I needed to board. But we were made to enter the terminal anyway, and not permitted to re-enter the platform until its scheduled departure.
The Regional service to Entroncamento also departed late, but the conductor mostly made up the time during the trip. It was interesting to observe the people getting on and off along this route. Many of its stops were extremely rural, and I saw a mixture of different commuters: cyclists fully-decked in their cycling gear who brought bicycles aboard and got off after a few stops, grannies with grocery bags in either hands who rode the train for just one stop, and younger folks who looked like they were taking the full ride for a weekend of partying in Lisbon. Sometimes the conductor stepped out to help the older passengers on or off the train with their grocery bags or boxes, and it was easy to imagine that this cast of regulars were people he knew well and saw multiple times a week.
We arrived about 10 minutes late and discovered that CP had held the outbound train to Lisbon, allowing us to board and make the 4:52 PM arrival time in Lisbon.
This was much to the current passengers' consternation, but much to my relief and gratitude.
While I'm glad I made the cross-peninsular trip by train, it's not something I would want to do regularly. Nor, perhaps, would I want to do it with a large family and lots of luggage in tow.
But if you have a few days to burn and nowhere better to be, and you don't mind a slow moving tour of the Iberian countryside, this is an excellent option.
I should point out that overall the cost of the trip was actually comparable to a round-trip airline ticket. The Portuguese leg of the trip comes out to about €25 one way. The leg between Portugal and Madrid is another €45. And a first class ticket on the AVE between Madrid and Barcelona, in either direction, comes out to about €119. This is all in one direction.
If cost is your limiting factor — and especially travel time — air travel makes more sense.
But there are plenty of good reasons to take the train if you can: reduced environmental impact, the ability to get up and walk around to stretch your legs and take in views, choices for food and drink in the cafeteria cars, and beautiful views of the countryside are all compelling reasons to consider travel-by-train. And while the trains (at least in Spain) require you to run your bags through a screening process, it was nothing compared to the headache that is air travel in the year 2025.
I'd like to see more options for getting places by rail, so I try to take the trains whenever it's feasible. My hope is that the more we use trains, the more countries see the demand for expanded routes and increased optimization in existing routes.
While I might not take this route frequently, I'm at least comfortable in the implications that it brings and can pack and plan accordingly. And if you believe the hype, plans are in the works to bring high speed service between Lisbon and Madrid. If accomplished, this would result in something like 3 hours of travel time between the peninsula's capitals and would make getting on to Barcelona in a day an easy feat.
But I'm afraid the Portuguese cynicism for major works like this has already worn me down, and I'm not expecting this to be the case any time soon.
Even if I don't plan on going from coast to coast, I know I can make it from capital to capital in a single day, and that's a thing I might try to do more often now that I've done it once.
And maybe at some point, I'll make the cross-peninsula trek and just keep going — into France and the heart of Europe. But that's a feat for someone with way more time on their hands than me right now.

On April 28, I was in Barcelona, invited as an entrepreneurship scholar to give a talk at the University of Barcelona’s Business School (Thank you!). I thought it could be fun to have a seminar exploring the remake of business ideas — when it makes sense to repeat or revisit a business or creative concept, and when it’s better to radically innovate. I wanted to talk about how the world of movie remakes could reveal something deeper about entrepreneurship, creative industries, and innovation: that true novelty often doesn’t come from starting over, but from reinterpreting, adapting to new constraints, remixing old material with new needs. I had no idea how quickly the remake metaphor would become real.
Around mid-morning, just as I was about to start my seminar, the lights went out. At first, together with the scholars who had invited me, we thought it was a local glitch. Then the phones lost signal. The Wi-Fi stopped. People started saying this blackout was huge — we were in a state of emergency, the most significant infrastructure collapse in recent European memory. It hit all of Spain, Portugal, and parts of France. The thought that two entire countries had gone offline in broad daylight was deeply unsettling. People around me speculated — was it a cyberattack? Terrorism? Something tied to the war in Ukraine? But no one knew, and the uncertainty lasted until the very end of the outage.
Similar to the Northeast Blackout of 2003 in the Northeast U.S. and the Pakistan blackout of 2023, which impacted about 230 million people, this massive power outage hit a modern, hyper-digital society. Suddenly, there was no electricity. No mobile service. No buses, no metro, no trains. While people couldn’t easily move, I later discovered — sadly — that many had remained stuck in dark elevators. I saw that shop owners didn’t know how to close their stores, since most shutters today are electric. People walking through the streets stopped to help carry the weight of the shutters down, it was heartening to see that spirit.
I had to return to my temporary apartment to check whether the electric card system on the door still worked, I was not sure. It was about six kilometers away. With all transport paralyzed and taxis overwhelmed, I walked. Since traffic lights stopped working, the traffic was a bit erratic. I understood in my bones what system theorists mean when they say infrastructures are “invisible until they break”. Yet, drivers and pedestrians remained gentle with one another, intuitively creating a sense of flow.
At the apartment, the stairwell was completely dark, so I used my phone’s flashlight to see the steps. I was lucky, my apartment door still worked thanks to a battery system. That was a relief, even if I didn’t know how long the battery would last, or why a simple key option wasn’t implemented. Shouldn’t we always have a plan B when we design innovation?
Then, I immediately went to the only supermarket in the area that was still accepting cards. Yes, ATMs stopped working, and I hadn’t planned to use cash, just like thousands of others. Sadly, it felt like the bad old COVID days, with people buying water and toilet paper. Digging through the shelves, I was wondering when the light would come back (spoiler: it fully came back around 2 a.m., waking me up with all sorts of alarms — especially the fridge, which I didn’t even know had one!). I remembered I could buy candles, not just for their scent. But all I found were scented ones, I wondered why it’s so hard to keep products simple. I couldn’t find a lighter either, they were sold out. A young man from Albania handed me one as a gift, a beautiful moment of solidarity emerged. As I read later on Instagram, even Ursula von der Leyen noted that people responded with remarkable cooperation by taking care of one another. I want to echo this and highlight the incredible solidarity shown by the people of Spain during this difficult time.
Back at my apartment, I lit the candles, and I waited for good news. My balcony neighbors asked if I had an electric radio. Unfortunately, I didn’t. So, without TV or any means of communication, they got into their pajamas and went to sleep around 8:30 p.m., not exactly usual for Spain, I thought. The radio felt like a symbol of resilience, something simple, connecting people, low-tech but powerful. The night passed slowly, with no light at all — not even streetlights — until, at midnight, a few apartments lit up again and people started clapping, as if the near-apocalyptic event had passed. Since COVID, we don’t look the same, nor should we. Alertness runs higher now, and we’re deeply grateful when things return to normal.
Those twelve hours without electricity and any real way of knowing what was happening — a bit longer for me, since power returned at 2 a.m. in my apartment — made me realize something important in my field of study: we need to strategically design resilient innovation. We need more leaders and companies that help systems bend without breaking. This time, it happened in Spain and Portugal, but such crises can unfold anywhere in the world. Those hours left me with a few reflections I hope current and future managers or entrepreneurs will consider:
1. When traffic lights stop working, we realize how much we rely on invisible coordination. We often build business systems assuming continuous flow and passive compliance — electricity, broadband, logistics. But when those systems falter, we quickly learn which parts can adapt and self-correct. Organizations should not just scale; they must build resilience by developing structures that anticipate disruption, distribute decision-making, and maintain coherence under stress.
2. Elevators don’t lie: Many systems are not built to fail safely. Some people were trapped in elevators for hours, and that’s more than an inconvenience. Products and services shouldn’t be judged only by their performance under ideal conditions. They must be designed to fail well: to respond with agility and degrade gracefully, rather than collapse entirely.
3. Build trust like infrastructure, it’s one of your most resilient assets. I had to buy candles, but couldn’t light them until someone gave me a flame. At that moment, unexpected help reminded me that human connection is a fundamental offline resource. We talk about trust, community, and networks, but rarely as infrastructure. And yet, in moments of collapse, social capital performs better than hardware. Founders and company managers must build not only code, but networks of reciprocity, empathy, and trust.
4. Jolts reveal the innovation we need next. After the blackout, I noticed a few gaps: no offline modes in apps, elevators without battery backup, and solar panels that couldn’t power basic needs. But I also saw opportunity — local microgrids, edge networks, emergency communications, predictive tools, and emotionally aware crisis design. There’s a real need to stay informed when the internet goes down, and to open doors when the power fails. That means many products must include basic functions that work offline and in emergencies. These needs aren’t niche, they’re urgent.
5. Resilience is not the opposite of innovation, it is the future of innovation. I had planned my seminar around the concept of idea remakes — when and how we should reintroduce an old idea or product to the market. What I saw in Barcelona felt like a remake itself: you don’t always need to start from zero — you can adapt what you already have. Resilient systems are not frozen backups. They are active reimaginings. In a world of jolts, the remake isn’t lazy, it’s smart. Reinventing something today doesn’t just mean improving it. It means making sure it can quickly adapt when the world stops playing by the usual rules.
Hours without electricity and a mobile connection are unsettling, even in a beautiful city like Barcelona, which I hope to visit again soon. If you’ve never tried it, spend just six or seven hours without your phone, Wi-Fi, or smartwatch. Feel the isolation — notice what goes dark, and what unexpectedly lights up. Now that the power is back, I can more clearly see space for entrepreneurs and managers to rethink our approach to innovation.

My study abroad experience has undoubtedly been the most memorable quarter of my time at UW and one of the most transformative experiences in my life so far.
Through my classes, I’ve had the chance to observe the distinct teaching approaches in Spanish education. The country’s remarkable transportation system has allowed me to travel weekly, visiting destinations beyond Barcelona such as Madrid, Tarragona, and Granada. I even had the eye-opening opportunity to spend five days in Morocco with a school group, where I was immersed in a culture vastly different from my own.
The highlight of this journey has been my homestay with a local Spanish family, where I’ve been fully immersed in both the language and culture. Their incredible warmth has made me feel at home, and I feel my Spanish has improved significantly.
This experience has solidified my long-standing interest in a global career, strengthening my desire to pursue a path filled with international opportunities that will continue to fuel my curiosity and passion for cultural exploration.

This is a super‑brief review of my notes and some information from the talks I managed to attend.
Probably, nobody will be surprised by knowing that AI was part of many talks and conversations. I think we are all looking for the tasks and processes we can improve with AI, the ones that do not work well, and we are all curious about the future. But, as you’ll see, there was much more than AI.
Sarah‑Jane Madden reminded us that it’s not the first time we've been told that everything is changing. Through the years, we have had similar situations, and she stressed how important it is for security not to be late and to ensure that all the work we have done to be part of development from the very beginning is not wasted. We should be involved early because if we are not, we’ll go back to the same stage we were in the past, when it was too late to think about security.
Elliot Ward showed how LLMs are still not a good choice to look for vulnerabilities in code, but using an LLM to analyse results from SAST tools was a good option for triaging vulnerabilities. Elliot’s approach used an agent that took results from SARIF and output whether the finding was a false positive or not, and how confident it was about the result. The takeaway was that this helps, but we still get some false positives. Also, as mentioned in the talk, we’re seeing these agents already integrated by vendors in SAST tools.
As a break from LLMs, Aram Hovsepyan explained the Goal‑Question‑Metric framework and how good metrics answer meaningful questions. He analysed a few cases to see what makes a good metric and how it has to be precise, reliable, and valid, and how we are mixing metrics such as vulnerability types, CVSS, and EPSS when we shouldn’t. Last but not least, he showed clear examples of how a metric could lead us to think one way, but then seeing the data represented tells another story.
Rory McCune demonstrated how an attacker with privileged access to K8s will be really difficult to catch and clean. For example, by abusing APIs that are less well‑known and do not have audit logs. An example was how an attacker could use the CSR API to get a valid client certificate that can be used to authenticate against the cluster, and how difficult it was to revoke it. This doubled down on how important it is to keep clusters off the internet, and again, the importance of keeping permissions tight and audit logs enabled.
Javan Rasokat and Rico Komenda showed an LLM application threat model with potential threats such as prompt injection, poisoned data, and more. Then they mapped the defender side, noting that LLM risks are similar to the ones we already know for the web. There is also the shared‑responsibility model (that we know from the cloud), where part of the security is on the company behind the model, but another part is on the developer using it. They stressed the importance of validation both on input and output, and mentioned a cool open‑source firewall
I finished Day 1 with Paul Schwarzenberger’s demo of the OWASP Domain Protect Project. He showed common mistakes that can leave a domain vulnerable to account takeover and how the project can alert on vulnerable domains and even take preventative actions, such as creating resources (s3 bucket, for example) so attackers or bug‑bounty hunters don’t grab them first.
Kate Labunets highlighted the difficulties of collaboration between academia and the corporate world, showing how the ways of working and objectives are different. The takeaway for me was that this collaboration is going to help everyone, but both sides should make changes or adapt for it to work better.
Spyros Gasteratos explained why the way most teams orchestrate tools via dirty scripts doesn’t scale and how important interoperability is (open standards such as SARIF but most importantly OCSF). Short feedback loops are also crucial, otherwise, you’ll detect a tool not working when it’s too late. To help, he presented smithy, a Go tool that helps automate security team frameworks.
The great Tanya Janca delivered an excellent presentation, sharing what can go wrong in security‑champion programmes and offering practical solutions. Her talk showed the many complexities in these programmes and how they need a lot of work to be successful. While the OWASP talk wasn’t recorded, you can watch her NDC {Security} version and view the OWASP slides with the extra research. If you are building or planning to build a Security Champion program, you must read or watch this.
Two great talks overlapped: Rami McCarthy’s “Scale Security Programs with Scorecarding” and Karim El‑Melhaoui & Håkon Sørum’s “Abusing Misconfigurations in CI/CD to Hijack Apps and Clouds.” I’m a HUGE fan of Rami, but CI/CD security was a higher priority for me, so I chose Karim and Håkon. ( I also knew the guys from O3C wouldn’t disappoint, and they didn’t)
They showed that CI/CD pipelines have become a critical yet often overlooked attack surface. Also, how often they have privileged access to a cloud account, and how simple configuration errors can lead to disaster. To illustrate attacker reach from a compromised CI/CD, they presented an open‑source tool that, BloodHound‑style, uses a Neo4j graph to map everything an attacker could access starting from a compromised GitHub repository.
Tal Folkman made me even more paranoid about supply‑chain attacks, demonstrating how a dev testing a malicious model (from Hugging Face) could be compromised or how a trained code‑completion model could add malicious code without the developer noticing (the example showed the payload being added after a lot of spaces and not visible in the IDE).
If I started the conference with Elliot Ward and how AI was helping with SAST triage, I ended with Murat Zhumagali and AI‑driven threat modelling. Using AWS Bedrock models (for privacy reasons), he built a workflow that pulls Jira info and returns a well‑formatted list of threats. It’s super interesting to see how the new models are delivering much better results, even though the accuracy isn’t 100 %, it’s already reaching really good levels.
The conference was super great, but having so many great talks happening at the same time, and not being recorded, was frustrating.

Before we went to Barcelona, we thought that Boulder, Colorado, north of Denver, might be the world’s dog-loving capital. In Boulder, you can take your dog practically everywhere, and people do. They’re in restaurants and grocery stores, running alongside their bike-riding owners, playing in dog parks, and going on walks. According to one website, there are 15,000 dogs in Boulder, and one out of three households has a dog.
Then, after our 10 days there, I had to believe that Barcelona residents had to love dogs more. There were dogs everywhere we went.
Imagine my surprise when I looked on Google to discover that neither Boulder nor Barcelona is the biggest dog-loving city. There are lots of cities with more dogs per capita, including Houston, Seattle, Bern, Budapest, and others, including Paris and Denver. But I have to wonder if this website is truly up-to-date.
Barcelona may not be the biggest dog-loving city listed on Google, still perhaps it’s the city that cleans up after its dogs the best.
Only once in 10 days did we encounter squished dog poop on the sidewalk, unlike in Paris, where you have to watch where you step, even in the nicer neighborhoods…

On Monday, April 28, a power outage disrupted travel and daily life across Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and parts of France and Belgium — grounding planes, halting trains, and leaving hundreds stuck in elevators. This is a first-hand account of what it was like to be in the middle of the outage.
“Everything all right? You seem tense,” my wife remarked from the passenger seat. We were in the car, a roaring Peugeot 3008 with brake calipers screaming to be replaced, driving our six-month-old to his pediatrician appointment across town.
I’m a calm driver — somewhere between your grandpa and a limo chauffeur — except for the occasional curse word. At least normally. Yet yesterday, the streets of Barcelona were unusually jammed even for a Monday. I could feel myself getting more tense by the minute. And, apparently, so could my wife.
“Half the traffic lights aren’t working,” I pointed out. “Oh, sh — “ I slammed on the brakes. “That guy on the left thinks he has the right of way.”
“Must be some kind of power outage.”

What does it look like when the idea of care as a practice that sustains life, communities, and cities is considered in an urban context? How can this idea be used to inform projects and planning interventions? Those were some of the questions we brought with us to Barcelona (Spain) where we have been conducting fieldwork this week. Today, we completed our visit as part our ongoing research into care-informed urban planning. The project titled “Care-Informed Urban Planning: Learnings and Exchange Across Countries and Sectors” aims is to generate insights into how care ethics are operationalised in the context of planning and urban governance in selected cases. The insights, exchanges, and warm welcomes we encountered in Barcelona have left us both intellectually energised.
Barcelona is truly intriguing. It is a city that is not shying away from pioneering projects, programs, and interventions informed by ideas around inclusion, Ethics of Care, and feminism. We learned that the Barcelona City Council has set up the Area for Feminisms and Equality, a department with a commitment to gender equality, has established the Councillor’s Office for Feminism and LGBTI Affairs and set up a Gender Impact Assessment (GIAs) tool used in policymaking processes, particularly in urban planning and budgeting. These initiatives are part of Barcelona’s broader Gender Justice Plan, aiming to work on inequality through proximity and diversity and reflect a broader commitment to feminist municipalism, integrating equality into urban governance and public policy.
During our fieldwork, we aimed to understand and gain a clearer perspective on how considerations about care are integrated into urban governance. We are incredibly grateful for the warm welcome and generous engagement we received from everyone who we spoke with.
Barcelona has a rich and dynamic approach to urban governance, where multiple actors are involved in shaping living environments. Care concerns seem to be informing many activities of urban governance. We had the chance to learn more about a range of innovative interventions that make care visible and actionable within the urban fabric.
These include the time use initiative, climate refuges, the justice-based approach to culture, Vila Veïna, and the city’s superblocks (in Esp. superilles). Most of these initiatives are run at the neighbourhood level, and a common thread across these efforts is the idea that care is not just a private matter confined to the home. Instead, care is increasingly recognised as a collective, social, and spatial issue. It is an issue that belongs in the public domain. And as such, it deserves institutional recognition, public investment, professional expertise, and spaces for diverse voices to be heard, especially those historically underrepresented in traditional planning processes.
We’re leaving Barcelona inspired and full of ideas and reflections. Thank you to all those who shared their time, knowledge, and reflections with us.
With gratitude,Romina & Miriam

Five years ago, I was fortunate to be leading the team within Metaswitch that launched Project Calico, a revolutionary approach to network virtualization. Not long after, we founded Tigera as a stand-alone startup focused on commercializing Calico and addressing the network security challenges introduced by cloud native architectures.
They say one year is seven dog years. There’s probably a similar ratio when it comes to Silicon Valley Startup Years. I certainly feel like I have learned a couple of decades of lessons as founding CEO and more recently VP Business Development at Tigera. How to balance supporting an open source community and building a commercially successful business; recruit a world class executive team; maintain a relentless focus on execution; foster an ecosystem of mutually beneficial partnerships; and ultimately the immense satisfaction in seeing something you incubated from the germ of an idea to a de facto industry standard adopted practically across the board by all the major cloud providers, vendors, and major enterprise users.
So it probably comes as a surprise to many that I would consider leaving Tigera at this point in its journey. The fact is that I have also gained some wisdom over the past few years, such as: family comes first; there are dreams we have which are more important than pursuing a singular company vision; and building a deep executive bench inevitably means no one individual (including any one founder) is as critical to the company as they were in the beginning.
For a long time, my wife, two children and I have lived in Berkeley, California, but wanted to live for an extended period in Europe — Germany specifically, as our children grew up bi-culturally (my wife is German, and our kids attended German school through 8th grade) but have only ever lived in the US. As we realized our eldest would be graduating high school in 2020, if we wanted to undertake any adventure before they left for college, it would have to be now. With Tigera well established but still small enough to have its exec team based in San Francisco and focused on North America, pursuing this dream would mean moving into a very different role — and as I really enjoy the early stages of company building I decided this would be the time to make a move and jump right into the exciting Berlin tech startup scene.
And so, after a couple of trips to Berlin, we have found places at two excellent high schools there, and I am starting the next phase of my career with the amazing team at Kinvolk.
For those who don’t know Kinvolk, they are one of the most kick-ass engineering teams I know in the cloud native software space. They have deep Linux kernel expertise, but also understand the full application runtime stack including Kubernetes, container runtimes, networking, service mesh, visibility, operations, etc., and are world class security gurus to boot. They were the developers who worked with CoreOS on the rkt container runtime, the folks that extended Weave Scope with BPF support, and the security experts who discovered several security issues in Kubernetes and related projects. They have assisted some of the biggest names in the industry with hard-core systems engineering and penetration testing. And they are great community supporters, organizing meetups and conferences including All Systems Go! and Cloud Native Rejekts (debuting this weekend in Barcelona).
In short, if they’re not already, Kinvolk should be on your radar.
I’ll be joining the team with responsibility for business development, and also bringing additional leadership to the Berlin office while Chris Kuehl, the CEO, moves to Boulder, Colorado to establish a US subsidiary. We have some exciting plans, all built around the core principles of pushing the envelope with leading-edge Linux technologies, a uniquely strong focus on security, and embracing community and open source as the only viable way to achieve that objective.
You can see the first steps in this strategy with the announcement of Lokomotive, Kinvolk’s cutting-edge distribution of Kubernetes. Inspired by CoreOS Tectonic, Lokomotive serves both as a great product in its own right as well as a platform for the development of a suite of complementary tools building on the powerful capabilities in latest Linux kernels. And, talking of Linux, Kinvolk is one of the few Kubernetes companies to also maintain its own container-optimized operating system with Flatcar Linux, originally a fork of CoreOS Container Linux but now very much its own thing with a growing and enthusiastic user base.
Watch out for more updates from me and Kinvolk as I get up to speed, and we start to apply the incredible expertise and talent in the team to some of the hardest problems we see customers facing today as they adopt Kubernetes.
See you at KubeCon in Barcelona, and in Berlin after that!

Who is the greatest football team of all time?
Many people would answer this question with the FC Barcelona in 2010/11. During that season, they won the Champions League, the Spanish League and the Spanish Supercopa. It was a truly successful season. However, there were equal or more successful Barcelona sides in the club’s history. It wasn’t about trophies that made this squad special. Instead, their style of play stood out to others.
Pep Guardiola created a position-based team. Every player knew where to position himself in any given scenario. This positioning enabled Barcelona to control the game. They could hold possession for long periods and therefore have stability.
As the coach himself once said: “Stability is the ball. It’s not to defend 40 meters behind or up front, or high pressing or defend deep or long balls, to be stable as a team is the ball” (Guardiola).
Furthermore, their way of using possession was truly fascinating. Barcelona didn’t just have the ball in sake of having the ball. They constantly seeked for superiority to eventually create chances. It was sometimes slower and sometimes faster, but every pass had an intention.
This article aims to find out, why this Barcelona side is often called the greatest of all time. It mostly covers their in-possession phase as that was most special. But don’t get me wrong, their pressing was incredible too. Nevertheless, most people associate this squad with their possession phase. In the end of this article, I’m shortly going to analyse their counterpressing and why it was so strong.
As already mentioned, the positioning of the players was the most important to create this dominance in their possession phase.
“It’s a game of position, not possession!” (Torrent)
Barcelona’s structure created a lot of diagonal passing lanes and a good distribution all over the pitch. This enabled them to have the ball, progress further up and create chances.
On paper, it was a 4–3–3. But in possession, it was very unusual and asymmetric. It is difficult to describe it with numbers, so let’s have a look on each players role.
Let’s start with the back line of four. The centre backs stayed in the centre and the half-spaces. Besides them, the fullbacks positioned themselves asymmetrically. The right back (usually Alves) moved high up the pitch, nearly playing like a winger. On the left (mostly Abidal) usually stayed deeper. He only moved up on a few occasions, which I will mention later.
The central defensive midfielder (usually Busquets) was the anchor in the midfield. He had a less flexible role than the other midfielders higher up. Busquets mostly stayed in the centre in front of the centre backs and would make horizontal movements. Rarely, he moved higher up.
The two 8s, Xavi and Iniesta also positioned themselves asymmetrically to each other. Xavi on the right played deeper, sometimes besides Busquets to control the game. On the left, Iniesta moved higher up in the left half-space.
The wingers (usually Pedro and Villa) also had different roles. The right winger mostly moved into the right half-space to open the wing for Alves. The left winger usually stayed wide, to open the left half-space for Iniesta.
Lastly, the heart of the squad was their striker, Lionel Messi. He played as a false nine, meaning he constantly dopped deep to connect with the midfield. He often had a tendency, to drop in front of Xavi, to make use of the opened space by the deeper positioning of the Spaniard. Although, Messi’s role was more or less free and he could move wherever he wanted to.
The structure mostly remained the same. It was important that the positions/spaces are occupied, not who occupied them. Most of the time, it looked like in the image above. Though, rotations could occur, meaning the structure could vary for a short period. I will go into detail on these rotations later.
Although, sometimes the structure changed slightly for longer periods, but the principles always remained the same. One change in the structure was e.g., both fullbacks high and wide and both wingers in the half-spaces. This happened mostly when Maxwell played on the left as he is more attacking-minded than Abidal. At this variation, Iniesta would be a little bit deeper.
Only few opponents forced Barcelona to build up deep, as the opposition was often feared of giving more spaces to the midfielders. They therefore sacrificed pressure on the first line of Barcelona’s build-up.
But if the opposition sometimes pressed higher, to put pressure on the centre backs, Barcelona could often easily bypass them.
When pressing higher, most opponents used two players to press Barca’s centre backs. In the deep build-up, Barcelona could use the keeper (Valdes) as the free man, to create a 3v2 overload. The centre backs then would often split wide and deep, to give Valdes more time and space.
The usage of the keeper often had many positive effects to Barcelona’s build-up play. A backwards pass and a pass to the keeper are often pressing triggers for most opponents. This usually led to a striker, who initially marked a centre back, pressing Valdes. Then, the centre back would be the free man.
Even better for Barcelona could be, after a forward, who initially marked a centre back and then pressed on Valdes, another player would take the centre back over. This would again leave a new player free, in a higher position.
This scenario didn’t happen that often, though it showed that Barcelona always had an answer to what the opponent tried to do.
But as already mentioned, most opponents played deeper against Barcelona and would leave the first line free or less pressed.
Still, an overload in the first line was often created, to progress the ball cleaner into higher zones.
Against one striker, the centre backs would naturally have a 2v1 overload, meaning no change in the structure was necessary.
Against two forwards, even though they didn’t press that much, Barcelona liked to have an 3v2 overload. There were a few ways to create the back three:
One was to have Busquets dropping between both centre backs. The centre backs would then move wider and the fullbacks pushed higher up. This enabled the centre backs to be free, have bigger spaces and dribble forwards with the ball.
Sometimes, Xavi dropped between the centre backs or besides one centre back, to create a back three.
The second big way was to use a deeper fullback. Abidal would often stay deeper, to form a temporary back three. This again enabled the centre backs to dribble forward as they had more cover. Moreover, the deep position of Abidal often pulled the opposition’s winger higher, meaning more space were created in the midfield.
As already mentioned, a back three enables the halfbacks to move forward with the ball as they have more cover. This advancing can be very beneficial, to unsettle a deep block.
Many teams aren’t prepared what to do if a centre back starts to dribble with high pace towards them. This quick change of dynamics gave Barcelona an advantage.
One obvious advantage is that by simply moving forwards with the ball, Barcelona was nearer to the opposition goal. Furthermore, it can create a free man or spaces. Any opponent has to press the advancing centre back, no matter what. If no one does, he could dribble freely to the opponent’s goal.
So, one player has to leave his initial marker to press the advancing centre back. This leaves one player unmarked. Either the advancing centre back can directly pass to him, or through another way. Barcelona is incredibly good at finding the free man. Something I will cover more later on.
This is why dribbling is so important for Guardiola: “My first question is always, ‘Can this guy dribble?’ I only want players who have that skill so that’s always what I look at. I want full backs and central defenders and midfielders and inside forwards and winger who can dribble. Because you can learn control and good passing…So, yeah, dribbling, that’s the key.” (Guardiola)
Now that we know, how Barcelona was able to get past the first line of pressure, let’s have a look on how they tried to progress the ball and get into valuable zones to eventually create chances.
First of all, with four players in the midfield (Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta and Messi), Barcelona often had an overload there. These four players mostly formed a box shape or an asymmetrical diamond.
The overload helped Barcelona to find a free player in the centre/half-spaces (the most valuable zones).
Sometimes, the overload was enough, to find the free player. Although, Barcelona also used some interesting mechanisms to find him if it wasn’t that easy.
Now, let’s have a look on some ways to find the free man:
As already mentioned, Barcelona used clever rotations and movements, to unsettle the opposition and eventually create a free man.
You can see the most basic rotation on the image above. Xavi moved deeper, nearly besides Busquets. This allowed Iniesta to move up. Moreover, Messi dropped deeper (mostly in front of Xavi) to create a box structure.
The movement of Xavi usually pulled a midfielder out of position. This opened more space for Messi in between the lines.
We could also often see Busquets making a horizontal movement slightly to the left. This could drag an opponent to the side, which opened space for Xavi to drop into and receive in a deep playmaking position, where he was especially strong.
This rotation occurred mostly, but all in all the midfield box was highly fluid. Sometimes it looked like a box and sometimes like a diamond. Though, the structure wasn’t the most important. What was most important was to create superiorities, find the free man and eventually progress towards the goal.
The fluidity and the rotations had many positive effects and intentions:
The players constantly moved in relation to each other. One big intention was to open passing lanes. Movements could drag defenders out of position, which opened passing lanes and spaces for other players.
The second intention was to move into these open spaces. The midfielders had such an incredible understanding of time and space. They dynamically occupied open spaces. This created a factor of unpredictability and made them harder to mark.
Every midfielder could occupy every space if it had an intention for the collective. That’s why Busquets could also sometimes move into higher zones, to occupy open spaces. The players always moved in relation to each other, therefore, someone needed to occupy Busquets’ central defensive midfield position if he moved up.
Furthermore, the rotations often forced man-oriented opponents to decide between strictly marking or handing over. This is a difficult task to handle. Therefore, a mixture of both often occurred and a player would be free.
Barcelona kept on performing these rotations until a player would eventually receive the ball with time and space. Though, these rotations weren’t the only mechanisms to progress further up.
Barcelona combined the movements with quick combinations, as you can see above. That’s were their famously known Tiki-Taka comes into play.
Sometimes it looked like that they just passed to each other to simply have the ball, but again, every pass had an intention.
“The intention is not to move the ball, rather to move the opposition.” (Guardiola)
The aim of Tiki-Taka, as seen on the quote above was always to manipulate the opponent in a way, to open spaces and create a free player.
Through their structure, Barcelona had small distances in the midfield, which enabled quick combinations that are difficult to defend. The Barcelona players were the best in the world, to execute those combinations.
At the quick combinations, the midfielders and Messi constantly moved related to each other, as already mentioned. Often in the box structure, but also even more fluid, when spaces were somewhere else.
The short passes attracted pressure. Especially, if Barcelona passed to a player with a backwards-facing view. This is often a pressing trigger for the opposition. The opponent thinks he can steal the ball from the player with the suboptimal view, but that’s not the case. The Barcelona player often made a one touch pass, to get out of the pressure. Therefore, the positioning around this player was important to create passing lanes. That’s where the rotations came into play.
When the opponent pressed the Barcelona player with the backwards-facing view, spaces somewhere else open and could be exploited by another player.
Moreover, due to the small distances, many opponents just pressed through and left their initial opponent free, to press another one. Due to Barcelona’s great structure and the mechanisms as already mentioned, they were able to find this free player.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is that the free man should always be supported, to progress further up and use his potential correctly. The midfielders always had that in mind. Their rotations helped the free man to either have more space or a passing option.
Another movement I’d like to mention, which isn’t necessarily a rotation, is the dropping to the side-line performed by Iniesta. This movement can have two effects.
Iniesta could either receive himself with space or he dragged an opponent to the side, opening spaces in the half-space.
Another rotation we often saw was a winger (mostly the right winger) switching positions with Messi. The winger then moved centrally to pin the opponent’s centre backs. This allowed Messi the move around even more.
It was mostly the right winger as he is usually positioned in the half-space and the right fullback occupied the right-wing zone. Meaning no real change in the structure occurred, but different player profiles had different positions.
The opponent often didn’t know how to react to this switch accordingly. The opposition’s fullback was usually tasked marking the winger and the centre backs marked Messi. Now, with the rotations, the opponent couldn’t carry out this task.
This dilemma combined with the high and dynamic role of the right back often forced the back line to leave Messi free and give him even more spaces than in a central position.
This rotation sometimes occurred surprisingly or Barcelona kept this switch of positions for longer periods.
On an individual level, there were two other major ways on how to find and create a free man:
The first was dribbling. I mentioned the dribbling of the centre backs, but also in the midfield, dribbles were very important to progress and eventually create chances.
In the centre, Barcelona didn’t just have the best creators, but also the best dribblers of all time. Players like Messi and Iniesta constantly waved through the opposition with their breath-taking dribbles. But again, this wasn’t just to show off. It also had an intention.
Their dribbles would attract pressure. When a player bypasses an opponent through a dribble, another player has to step up to press the dribbler. This creates spaces and potentially a free man somewhere else. Messi and Iniesta would often bypass numerous opponents and be surrounded by a lot of players.
The other individual way to find and create a free man were disguised passes. This refers to faking a pass to one player and then passing to another. The opponents can be manipulated for example through the view of the eyes or the body position.
This guides the opponent to a wrong passing option. The opponent often moves to the fake passing option, leaving the real one free.
All midfielders, but especially Busquets were masters at this skill.
Another way, to attract pressure were backwards passes. A backwards pass doesn’t gain space. Though, it can be the beginning of a new and better attack. Backwards passes attract pressure as the team with the ball doesn’t move nearer to the goal.
“[…] a back pass does not indicate fear, but the beginning of another, better play.” (Guardiola)
Mostly, only few players of the opponent move up after a backwards pass. This is dangerous, as these players leave their deeper positions, which can open space between the lines if the other teammates don’t move up.
If the whole team moves up after a backwards pass, spaces between the lines stay narrow and therefore difficult to access. Though, spaces behind can enlarge. If the forwards exploit these spaces, they have a dynamical advantage as the opposition just moved forwards.
Especially for Barcelona, the ability to attract pressure was very important as many opponents just sat deep and tried to defend with eleven players. Being able to constantly manipulate the opponent was a big factor of their incredible in-possession phase.
Sometimes, these mechanisms weren’t enough and Barcelona wasn’t able to get into valuable zones. This mostly happened if the opponent tried to congest the centre with as many players as possible.
The opponents would either use four midfielders or their wingers tucking inside (this occurred more often). This obviously helped the opponents to control the centre and give Barcelona’s midfielders less time and space.
But this led to another problem. By congesting the centre, spaces wide enlarged. This is also why Guardiola always wanted to have both wing zones occupied.
Through the constant occupation of both wing zones (mostly by the wingers or fullbacks), Barcelona could stretch the opposition and had always a passing option wide if the centre was congested.
Sometimes, Barcelona could purposefully play wide. An example would be the overload to isolate principle. This refers to creating an overload on one side of the pitch and then switching to the other side, to create a 1v1 there.
Barcelona often combined the switches with the pinning of the ball-far fullback. This would create even more spaces wide.
Barcelona had amazing wingers and fullbacks with incredible dribbling and crossing abilities. So, it wasn’t really a downgrade compared to going centrally. Nevertheless, Barcelona preferred to go through the middle.
“You have the ball on one side, to finish on the other.” (Guardiola)
Similar to the overload to isolate principle, generally Barcelona used a lot of switches to progress and create chances. Often, the opponents were able to have good local compactness at a specific area and stopped Barcelona from progress. From here, backwards passes and switches were very important.
I already wrote about why backwards passes are so important and why Barcelona used them. Something I didn’t mention was the position of a relay player. This refers to a player who positions himself behind others, to be a back pass option. Combined with the wing zone, Pep Guardiola always wanted to have this space/position occupied.
When being stuck on the wing, a backwards pass option can be highly important. That’s where the relay player comes into play. He usually positioned himself behind the wide player and in the half-space. This was near enough to the wide player and near enough to stay connected with the other players to potentially switch the point of attack.
As seen on an image earlier, which I used to represent a backwards pass, Alves is the relay player in the right half-space. Though, mostly a midfielder (Xavi & Iniesta) provided this back pass option. Sometimes the fullback would stay deeper in the relay player position.
Another position which is very important to be able to switch is the link playing position. Guardiola too always wanted to have this position/space occupied. The link player was mostly positioned centrally in front of the block. He can be the immediate option for the relay player or the player to play a switch to the other side.
Again, it didn’t matter who occupied this space unless it was occupied. But it was mostly Busquets, who positioned himself there. Sometimes, an 8 could occupy this space.
The link player is very similar to the relay player, as he can also be a back pass option. Though, he is positioned differently and even more important for a successful switch.
Many teams congested specific areas. Being able to switch the point of attack elsewhere had many positive effects. Due to those switches, the opponent constantly had to shift across. Sooner or later, the opponent just makes a mistake. For example, someone pushed up to far or someone didn’t move to the other side accordingly.
Although, the act of switching alone isn’t really effective. Sometimes, it can open spaces and create a free man, but mostly it’s about the following action. After a switch, it’s important to support the receiver and force the opponent to make as many decisions as possible.
This quote from Adin Osmanbasic summarizes best Barcelona’s way on how to find the free man: “The goal is to find the free or unmarked man by moving the ball, positioning, or player movement” (Osmanbasic).
Another big chance creation method was combined with Messi’s dropping movement in a false nine position. His dropping move often pulled a centre back out of position, opening spaces in behind. Immediately, as Messi dropped deep, other players (mostly wingers) started to make diagonal runs in behind, to exploit this space.
Villa and Pedro were very fast and had a great timing. Therefore, these runs often caused the opposition big troubles. They also looked to make these runs on the blindside of the opposition, making them even more effective.
Messi could then use his outstanding passing qualities to pick a run of his teammates. Sometimes, Messi would lay it off to another teammate who then could find the running players with a forward-facing view.
This chance creation method mostly was successful against opponents with a high defensive line. But it could also be seen to attack crosses in this way.
Everything I mentioned in this chapter combined forced the opponent to make as many decisions as possible. No matter what the opposition tried to do, Barcelona always seemed to have an answer and the opponent more and more questions.
I’d like to finish this section with a quote from the famous basketball player Stephen Curry, which perfectly describes Barcelona’s aim in possession: “The main goal is to just make the defense make as many decisions as you can so that they’re going to mess up at some point with all that ball movement and body movement and whatnot” (Curry).
As already mentioned in the introduction, I will now analyse Barcelona’s counterpressing. Yes, this article should mainly cover Barcelona’s in-possession phase, but their counterpressing was outstanding and it is also connected to the in-possession phase as the structure decides if the counterpressing is successful. Moreover, as Barcelona mostly wanted to have possession, their counterpressing was very important to immediately win the ball back.
“Without the ball, we are a disastrous team, a horrible team, so we need the ball.” (Guardiola)
The most important factor of Barcelona’s counterpressing was probably their structure. They always aimed to have small distances to each other. These small distances were a key part of their in-possession phase. As already mentioned, they used small distances to be able to make quicker combinations. Moreover, the different local overloads in possession also led to small distances to each other. This is a good starting point, but that’s not enough for a successful counterpressing. Let’s dive a little bit deeper.
“It’s about how you place yourself in relation to the others on the field when you have the ball and where you should be so that you can continue pressing when you lose it.” (Domènec Torrent)
@roshanrao_ on Twitter used an interesting approach on how to analyse the counterpressing from Manchester City here:
I will also use it a little bit to get a better understanding why Barcelona’s counterpressing was so good.
Basically, @roshanrao_ divides the structure around the counterpressing action into three zones:
“1. Zone of intervention — immediate engagement takes place on the ball
2. Zone of mutual help — support around the ball through numerical superiority
3. Zone of cooperation — Hold positions for width and depth” (@roshanrao_)
Let’s start with the first zone, the zone of intervention. This refers to immediately applying pressure on the ball-carrier after the ball is lost. Barcelona’s players instantly pressed the opponent after a ball loss with full pace. Mostly, the one or two nearest players would sprint towards the ball-carrier. Although, it wasn’t always about winning the ball back immediately. Sometimes, the presser ran through or looked to guide the opponent into a specific area.
Often it was just important to seemingly put the opponent under pressure even though the Barcelona player couldn’t win the ball back. This led to hesitation and often a mistake from the opponent.
Furthermore, it isn’t just important that immediate pressure is applied. The players also need to anticipate counterpressing actions quickly. The Barcelona players were masters at this. They constantly had in mind what would happen if the ball would be lost. Pressing triggers such as a Barcelona player with a bad body posture, a teammate under pressure or a great run from the opponent were signs to apply pressure. The Barcelona players would then slowly move over and backwards to be prepared for the counterpressing action but also for a potential counterattack from the opponent.
Secondly, the zone of mutual help. This refers to the players who position themselves around the ball to provide support and stability but at first don’t directly apply pressure. The occupation of this zones is very important as some teams can come through the zone of intervention. Players in the zone of mutual help can also act as a second wave.
At Barcelona, mostly around three or more players would occupy this zone. They looked to control the space around the ball by using the cover-shadow and often positioned themselves between the opponents. Also, the positioning on different vertical and horizontal lines helped to control the area.
Moreover, if Barcelona won the ball back, players in the zone of mutual help were often the first players who were seeked to play out of the congested area. Counterpressing actions are often very narrow and random. Having players positioned to get out of this space was also key.
Thirdly, the zone of cooperation refers to players who are positioned even further away. The aim of these players is to provide cover if the opponent can break through the first and second zone, e.g., with a long ball. Additionally, these players can also be outlet options after the ball is won from the counterpressing action.
This zone was usually occupied by the centre backs, the ball-far fullback and a midfielder to provide cover for a potential transition. Moreover, forwards would also be positioned in this zone to be the outlet and to transition forward after the ball was won back.
Sometimes, the structure wasn’t ideal or the opponent could play themselves out of the pressure. If this happened, usually the nearest player would still apply pressure and the other players would fall deep to provide cover.
This Barcelona side wasn’t just beautiful to watch, but also incredibly effective. Pep Guardiola brought the possession-based philosophy to the world of football and started an evolution. His Barcelona team was feared but also admired at the same time around the globe.
Something that shouldn’t be neglected is the individual quality of this squad. Without these outstanding players, it wouldn’t be impossible to achieve all this. Though, it’s the role of the coach to fit them into a functioning and effective system. Pep Guardiola definitely established this and should therefore be respected.
I hope you enjoyed this article! It’s my first piece on Medium, so I wanted to make something special. Moreover, I hope that this article was detailed enough but not too long at the same time.
Feedback is appreciated in any form whatsoever!

This post was created by Avery V., one of LearnLux’s 2018 Campus Ambassadors. All experiences & opinions are her own.
When researching the “minimal expenses” one can expect for a study abroad experience… I was blown away.
Apartment $1,200/ monthGroceries ~ $100/ weekRestaurants ~ $30/weekTravel ~ $250–400 Miscellaneous ~ $200/month
Total Average Cost per month ~ $2100
I thought to myself, how the hell am I supposed to afford blowing through 2,100 dollars at the “minimum” per month?
I try to be as financially independent as I can, therefore I worked last summer as well as through the first semester of my Junior year to prepare for study abroad. However, even with the past cash-flows, there was no way I was going to be able to afford such an expensive per-month price tag!
For six months in Barcelona, I was supposed to have, at minimum, 12,600 dollars? There HAD to be another way…
I decided to do some research and figure out how to slim down this budget. Prior to arrival, I decided to break down my weekly and monthly expenses.
Let’s think…I have both fixed and variable expenses. Fixed= something that is of a consistent value that is pre-planned ahead of time. Think of an apartment expense, a gym membership, or a prescription cost. My fixed expenses were: my apartment and my gym membership.
Next I began thinking about my variable costs. Variable expenses= a cost that can change depending on the amount and frequency payment of a good or a service. Think of groceries, going out at night, or impromptu purchases. My variable costs were: groceries, restaurants, shopping, bulk buys (makeup or household supplies), entertainment activities (ex: going to movies), daily transportation (Taxis, Uber, local busses), and so many others.
While in Barcelona, I expect to have a complete new category: Travel. The exciting, pivotal, and expen$ive component of the studying abroad experience. Between flights, trains, transportation, food, activities, and special moments, I made sure to be realistic in my budgeting for travel plans.
Lost and confused, I turned to my dad who helped me see more clearly. As a Financial Advisor for the past 30 years, he sure gave me advice (some I liked and others less so). He basically reiterated the importance of frugality, especially as a college student without continuous income. He loved Calvin Coolidge’s quote:
“There is no dignity quite so impressive, and no independence quite so important, as living within your means.”
He then broke it down with an example featuring the smallest of purchases: Coffee.
“So Avery, let’s say you go to Starbucks or Dunkin three mornings a week to grab a coffee before class. Thats roughly $4/ day and $12/week. If you do this 52 weeks of the year… that is $624 on coffee alone! Now, lets extrapolate that to your 4 years of college. If you were to only have 3 morning coffee’s for your time in college, that is $ 2,496. And that is just coffee…”
Wow. He definitely has a point considering I get coffee 4 days a week and pay an extra .50 cents for almond milk!
This conversation sparked a whole new perspective. I do not need to get caught up in our culture heavily fixated on the consumption of unnecessary goods. I do not need to cut coffee out of my diet. Instead, I can buy $10 coffee grounds that will make over 70 cups of coffee. I began to apply this mentality to EVERYTHING.
Here are the changes I made, that ended up making a big difference:
1. I switched out American brands for (cheaper) Spanish equivalents2. I found the most affordable grocery store where I could buy in bulk3. I attend farmers markets for my fresh produce, instead of paying over 70% mark up at the close by stores.4. I limited eating out at restaurants and make more food at home (both cheaper and WAY more healthy)5. I ditched that $6 Starbucks order that only increases your spending, as well as your waist size… I see you with your grande double caramel macchiato with one pump mocha syrup, two pumps hazelnut, light ice, chocolate powder, add cinnamon dolce top, with light whipped cream… ya I’m talking to YOU6. I take the very efficient public transportation system in Barcelona. My monthly ticket costs 76 euros and has unlimited swipes. This compares to taking a 5–12 euro cab to each destination.7. I remembered to KEEP IN MIND THE CONVERSION RATE. Currently the dollar to euro rate is 1 dollar= .80 euro. This makes everything even more than the price tag states. Very important to remember.8. I travel with friends! This cuts down the cost of living and allows you the freedom to live in a nicer more central location.
These changes, although small, REALLY lowered my budget for each month. This task reminded me to stay intentional, think about needs vs. wants, plan ahead, and practice being responsible. Everyone can budget and still participate in everything while abroad. Just limit the unnecessary purchases so you can sip on your extra-special latte at the top of the Eiffel tower.

I realized a long time ago that our lives are like football teams. Everyone needs a good team to have a chance at success.
Ultimately, what brings success is diligence and tactics — a balanced and a realistic plan. Tonight, Barca had everything: a good team, diligence but fell short due to their half baked plan.
Nathaniel Bassey is simply saying;
""know when to go all out and when to be reserved"".
If your plan lacks balance and realism, it is half baked. What Barca did in the last minutes of normal time lacked reality.
In a football team, everyone needs to be diligent at their respective duties to have a shot at success. It is the duty of attackers to create and convert chances while the defenders tighten security and stop attacks.
This applies to reality as well. Your team — which can also be your circle of friends or social circle, needs people who can bring and take opportunities, as well as people who can protect from being extorted. You need someone who understands the game enough to devise plans that drive you forward, as well as people who share the same interest as yours to be dedicated to your course.
Every team needs a good manager (the tactician), an X factor in attack and defense, and the will to succeed:
Be cautious of the team you buildBe cautious of the relationships you keepBe cautious of the circle you keepBe cautious of your aspirations.

In a crowded café on Barcelona’s Plaza Molina, they chant his name, exuberant at the flash of magic. Waiters pound their metal trays on the counter, college students throw their arms in the air, and old men shake their heads in disbelief. Together they shout his name with abandon, over and over again. Messi! Messi! Messi! He’s done it again. On this night, the shining light of Barcelona football has created a moment of legend, the type of play that turns mortal players into a name that is chanted into the night.
I found this café by accident, wandering down the hillside from my flat in Putxet. Plaza Molina, a busy Metro stop, was not my destination. Typically, I strolled past the bustling square on my way into Gràcia, skipping the little restaurants on the border of the plaza filled with commuters and business people stopping for drinks on the way home.
But the lights of a small place on the corner caught my eye. My only goal was to find a place to watch the Barca match and have a beer. The café was small, but I spotted an empty stool at the cramped counter. Drowned by the sound of the announcers booming from the TV, I…

Nearly every European country with a long wine-making tradition produces at least a few sweet wines, some of which have survived the ages and are still considered to be some of the worlds greatest expressions. To this day some Tokaji wines from Hungary, Sauterne from the south of Bordeaux, Trockenbeerenauslese from Germany and others command premium prices, despite the world drinking less fortified and sweet wines than ever before. Spain joins them in the production aspect, if not the price, with a plethora of sweet wine styles from Sherrys, sweet Muscats, Pedro Ximenez, Monastrell and others, and indeed has been making ‘rancio’ style wines since the beginning of our wine making history.
As with all sweet wines, the historical significance is really related to the practical issues of getting them around the world in one piece; going back even a little over a hundred or so years ago, moving a table wine from one country to to another was a good way to risk turning it into unpalatable vinegar. Sweet wines, on the other hand, with their stronger, headier flavours, higher levels of sugar and often higher levels of alcohol due to fortification were the drink of choice, as they would arrive at their destination more or less intact. This was particularly important in warm countries such as Spain, where a single hot day in the baking Mediterranean sunshine is enough to turn your fresh, fruity red wine into something quite dull and uninteresting.
However, with the advent of modern technologies, sweet and fortified wine sales have fallen through the floor over the last 40 years, with most modern consumers opting for lighter, drier wines that are usually a little easier to pair with food. Wines no longer need to be powerful and sweet to survive before being consumed and as a result, the market for sweet wines is dwindling away. One silver lining of this, of course, is that it’s generally the best producers who are left making the remaining wines, and they’ve been recently joined by some ambitious attempts to recreate different styles, often using very new technologies such as cryo-extraction in places not previously renowned for these styles of wine. It was my pleasure to introduce 5 such wines to our tasting last week and showcase the depth of options available in Spain alone, which whilst may not become the mainstay of an individuals collection, certainly have their place at the dinner table.
Gramona “Vi de Glass” Riesling 2011: We kicked off the evening with probably the least traditional style of fortified wine made in Spain; ice wine made not be the natural elements dropping down well below zero, but using a chamber designed to artificially freeze the grapes prior to pressing. This has been a technology used in France since the late 1980s but was started to be used by Gramona in 1997. The premise is identical to that of the natural production of ice wine in both Germany and Canada; freezing the water in the grapes and squeezing out a thick, viscous juice from the resulting press with a lot of varietal flavour, sugar and acid. However, doing this artificially gives a great deal of control over the process as you can choose at which temperature you’d like to freeze the grapes. The higher the concentration of sugar, the lower the temperature needed to freeze the water in the grapes themselves, and the less juice you receive per ton. Therefore, winemakers can now choose the quantity of the icewine they need and adjust the temperature accordingly; lower temperatures mean that only the ripest juice is allowed to leave the press, but lowers quantity substantially. In France the common practice is to freeze grapes at -6ºC. Gramona by comparison choose to make their wine at -15ºC. I was surprised at how good this was, retaining both the youthful fruit and minerality of the Riesling in a good balance with the sugar levels. The bottle is a little difficult to store, but makes for a wonderful centre piece!
Jorge Ordonez №2 Victoria 2015: We went from perhaps the least typical style of Spanish sweet wine to perhaps its most; sweet Muscat from Malaga. DO Malaga is interestingly the only DO in Spain to focus entirely on the production of sweet wine, having been influential in the courts of Medieval Europe and peaking in popularity in the 19th century with its recently revived “Mountain Wine”. Muscat de Alexandria, the ugly ducking to Muscat a Petit Grains, is rife here with its grapey, floral aromas, naturally high sugar and delicate nature. Jorge Ordonez has a range of 4 in total, all made in a naturally sweet style from over-ripe grapes, increasing in sugar level and flavour intensity. We went for number 2, Victoria 2015 which is a lovely, softly honeyed wine with a very approachable 10% ABV and a lovely light, delicately floral character. Of all the wines poured over the evening, this probably lasted the least amount of time in the glass!
Perelada Garntaxa de 12 Anys: Our first meeting with a fortified wine and we went for a sweet Grenache from the Emporda, a region in the very north of Catalunya bordering France. In fact, this proximity to France goes some way to explain the style of this wine, made as it is in a Solera system. The south of France, Roussilon in particular, is home to a great deal of appellations famous for producing sweet wine and the effects are felt in the north of Catalunya, where many of these old constructions still exist and are making top quality wine to this day. This is actually my favourite style of sweet wine from Catalunya, combining the lovely dried red fruit character of the Grenache with the long, slow 12-year ageing process of the Solera system to provide a complex, sweet and very endearing wine as a result. Perelada are a big company producing a lot of very good, and some decidedly average, wine, but I’d be happy to have a few bottles of this lying around at any given time!
Castaño Dulce 2013 — We headed down to the Levant for wine number 4 and a chance to try perhaps the least obviously sweet wine of the day. I say this because the sweet Monastrell, made from grapes dried in the sun and often fermented in open wooded vats, is more akin to a structured red wine with a lot of sugar than a traditional sweet wine. The Castañofamily have been revolutionary in DO Yecla, from helping win the DO regulatory system to investing heavily into opening international markets for the region and with the quality of the wine they’re producing now, I can safely say that it’s been a successful drive for a still relatively unknown area. Bold, bright and tannic, this would be a delicious pairing for medium-strength cheeses, light chocolate desserts and almost anything with red fruit in it.
Don PX Toro de Albala Gran Reserva 1986 — It wouldn’t be a sweet wine tasting if we didn’t dip our toe into the sweetest of them all; Pedro Ximenez, made in DO Montilla-Moriles with almost 380 grams of sugar a litre. Pedro Ximenez is one of the worlds naturally sweetest grape varieties, accumulating sugar rapidly, encouraged by exceptionally late harvesting when they’re essentially raisins on the vine. These dry grapes are then picked, pressed and fermented to a few degrees of alcohol before being fortified to retain this incredible level of sugar. PX, as it’s more commonly known, is still used to sweeten certain wines, often Sherry destined for ‘Cream’ status of some sort, but more often is aged in a Solera system for an incredibly long time, becoming deeply oxidised, concentrated and dark in the process. There are also single vintage PX wines like the above, aged in oak barrels for a staggering 28 years before commercial release. My personal preference is to drizzle this over vanilla ice-cream with walnuts and almonds, but a small glass is also a hedonistic pleasure from time to time!
This was certainly not a tasting for the faint of heart, but a real treat to try so many sweet wines from across the country. The general feeling before the tasting was one of “I don’t really drink sweet wines, so I’m interested to see how they fare.’ Based on the evidence, I hope we’ve converted a few more lovers of dessert wines, the industry certainly needs a few more! If you’d like to learn more about Spanish wine and attend a tasting in Barcelona, make sure to check out the options here, from private tastings to our weekly published tastings. Until then, salut!

For sixteen years now, OFFF takes place in Barcelona at the Museu de Disseny. It’s a platform where a vast variety of creatives share knowledge and experiences across all disciplines of Design. It’s where we go to drink and soak our creative souls.
Nowadays, OFFF is a creative hub and platform based in Barcelona with extensions all over the globe: Mexico City, Porto, Milan, New York City, you name it.
This year’s edition had an incredible line-up. From the holy Lance Wyman to legendary Vaughan Oliver, Imaginary Forces, Buck, or Vallée Duhamel, Annie Atkins, Stink Studios, Gary Baseman, Moving Brands, Anthony Burrill, Joshua Davis, and many many more.
The vibe and outside mood made it feel almost like a music summer festival.
Thursday I made sure to attend to Buck , a house of motion-graphics to be reckoned with. Here, the main venue had its biggest crowd of the day and it was completely justified. These guys are really solid and an inspiration. Just check the video below and you will know what I mean. Fascinating to learn how this short was created and realize that everything really starts with pen and paper.
Afterwards, it was Vaughan Oliver’s turn. I was looking forward to this one. Oliver was a delight to listen to — to learn how he created, back in the 80’s, together with the 4AD label, some of the incredible album covers for The Cocteau Twins, Breeders, Lush or Pixies. Looking back, as he said, he ended up doing what he loved most — designing covers of music albums, specially during that exciting post-punk period. His work is very recognizable — bold, vigorous, and ironic at times. Photography played a huge part in his work. He collaborated intensively with Chris Bigg throughout his golden days at 4AD, juxtaposing powerful imagery with puzzling blackmail lettering. Pure graphic design.
The crowd now was not as enthusiastic nor as full as with Buck; you could see that the young scene is not really familiar with Oliver, and I couldn’t help feeling bad for him. A great opportunity wasted out the window! Generation gap, I suppose.
The first day was coming to an end, and Imaginary Forces were the last speakers. These are the guys behind the hyped Stranger Things TV show main titles, Mad Men, Jessica Jones, Band of Brothers, Boardwalk Empire or Vinyl. Karen Fong and Michelle Dougherty were the speakers in charge.
Again it was interesting to see that even with the most mainstream media, everything starts with a piece of paper and a pencil.
It’s a very hands-on process, very intuitive and empiric some-how. For the Jessica Jones main titles sequence, for instance, they wanted to be true to the original covers of the comic books Jessica Jones: Alias, by David Mack, in which he uses watercolors profusely, something that became very iconic and popular among the fans. So, they started exploring ways of filming and portraying ink mixing with water, on glass or other media. The idea was to blend it eventually with actual footage.
Friday, was the day of Annie Atkins and Moving Brands.
“My name is Annie and I do graphic design for movies”.
That’s how Atkins introduced herself to the crowd. Annie is from Dublin and studied at Film School, only to realize that what she’s really passionate about is, actually, graphic design. Her first job was doing the graphic design for the 2007 Showtime The Tudors. She was working with the graphic design department on the show, and would create everything that you can think of: from patterns for tapestries, to medieval calligraphy on a wide variety of documents of the kingdom of Henry VIII.
The project was successful would lead to new opportunities and eventually she managed to work with directors like Steven Spielberg (on A Bridge of Spies) or Wes Anderson, on The Grand Budapest Hotel. Here her role as a graphic designer got to its higher, since she and her peers had to design virtually everything to the fictional Empire of Zubrowka. Documents, stamps, passports, telegrams, newspapers (!), maps, or other items, like packaging for pastries or even book covers. It was interesting to learn the difference between hero props and regular props, background props; some of these props are of course always in the background, out of sight, out of focus even, whilst when you have a hero prop, like the Mendl’s pastries box in The Grand Budapest Hotel, eventually you may get to have your piece shine in the silver screen for 2–3 seconds, in all it’s majestic glory.
In film, every item is unique and has to be replicated at least a dozen of times, so that, for instance, an actor can open an envelope (prop) on any given take and that this envelope is new and look the same, with its stamp and handwriting looking the same from a scene that possible did appear before in the film. Atkins loves her craft. She truly does.
Moving Brands turn was up next, with co-founder Jim Bull. Well known among us creatives, Moving Brands has offices across the globe. Originally from the North of England, Bull gave a non-apologetic talk, direct, honest and inspiring. Their work speak for themselves, so Jim was more interested in sharing mind-sets: sheepism, as he called it, is a terrible but avoidable tendency that ought to be stopped. We, as creatives that are responsible, must avoid sheepism at all costs, to follow hollow trends that lead to empty and fake brands that look like carbon copies of each others. Brands that in the end lack added value or recognition at all.
Saturday was the last day and I tried to make the most out of it. American illustrator and painter Gary Baseman, was interesting, unexpected, wild and crazy.
Anthony Burrill, gave a talked focused on typography and letterpress. Burrill shared is love for bold shapes, urban signs and symbols. To be passionate and honest about yourself and your work. He is the creator of the poster Work Hard & Be Nice to People, all set and printed manually, on a letterpress machine.
And lastly, Lance Wyman. Graduated from Pratt Institute in NYC, Wyman is regarded as one of the greatest, just like Paul Rand or Otl Aicher.
It’s incredible to think that Wyman was only 29 years old when he won the pitch for the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games. A time that brought him success, recognition and effectively launched his now long and vast career.
As he shared with us, at the time, he and his partner didn’t have enough money to get return tickets from Mexico, so they ended up staying there for a few years, leading up consequently to work on the Mexico City Metro visual identity as well, something that Wyman is very proud of, especially how such a complex premise could be simplified and systematized virtually using only a set of bold icons and colors — something still new at the time.
Wyman has transformed cities and public spaces across the world through the simple power of iconography. It is a reminder that often good design is timeless, pure, simple — and above all transversal and understandable to all cultures.
All in all, OFFF Barcelona is an experience you should not miss, refreshing and inspirational.
So, OFFF 2018, May 24–26. Make sure to be there.

The non remote events are back, which is great!
I had the opportunity to attend for the first one (for me) after the pandemic and I did a little summary to share my thoughts about it.
I am Borja Pernía, a Venezuelan software developer who has lived in Barcelona since 2012. I have been working at ManoMano since January 2020 and I like to assist to different events related to software development.
For personal reasons, I only could assist the first day during the morning and this is the summary of the talks that I assisted.
They talked about the necessity to use OpenTelemetry
Important concepts in observability
First steps into the Voxel implementation
What is OpenTelemetry?
Demo time!
Questions & Answers
Quick overview of data disciplines
The infrastructure for handle data in Hotjar
About data qualityImportant: accuracy, consistency, completeness, timeliness, validity, uniqueness
Lessons learned
As a summary, the talks that I assisted had interesting topics that could help us to improve our day-to-day work in several levels (to know several ways to have a better functional programming experience, to understand how to monitorize our applications in a correct and simpler way or starting to build a BI infrastructure based on the experience of somebody that already lived it).
I enjoyed coming back to a face-to-face event with a great set of speakers, , and a good mood among the crowd. I hope to attend next year’s edition too :)
If you want to continue the conversation about this or other events, contact or chat with me on LinkedIn.
As usual in this kind of events, the opening was a moment to present the team involved and thanked to the sponsors (ManoMano included! \o/ ). Something that was new for me: the post-covid protocol during the event (use of masks, leave the rooms at the end of the talks, etc.) and the presentation of two organizations (BCN women who code and Codebar).

It was Christmas time in Barcelona, and I was facing a creature I’d never encountered before: a log with a painted-on smiley face, wearing a Santa hat. This wasn’t Rudolph or Frosty; this was “Tio de Nadal,” and apparently, I was supposed to beat it with a stick. Welcome to Catalonia, right?
That’s how my adventure in Barcelona began — a whirlwind of cultural quirks, language barriers, and unexpected discoveries. My journey started when I followed my husband to his hometown, leaving behind my familiar life in Indonesia. I was a graphic designer by profession, but little did I know that this move would lead me down a new career path and spark a whole new set of passions.
My career started in the vibrant world of children’s publishing, where I worked as an art designer for a foreign magazine with a local editorial team in Indonesia. It was a fun and creative environment, but I soon felt the pull to explore new horizons. That led me to a graphic design and marketing promotion role for a real estate and hospitality company in a different city. This was my first taste of the marketing world, and I quickly realized I had a knack for it.
A few years later, I landed a position as a creative designer and digital marketer for a factory. This was where my fascination with the digital world truly blossomed. I was immersed in website design, social media campaigns, and the ever-evolving landscape of online marketing. And then came AI — the game-changer that sparked a whole new level of curiosity in me. I was hooked!

Learning a new language is like navigating a maze blindfolded. You bump into walls, take wrong turns, and occasionally stumble upon a hidden gem. That’s been my experience with Spanish and Catalan.
Despite my best efforts (and countless hours with Duolingo), my progress has been…let’s just say “gradual.” But I’ve learned to embrace the stumbles, the mispronounced words, and the occasional blank stares. It’s all part of the adventure.
The truth is, my attempts to speak Spanish often end up as a jumbled mix of Spanish, English, and even some Catalan thrown in for good measure. “Spanglish” with a Catalan twist, anyone? But hey, I’m learning, and that’s what matters.
Amidst the linguistic chaos, I found solace in a surprising place: Sashiko and embroidery. These intricate crafts, with their repetitive stitches and calming rhythms, became my refuge. They provided a sense of accomplishment and a way to connect with a new culture through its traditional art forms.
As an introvert, moving to a new city always presents a unique set of challenges. But trading the familiar hustle and bustle of Jakarta and Surabaya for the vibrant energy of Barcelona brought a new dimension to my introverted experience. While both Indonesia and Spain have their own brand of urban energy, the cultural shift and the unfamiliarity of my surroundings amplified my need for solitude. I found myself retreating into the comfort of our house, venturing out mostly for errands or when accompanied by my husband.
But here’s the thing: I didn’t feel lonely.
In fact, I discovered a newfound sense of fulfillment in my solitude. I filled my days with new hobbies, exploring the city at my own pace, and diving deeper into the digital world that fascinated me. I learned to embrace my introversion, finding joy in the quiet moments and the freedom to explore my own interests.
My journey in Barcelona has been a tapestry of unexpected turns, new passions, and personal growth. From accidental digital marketer to “Spanglish”-speaking crafter, I’ve embraced the challenges and discovered new facets of myself along the way. And while my introverted nature might keep me close to home most days, I’ve found a rhythm that works for me, a balance between solitude and connection, exploration and comfort.
I’m constantly learning and adapting, embracing the changes and challenges that come with living in a new country. And I’ve come to realize that the most rewarding part of this journey is not just the destination, but the process itself.
Looking back on my journey, I’ve learned a few valuable lessons:
I hope my story inspires you to embrace change, embrace your individuality, and pursue your passions, no matter where you find yourself in the world.

I like to participate in boutique-like forest trail ultras where there are only a handful of runners but last month I somehow managed to run the Zurich Barcelona Marathon with 16000+ runners signed up.
I usually don't care about my finishing time as any finished ultra is a success for me regardless of time. But now I ran a marathon distance with many other runners and this made me think about the end result.
I found this presentation of my result clean and simple but incredibly boring.
My finishing time was 3:31:44. I'm relatively happy with that time but I know that I got tired in the end. How did that compare to the people around me? How fast are the pro runners compared to me?
I decided to take all the results I could find and write a small program that would give me a more visual overview of the event.
First thoughts:
I also took a look into the finishing times and it seems that people who aimed under 3h and under 4h were pretty successful (no peak after the time in a graph) but it seems that a lot of runners with aim of 2h45min, 3h30min and 4h15min barely missed their mark.
The slower you are, the more you slow down in the second half of the race. People around the 4h finishing time were avg 10% slower in the 2nd half, that means a whopping 24min added.
And the race starts from the 25th km :) Almost everybody is able to hold the pace till 25th km but every next kilometre is getting harder to keep the pace.
Regardless of your results, it's amazing to see so many people running! We are all winners!

Each new trip announced by Celebrity sounds better than the last. Clearly the trip of a lifetime for many would be to spend some time in Rome, then cruise through the Greek Islands, and end up in Barcelona. That is the opportunity you will have if you book this incredible journey for ten days beginning in Rome on September 5, 2022. What makes it even better is this trip is on Celebrity’s newest ship BEYOND.
Now that alone sounds exciting, but add Celebrity has announced celebrating the BEYOND, and traveling with you, will be no less than Celebrity Cruises’ President and CEO, Lisa Lutoff-Perlo. Just imagine being on the ship with her, with Captain Kate McCue at the helm, and special host and Greece native, Captain Dimitrios Kafetzis, who will lead everyone on amazing tours throughout the sailing. It doesn’t get better than this.
This cruise gives regular Celebrity travelers a chance to reconnect with fellow Captain’s Club members meeting old friends and making new ones. There will be special events like a Santorini sail away with local entertainment, cuisine, and as usual in the Greek Islands one of the most beautiful sunsets in the world.
Now you begin your journey in Rome where you will meet the ship. If you are like me, you will want to spend a few days in Rome before you board. One can’t help love this Eternal City. The incredible Trevi fountain where you will throw a coin in to guarantee you will return again and again.
Then if you haven’t seen it before you must take this opportunity to embrace the power of Michelangelo’s vision at the truly inspiring Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. Then you board your ship on September 5th and take a walk around to start to appreciate its incredible beauty.
The excitement mounts for your visit to eight different ports. First Olympia, where the first Olympic Games were held in 776 B.C. Then among other exciting adventures discover the prehistoric Akrotiri ruins in Santorini, and enjoy the world-famous sunset while sipping some wine from a local vineyard. Hike to the spectacular Lindos Acropolis summit in Rhodes, and marvel at the Temple of Poseidon’s ancient glory in Athens. In Malta, admire the glittering baroque interior of St. John’s cathedral. Of course, no trip through the Greek Islands would be complete without a stop in beautiful Mykonos with its narrow white washed streets, my favorite Island, where I have spent many memorable vacations over the years.
Then while onboard this incredible newest of the Edge® Series ships, you can experience a signature restaurant by the renowned Chef Daniel Boulud (make your reservation early); the reimagined Grand Plaza inspired by the piazzas of Italy; a Rooftop Garden that extends out beyond the ship’s edge; and the new expanded two-tiered Sunset Bar. The Sunset Bar being one of my favorite places on any Celebrity ship.
You will be treated to great entertainment in the BEYOND’s theater which surpasses all other ships with its state-of-the-art technology. Then you end your cruise in the exciting city of Barcelona and what could be better than that?
I have been told by friends who took BEYOND’s maiden cruise that once onboard you will understand what Celebrity has said; this ship was designed to change the way you experience the world. Even the incredible artwork on board is worth the trip.
So look at your calendar. It you have the time, or can make the time, get in touch with Celebrity or better yet my travel agent Scott Moster, an expert on Celebrity and all cruises, at scott@myluxcruise.com; and book this exciting cruise today.

Hop on the time machine for a moment. We are going back to 2011. FC Barcelona was arguably the best club in the world. Nobody can forget their attacking, quick-passing, total football display versus a stacked Manchester United side managed by Sir Alex Ferguson under the lights of the great Wembley Stadium in the Champions League final. The match ended 3–1 with a goal apiece from Barcelona’s starting front 3 as they were crowned champions of Europe. Experts and pundits predicted a decade of dominance from the Blaugranas with Pep Guardiola at the helm and exciting youngsters from La Masia under his wing.
Fast-forward to 2021, FC Barcelona are in a financial mess, of around 1 billion Euros, unable to register their greatest player ever and their new signings due to the extreme wage budget. Things on the pitch haven’t been great either, with humiliations vs Roma, Liverpool, Bayern and PSG in the last 4 years being the main talking points. They do have, what many fans believe to be, the perfect leader in Joan Laporta. He has to clean this financial mess and needs to make proper signings to bring the club to where it used to be. He has made a few in Aguero, Depay, Emerson and Eric Garcia. Eric Garcia seems to be the replacement for the ageing Pique. There are other options in that position in Oscar Mingueza and the very promising, Ronald Araujo.
But the glaring void is seen in the left centre-back position. Clement Lenglet has never been the same since the Bayern debacle, with his numerous mistakes leading to costly points dropped in the league and Samuel Umtiti is not even a shadow of himself after constant injuries and pretty much zero game time. I personally think that the club needs a new signing at the left CB position and must look for one in this summer itself, if possible. So, in this article, we see some of the available and affordable options in that position and hopefully, finalize one player to help Barcelona fill the void.
All the data used in this article is from the brilliant fbref.com and the videos used for eye-test is from fullmatchsports.com.
REQUIREMENTS FOR A FC BARCELONA CENTRE-BACK
1. The current manager, Ronald Koeman started out with a 4–2–3–1 upon his arrival and moved to a 3–5–2/3–1–4–2 as he gathered that his CBs were being exposed in a 4-at-the-back system with their lack of pace. His decision to switch to a back three has produced good results and Barcelona has gained a bit of stability since. So, our centre-back should be able to slot in the left of a three-at-the-back system and as the left CB in a 4-ATB, if Koeman plans to revert back to one.
2. The centre-back should have excellent ball distribution. He should be able to play the ball out from the back with minimal errors. He must be able to distribute passes from the back to the LB(Mostly Jordi Alba) and line-breaking passes to the midfielders. He should also be able to carry the ball forward with confidence and find one of the teammates when there is space ahead.
3. He should be very good under pressure and be able to get himself out of it using quick thinking and good decision-making.
4. Jordi Alba is often closer to the attackers than the defenders. So, our new CB must take the responsibility of providing cover in the left flank. Even if he lacks pace, he must be very aware positionally and thus help the team to regain possession quickly by winning the ball when the opponent decides to break and counter.
5. He must be good aerially and make sensible decisions when opponents take the long-ball approach.
6. In a 3 ATB, he will play with Eric Garcia and Ronald Araujo mostly. Garcia is a very ‘Pique’ type defender, not too quick but relies heavily on his positional awareness and a decent on-the-ball defender. Araujo is strong, aerially dominant, faster than the average centre-back but doesn’t possess the best ball playing qualities. Our CB must compliment both the CBs by providing cover for Garcia’s lack of pace and Araujo’s lack of technicality.
7. Brownie points if he has already played in a team which plays possession-based attacking football.
THE FIRST DRAFT
Our first draft of players includes left-footed CBs in top clubs from Europe’s top 5 leagues. The selected CBs play in clubs only from which Barcelona can buy, so players from direct domestic rivals and Euroepan rivals are excluded. The 5 CBs from our first draft in no particular order are :
We will now use the fbref data available to get an idea of what each player offers to their respective teams and what they can offer for FC Barcelona. All the data is from the 2020/21 league season and is adjusted to per 90 minutes. The five-man draft will be deduced to a final shortlist of three for eye-test.
DATA ANALYSIS
Defensive Contribution : In this plot, we measure the defensive capabilities of the CBs using their Tackles+Interceptions numbers and Successful pressures that helped their team win the ball back. From the possession-adjusted data, we can clearly see how Bastoni leads his peers in both metrics. Botman is not far either. Pau Torres fails to impress here.
Discipline : Unsuccessful tackles or pressures might lead to fouls and bookings and this plot gives an idea of how clean/dirty the CBs are. Botman is the cleanest of them all, even though he had higher tackling and pressure numbers. Laporte obviously has higher numbers considering him playing in a team that dominates possession almost every game.
Passing : A very important attribute for a FC Barcelona centreback. Laporte excels in both progressive and final third passes while Botman, Pau and Bastoni have good numbers too. Romagnoli doesn’t make a case for him here.
Carries : While Bastoni leads in final third carries, Laporte once again exhibits his brilliant on-ball ability by completing around 10 progressive carries p90. Romagnoli does not possess the same on-ball characteristics as the others.
Aerial Prowess : Something that is a must for a Barca CB is good aerial ability. Teams tend to exploit the high defensive line of Barcelona and the CBs have to be aware of balls over the top to the forward or in the wings. Laporte once again leads the pack with Romagnoli second and Botman a close third.
From the above metrics, there are three standouts.
Alessandro BastoniAymeric LaporteSven Botman
With eye-test by watching previous matches, the strengths and weaknesses in each of the three players’ game are noted. There are few other factors in each player which are also taken into consideration. They will be explained below. Now, let us take a look at each player.
ALESSANDRO BASTONI
Pros : Bastoni is widely regarded as the future of Italian defence. At such a young age of 22, Bastoni has already established him as an undisputed starter at Inter. He has already played in a 3 ATB under his club manager Antonio Conte. Bastoni is skilled in switching the play to the right wingback with quick and accurate switch passes. He also often finds Lukaku by threading a ball over the top in/around the left half space behind the defensive line. This can be mirrored here, by using Fati/Depay as the receiver. This could benefit Barcelona when they are trying to find a way through low-block teams. He is also a very confident ball carrier and has the ability to find a progressive/key pass following that carry. He is quick enough to recover when he loses possession.
Cons : Bastoni doesn’t have any obvious weaknesses in his personal game. There are some other factors, though. His defensive partners at Inter have been two experienced CBs in Milan Skriniar and Stefan De Vrij. While Barca needs some experience to settle their defence for their pursuit of the league and the Champions League, signing Bastoni means he becomes one of the many young defenders Barca have. It is also a huge gamble to bring him from Serie A to La Liga for such a huge price (60M Euros according to transfermarkt.com, might even be more), which makes him the most expensive defender in La Liga history. A question remains on would he justify the price tag. Barca cannot afford another failed transfer, if Bastoni does fail.
Verdict : Bastoni is an excellent defender and a fantastic investment for the future. He possesses all qualities to become a Barcelona defender but in the current financial situation, he is an expensive, ambitious and risky option who Barca might have to stay away from, for now.
AYMERIC LAPORTE
Pros : Laporte has lost his place to Ruben Dias in the city defence. He is such a quality defender to not be playing regularly. Laporte had a brilliant Euro 2020 partnered with either Garcia or Pau Torres. He has the knack of finding line-breaking passes and is a supreme carrier of the ball, one of the best in the business. He has brilliant positional awareness and commits minimal errors while playing out from the back. He has played in a 3 ATB in City in a few instances. He also plays under Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique who share the similar philosophy as Barca. He is cheaper(45M Euros according to transfermarkt.com) and has better experience in big stages. There are various news outlets suggesting that he wants out because of his lack of game time.
Cons : Laporte’s only weakness might be his lack of pace. Also, Manchester City might not sell another CB as that would leave them with only three natural centre-backs(Dias, Stones, Ake). They might demand huge money. Barca may have to sell two or more players to meet City’s asking price.
Verdict : Laporte is a low-risk high quality CB, who fits in Barca’s defence like a glove but there are a few complications financially, which should be solved for this transfer to go through.
SVEN BOTMAN
Pros : Fresh from winning Ligue 1 with Lille, Botman is one of the most sort out CBs at the moment. He is 195 cm tall, strong and physically imposing which is very similar to Ronald Araujo. But, he differs from Araujo in the fact that he has brilliant on-the-ball quality. He often finds the LW/LB with a through ball behind the lines that puts them in space to run into. He is also brilliant in 1v1 situations and makes calculated tackles. Due to his height and huge physique, he can be a much needed set-piece threat. He is the least expensive of the three options(28M Euros according to transfermarkt.com).
Cons : Just 21 years old, Barcelona cannot expect any kind of experience from the dutchman. He is not a natural ball carrier like Laporte and is not upto the mark in his aerial distribution. He also struggles a bit when put under pressure and makes some hasty decisions. He has often played in a 4 ATB system, but has never been tested in a 3 ATB system.
Verdict : Though less expensive, Botman has had only one season in the Ligue 1 and it would be a huge gamble if Barcelona decide to keep faith on him, which I think is not the best thing to do.
CONCLUSION
Laporte definitely edges both of them with his experience. Even though his price is a problem, his recent success in the Euros and him sharing the same dressing room with Alba, Busquets, Pedri and Garcia means he would be the most fitting of all the options. 45M is a monstrous price in these circumstances but he has already proven his quality in the PL after arriving at Manchester City with a similar price tag. FC Barcelona receives a centre-back who fits their playstyle and more importantly, brings much needed experience and quality. Come on Mr. Laporta, import Laporte to the Nou Camp !

Have you ever found yourself running on empty, going through the motions without really feeling connected to what you’re doing?
That’s where I was before this trip. There’s a point when you realize you’re just… tired. Not just physically, but emotionally and creatively. I needed this trip not just to escape but to find myself again.
We live in a world that worships hustle, where productivity is often measured by how much we do, how busy we are, and how little we rest. I’ve always been someone who pushes through, who keeps going even when I know I’m running on nothing but coffee and maybe sugar lol. But as I wandered through the streets of Barcelona, from the towering Sagrada Familia to the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter, I realized something.
These iconic places are filled with life and energy, but instead of feeling energized, I realized I was missing the point. I was so focused on seeing everything and doing everything that I wasn’t truly experiencing any of it. Even on the subway, surrounded by people, I felt disconnected, like I was just going through the motions. It hit me that maybe, just maybe, it was okay to slow down and not do it all.
Rest isn’t just about lying down or sitting still. It’s about giving yourself permission to move at your own pace, to let go of the need to be constantly productive. As I walked through the narrow streets of Alfama, I felt something shift. The colorful buildings, the quiet moments — they invited me to slow down and just be.
Sitting at Castelo de Sao Jorge, looking out over the city, I didn’t feel the usual urge to capture the perfect photo or check off the next item on the list. Instead, I let myself just enjoy the view, the company, the moment. When we wandered into a little perfume store, it wasn’t about buying something; it was about the simple pleasure of experiencing something new, something beautiful, without any pressure. These small moments reminded me that it’s okay to simply exist, to find joy in the present.
Something I hadn’t expected was how much inspiration I would find just by slowing down and paying attention. In the midst of the busy streets, the street art, the intricate tiles, the history embedded in the architecture — even these chairs all over Barcelona — it all started to speak to me in a way I hadn’t felt in a long time.
Everywhere I looked, there was something that sparked my imagination — a piece of street art that made me pause, a beautifully tiled floor that told a story, even the way the buildings stood, each with its own history and character. It reminded me that creativity isn’t always about creating; sometimes, it’s about observing, about letting the world around you fill you with new ideas and perspectives. I realized that inspiration is everywhere if you just take the time to see it.
But beyond the beauty of the cities and the inspiration I found in the streets, what really stayed with me were the moments of connection. Sharing a meal, laughing with friends, those little moments of joy — they’re what made this trip truly meaningful. Like when we finally got our hands on those infamous Pastel da Nata from Pasteis de Belem — AMAZING.
Whether it was enjoying crepes, chatting at the plaza while eating gelato at midnight, or just sitting down for brunch at 4 p.m. because we felt like it — these moments weren’t about doing something impressive. They were about being present with the people I care about, about savoring life in its simplest, most joyful forms. And honestly, that’s where I found the most rest — in those small, meaningful moments that reminded me of what’s really important.
As I walked down the well in Quinta da Regaleira, it felt like a metaphor for what this trip had been — descending into the unknown, into a place of quiet and reflection. And just like that well, this journey brought me back up, feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to move forward. I realized that rest is its own form of productivity. It’s in those moments of stillness and quiet that we find the clarity we need to truly grow.”
I came on this trip looking for a break, a way to recharge. What I found was that rest isn’t just about doing nothing — it’s about finding the space to reconnect with yourself and to rediscover what brings you joy and peace.
So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this trip, it’s that it’s okay to take a step back. To slow down, to rest, and to reconnect with what really matters. When you give yourself permission to rest, you’re not just recharging — you’re laying the foundation for everything that comes next.

I was in Barcelona for an event last week. Also, it’s the first time in Barcelona for me. I know that the city is one of the best as the “city design” in the world. But I saw it with a different eye. Can it be also the best city as we think in user experience?
First of all, I loved the city. In Europe, there is just Portugal I haven’t visited yet and the only city/country that I want to live in is Rotterdam. It is a “lively” city that has lots of foreigners and everyone knows English (so I don’t need to learn Dutch that I already learned!). Also, there are lots of “expats” so you feel comfortable as a foreign. And, of course, Berlin is the city that I want to go to again and again :). After all, Barcelona is the second city I want to go to again and maybe to live there!
I loved the city not because everyone knew English and I felt comfortable about everything (to be honest, just a few people know English, we had such hard times to communicate). I loved the city because both the city and the people make you feel comfortable about living in the environment.
As I said, I saw just a few people who know English very well, and again just a few who know English “a little” to communicate. But after all, even if they didn’t understand what I was asking, they got the “situation” and tried to help me. In Turkey, we sometimes have fun with these “a little English” people who try to explain the route you’ve asked with “Go go go, left, go go, right, go, there”. And I also saw them in Barcelona! After all, I handle everything with them. So, even if you don't know English, you can communicate with them, just show what you want.
Like they don’t speak that much English, they also don’t use English signs. That is also because they use Catalan as their first language and Spanish is the second, so mostly there is no space for an English word. But you can use the city without a foreign language because of their signs! In the metro, you mostly can’t see an English word but with their sign language, you can go wherever you want. For example in Turkey, at the stations we both use Turkish and English announcements and signs. But if you also don’t know English, you will have a hard time. But in Barcelona, they use the line numbers, the line flow, and some good signs to show where to go and where to wait.
I also see those signs at the airport. For example, if you need to do something about tax-free, you need to go to Terminal 1. But our flight was from Terminal 2 and we just looked at that sign and realized we needed to go that way to find our “shuttle”. Also, they put the same sign at the door that we need to go through.
I need to mention another thing if we are talking about the city's accessibility. I saw so many people with wheelchairs and with a walking stick because they couldn’t see. Those people were all alone, there was no one to help them with the lights, sidewalk, or getting in a store. They can do all of these by themselves.
I try to create websites that everyone can “access”, everyone can use it smoothly and feel comfortable as they do these. From now on, I want to make websites like Barcelona! And hope to see it again :).

— -A fruitful ramble — —
Without a plan or map, we landed on the sun-kissed landstrip of Barcelona airport.
The short flight from London seemed like more of a teleport than a form of transport, zapping us from the soupy grey hue of London into a blossoming explosion of vibrant Catalonian colour. The warm embrace of the sun was enough to send spirits soaring as we rushed through Spanish security and emerged into the heat.
Following our landing, we took an airport shuttle (the A1) from Barcelona airport to plazza Espanya, where we proceded to a quick check in at the Ofelias hotel, located just off the impressive Plazza Espanya. A city square packed with the hustle and bustle of everyday Catalonian life, capped with a monumental fountain by Josep Maria Jujol, one of Gaudí’s main associates.
To escape the crowds and the rising heat, we took a short metro ride on the L1 line to the more quieter Gracia borough, a serene district with shaded backstreets, sloping lawns and bohemian cafe culture.
Gracia was as peaceful as expected. A tranquil setback from the initial and intense buzz of the sweaty Plazza Espanya, a welcome oasis.
After a short walk through shaded alleys, we took a seat at one of Gracias shaded restaurants, located on a Gaudi street corner. Gracia’s solace was complimented with a crisp lager Estrella (the first of many) and a crisp white wine.
Time for tapas. Accompanying the drinks were lobster croquets, cured meats, tomato breads and garden olives; all enjoyed under the shady confines of a terraced side street.
After lunch, we pushed on, stumbling down quieter alleyways, cafes, bars but local shops were beginning to close their blinds to the afternoon sun; with a siesta break approaching.
Pastel painted walls dotted the backstreets backstreets, apartments squeezed down leaning alleys, their astute balconies almost brushing the wall opposite, rising high into the Barcelona rooftops.
Small potted plants and foliage spill through each wrought iron balcony, giving the apartments of Barcelona a living and breathing dimension. The gentle tinker of a Spanish guitar escapes through a bedroom window, a picture book setting.
Following more walking, a pot of earl grey tea was enjoyed (alongside some locally baked pastries) in a charming cafe in the fork of Gothic road.
The Gothic region, and the plaza Rela in particular, is a real diamond in the crown of the sprawling alleyways of Barca.
Elaborately crafted window sills, lined with palm trees and gold leafed figureheads brought a touch of regalness to a public square.
As evening drew and the Sun sank ever lower and closer to the sea, we took a short taxi ride towards a mountainside boulevard. Restaurant Martinez awaited…
A meal of sol-fish, grilled aubergine and a refreshing Spanish white was finished with a Catalonia creme brûlée and a quick macchiato on the moonlight terrace.
The iconic glow of the Martinez neon sign trickled onto the seated patio, as the first day in Barcelona drew to a close.
— — A tale of much Tapas — —
The second day of our Barcelona adventure brought a slower pace after the manic rush following landing.
We rose slowly at the boutique and bohemian styled Ofelias Hotel. After enjoying the waterfall shower, we took the glass exposed elevator to the fifth floor, where a slimly discreet terrace pool sat tranquilly under the morning sun.
Hotel Ofelias is located just off plaza Espanya, it’s black awnings cut an abrasive shade over the sidewalk and two large potted plants keep guard on each side of the door.
A gold wrought iron handle signals to pull and inside the lobby, cushioned armchairs, marble floors and floral wallpapers provide a unique but luxurious decor.
The rooms are simple but well designed, a contemporary luxury with a distinctly bohemian feel. A large terrace provides a courtyard to lounge and relax in, the sun certainly had us smiling.
My fiancee Hope particularly enjoyed the sun trap terrace, with its cushioned lounger and small dining table; an ideal spot for an evening glass of wine.
The rooftop terrace pool was bitterly cold but crystal blue and exhilaratingly refreshing. The sun soaked wooden cladding offered a warm recovery from the waters frosty bite. Nevertheless, a cold swim is a great way to start any day in Barcelona.
After the short swim, it was time for lunch. A short walk from Espanya, is a very good independent coffeehouse — Morrow.
Morrow is a typical new wave coffee joint — artisan pastries, organic coffee and minimalist design; a true sign that Barcelona is certainly no museum city but a living and thriving location for the young and prosperous.
Morrow’s sleek interior design, array of artisan sandwiches, fresh coffee and skilled Catalonian baristas make it an obvious choice for a quick break.
A short conversation with the Morrow owners revealed that the coffeehouse is New Zealand inspired, like many of our favourite coffee haunts back in London.
Following a quick lunch of Fauta (thinly sliced sandwich with cured meat), coffee and pastries, in Morrow; we ventured back northwards into Barcelona to see the world famous Sagrada Familia.
Despite its obvious beauty, the Familia cathedral appeared to be under some heavy restoration work; so we didn’t experience it at its finest.
But the Gaudi architecture is really quite something, it’s curves, shapes and edges so clearly inspired by a living, breathing God muse that it’s no wonder that Gaudi is often dubbed as God’s architect.
We enjoyed wonderful ice cream in front of the Sagrada at an independent store called Farggi.
A short walk from Sagrada, through the quieter Gracia district, led to the Gothic Quarter, where we enjoyed a moment drinking short lagers from a chilled press. Lunch was enjoyed on the backstreet lawns of a college campus.
We then took the L3 metro, as the sun was setting, to the wonderfully authentic Bar Canete. A world renowned tapas location…
Here, the waiters fly around yelling impassioned Spanish; golden goblets of freshly drafted Estrella fly around on silver platters, plumes of steam fill the kitchen as clams are steamed; and micro dishes of endless wonderful delicacies are enjoyed by a marvelling crowd.
A truly special spot for dinner and a real must visit on the Barcelona check list…
— — A face sized beer — —
The final day and the sun was still shining. Barcelona in April brings a glorious warmth, not hot and sticky but a gentle and constant shine that fills you with boundless energy and endless optimism.
It’s a delight to simply sit on the warm concrete of the hotel steps, breathing in the Spanish air and reflecting on the past two days.
Another coffee at Morrow. Irresistible. Their sleekly designed paper cups with the black label make for a good snap…
With our departure time looming, we paid a quick visit to the Barcelona beach front.
A busier and more touristy part of town but nonetheless picturesque. The beach front is dotted with hundreds of small bistros, bars and grills; offering food and drinks on the harbour front.
We finished off the day with drinks at Tapa Tapa, where the beers are ridiculously big.
The final metro journey of the weekend took us back to the Plazza Espanya, where we jumped on the A1 bus to the Barcelona Airport.
Gracias, Barcelona!"

As I explored in my assessment of Barcelona’s recent victory over Sevilla, there are signs that Xavi Hernández is doing more than just getting good results. He’s moulding a very accomplished footballing system.
But recently, not everything has been rosy in the era of #XaviBall. After a laborious draw against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, and a narrow victory against Levante that Barca had no right to win, it’s clear that the side is still in its juvenile phase at best.
In particular, it’s suffered against a specific shape and play style. After some analysis, it appears no coincidence that Barca struggles when the opposition plays five defenders.
So having watched some games back, with a keen eye on the tactical nuances, I’ve listed a few key reasons why 5 is an unlucky number for Xavi’s Barcelona.
1.The numerical advantage is lost in buildup
Building up from the goalkeeper, Barcelona have consistently used a 2–3–5 setup. Both full backs go wide, the attacking midfielders are high up the pitch, and the wingers stay wide on either flank. The goal is to make the pitch big, stretch the opposition, and ultimately create space in the wide areas.
Because of the positions of the attacking midfielders, the opposing back four must stay compact. By moving the ball from side to side, Barca can easily find a full back or winger with plenty of space.
And with the centre forward occupying two centre backs, Barca have a free man when the opponents press aggressively.
A back five changes everything
However, when the opposition plays a back five, or three, the man advantage is lost. All of the front players are man-marked, plus the attacking midfielders. Here against Levante, you can see every player, bar the keeper, is accounted for.
Eintracht Frankfurt used a similar idea. But instead of man marking everywhere, they conceded the numerical advantage in the first third of the pitch in order to create their own advantage in the zone Barca loves to attack most: out wide.
The consistent problem here is that the back line cannot be stretched.
With five players defending, both wingers can be marked tightly regardless of where the ball is. No matter how much Barca move the ball looking for space, it will very rarely appear on the flanks.
So how should Barca play out from these scenarios? The answer leads us on to the next problem.
2. Barca’s forwards struggle to hold up the ball
When passing lanes are blocked and the wide players are marked, the emphasis must shift to the centre of the pitch. The most direct solution is to use a ‘third man run’.
This means finding the attacking midfielders indirectly, by going through the centre forward.
The image above is the ideal scenario. Aubameyang makes a run deep and has Pedri in support, who has also peeled off his marker — one of the centre backs. This is the benefit of having the attacking midfielders high and wide.
The theory is easy, the execution not so much. And Aubameyang has been having a torrid time recently trying to hold the ball up.
Unfortunately, neither Dembélé or Ferran Torres are particularly adept at doing this either (á la Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane). This makes a man-for-man approach very appealing for the opposition.
To summarise so far: a back five nullifies Plan A (to create space out wide), and forces Plan B (go direct into the forwards), which simply hasn’t been fruitful. And perhaps not suited to the current personnel.
So what’s Plan C? Well, here’s the third problem:
3. The system is too rigid
Or, in other words, there is no Plan C. And that’s understandable.
Xavi has modernised the way Barcelona play. It’s not an understatement, after the mediocrity of several managers (that won’t be named), to say that players have had to ‘re-learn’ the game. At least with regards to understanding positioning and movement.
With that in mind, and with the players taking on a new system, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they haven’t yet mastered the next stage: improvisation.
Because improvisation is key when Plan A and B don’t work. That, and a lot of quality.
I’m talking particularly about fluidity of role and movement. Manchester City are the kings of this. Despite having a very defined idea of how to attack, the players interchange positions and responsibilities effortlessly.
We got a glimpse of this in the second half against Levante, as Gavi and Pedri came on and introduced an element of unpredictability. Especially the former, who did something no other midfielder had even attempted: dribble past his marker.
This characteristic, fluidity, should quite naturally mature and evolve with time. It’s reasonable that this is a work in progress.
However, my final point is perhaps more concerning. Especially in the face of some big games before the end of the season:
4. Nobody is marking the wingbacks
If there’s one flaw that everyone has realised, it’s that Barca’s biggest weakness is their defensive transition.
Two of the reasons for this have been touched on already:
The first: the loss of possession through the centre forward. With wingers high and wide, and attacking midfielders supporting, Barca can be very short on numbers in transition. Busquets and Pique become especially exposed due to their lack of pace.
The second: Jordi Alba drifts wide. Usually, Barcelona try to prevent counter-attacks with a 2–3 shape that remains behind the ball. But when Jordi Alba, the leftmost of the ‘3’ breaks beyond the ball, this shape is broken and opposing forwards exploit the space.
The third reason is specific to the five-man backline. You can see it materialising in the image above, in the bottom right corner of the image. It’s the opposition wingback.
Against Frankfurt especially, it was clear Barca’s wingers were not instructed to track back. With the entire backline occupied by forwards, these marauding wingbacks created overloads time and again.
It was the same story against Levante, who should have made much more of their numerous overloads.
And so while Barcelona and Xavi have spent much of these first few months tweaking the offensive setup, more caution will need to be paid to this type of counter attack. Fortunately, the tactical solution seems easy enough: players work harder to get back.
Whether anything more can be done about it (aside from making tactical fouls) remains to be seen.
Despite everything I’ve highlighted, things still look overwhelmingly positive for Barcelona. The speed in which Xavi has implemented his system, and the players have understood it, is credit to his coaching ability.
However, this project is still a work-in-progress. Come the summer, personnel will change, the squad will look different, and things will evolve again. Whether Xavi can fix these problems problems immediately will be a big test of his managerial prowess. But based on his record so far, I wouldn’t bet against him.

Greetings, football enthusiasts! Today, I’m taking you on a timeless journey through one of FC Barcelona’s unforgettable nights. Join me to discover the magic that unfolded in the clash against Chelsea (2009), a night engraved in the annals of football history.
“Each second felt like an eternity”
The story begins in a hub of pure excitement. Chelsea already led 1-0, and Barça faced a mountain to climb. At that time, as a 12-year-old schoolboy, I returned from school with indescribable excitement. I couldn’t wait to see how my heroes would tackle this colossal challenge.
I remember sticking to the TV, still wearing my school uniform, eagerly anticipating the spectacle. It was more than just a match for me; it was an immersive experience, a magical interlude in my adolescence.
As the match progressed, stress mounted. Every whistle, every pause in play, everything seemed to decide Barça’s fate. My heart raced; each second felt like an eternity.
Then came the 93rd minute, a moment etched in my mind. Andrés Iniesta, the football genius, triggered an explosion of emotions. I remember leaping with joy, unable to contain the excitement. It was a moment of deliverance, where football transcended the sport to become a pure emotional experience.
Let’s be honest—beyond the scoreboard, there were refereeing decisions that could have altered the narrative. As a fan, I couldn’t help but acknowledge the whims of fate. Football, with its imperfections, added to the drama of that unforgettable night.
Ultimately, beyond the scoreboard, it was a fan’s journey—a roller coaster of emotions, from doubt to belief, from anxiety to jubilation. Join me next time to relive other unforgettable football moments.
Don’t forget to subscribe, and share your own stories in the comments. Until next time, keep the football spirit alive!
This is Stanley,

Barcelona was never on my radar as a place to visit, let alone move to. In 2024, nearly 12 million tourists visited this city, which is now my home. After four and a half years as a resident, I’ve seen its good and its bad, but moving here has still been my best big life decision, and I’ve made more than my fair share of bad ones.
Before you question, “I wonder what it’s like to be an American expat living in Barcelona,” let me make something perfectly clear. I identify as an immigrant. Expats, in my opinion, have large sums of disposable income, something I do not have.
My decision to move here had nothing to do with its beautiful architecture, fabulous food, and comfortable climate. I moved here because, while visiting Tuva, a small Siberian republic in the Russian Federation that shares a border with Mongolia, for a third time, I met a woman there who happened to live in Barcelona. What started as a friendship turned into a romance, and after several visits to see her, I took the dive into the deep end of the pool and eventually moved here permanently.
Anything worth doing usually has a few bumps in the road, and my decision to move to Barcelona was hit with a huge one. Three days before my flight from New York to Barcelona, the pandemic shut the world’s borders…

How I Learned to Blend in With Locals in Barcelona: Tips from a Grateful Foreigner,https://medium.com/@ntrntlf/how-i-learned-to-blend-in-with-locals-in-barcelona-tips-from-a-grateful-foreigner-1b506ab6472f,"Sign up

When I first arrived in Barcelona, I was wide-eyed and clumsy — like a tourist trying too hard not to look like one. I’d been dreaming of Gaudí facades, sangria by the beach, and a Mediterranean lifestyle full of late dinners and even later conversations. What I didn’t anticipate was how long it would take to actually feel like I belonged.
Here’s what I learned — sometimes the hard way — about blending in with locals in this magnetic, complex city.
1. Start with “Bon dia,” not “Hola”
I knew Spanish (Castellano), but I quickly discovered that Catalan is everywhere — on street signs, in supermarkets, and yes, in everyday greetings. Saying bon dia (good morning) instead of hola showed respect for the local culture. No one expected me to be fluent in Catalan, but trying a few words — si us plau (please), gràcies (thank you) — opened a lot of doors, literally and figuratively.
Tip: Download a basic Catalan phrasebook or app. Just trying a few phrases goes a long way.
2. Eat when they eat, not when you’re hungry
I once sat down for dinner at 7:00 PM and got a confused look from the waiter. In Barcelona, lunch is at 2 PM, and dinner doesn’t start until at least 9 PM. Adapting to this schedule was challenging at first (especially with my American stomach), but it helped me sync with the rhythm of the city.
Tip: Join the menú del día (menu of the day) crowd at lunchtime. It’s affordable, filling, and a great way to observe locals in their natural habitat.
3. Dress the part, subtly
Barcelona style is chic but effortless. Locals somehow make sneakers look elegant and never seem overdressed or underdressed. I learned the hard way when I showed up to a casual dinner in flip-flops and got side-eyes from every direction.
Tip: Leave the touristy sandals and loud prints at home. A well-fitted tee, stylish sneakers, and a light jacket can help you blend in instantly.
4. Embrace vermouth culture
I didn’t expect vermouth to become part of my weekend ritual, but “fer el vermut” (having a vermouth) before lunch on weekends is a sacred tradition. It’s not about getting tipsy — it’s about slowing down, snacking on olives, and chatting with friends for hours.
Tip: Go to a neighborhood bodega on a Sunday around noon. Order a vermut negre and some anchovies. Just sit, sip, and soak it in.
5. Avoid La Rambla — except at 5 a.m.
Everyone goes to La Rambla once. But locals? They avoid it like the plague — unless they’re walking home after a night out. If you want to see the real Barcelona, head to neighborhoods like Gràcia, Sant Antoni, or Poblenou.
Tip: Wander into the smaller plazas at night. You’ll find kids playing soccer, couples drinking wine on benches, and old men arguing about Barça. That’s the magic.
6. Be a regular
One of the best decisions I made was committing to a local café. I went every day, even if it was just for a cortado. Eventually, the barista started greeting me by name, and I was invited to a neighborhood calçotada (a Catalan barbecue). That’s when I knew I was more than just a visitor.
Tip: Pick a small bar, café, or shop near where you live. Consistency breeds community.
7. Understand the pride — and pain — of Catalan identity
Conversations about identity, politics, and language run deep here. I learned early on not to assume Spain = Catalonia. People here have a distinct sense of self, and respecting that nuance showed I wasn’t just another tourist trying to “do Spain in a week.”
Tip: Listen more than you talk. Ask questions, and stay curious. You’ll gain trust.
Final Thoughts
Blending in doesn’t mean pretending to be local — it means respecting the flow, showing genuine interest, and participating instead of spectating. Barcelona rewards patience and presence. It taught me to slow down, look around, and become part of the scenery.
I came to Barcelona with a suitcase and a guidebook. I stayed because of the people who welcomed me when I finally stopped trying so hard — and just started being.

As an avid traveller, I’m always searching for the heart of a city, that unique pulse that goes beyond the typical tourist trail. In Barcelona, I found it not just in the architectural wonders, but within the hallowed walls of Camp Nou.
While I didn’t get to witness the electrifying energy of a live match, the tour of FC Barcelona’s legendary stadium was an experience in itself. From the moment I approached the colossal structure, I felt the weight of football history. Camp Nou isn’t just a stadium its mesmerising almost feeling hypnotised.
Walking through the stadium, I could almost hear the echoes of roaring crowds and the legendary players who graced that pitch. The sheer scale of the place is breath taking. Standing on the side lines, imagining the thrill of a packed stadium, gave me goose bumps. Visiting the changing rooms, walking through the tunnel the players use, and seeing the press box all provided a unique perspective.
The museum offered a fascinating glimpse into the club’s rich history, showcasing trophies, iconic jerseys, and the stories behind Barcelona’s greatest moments. It’s a testament to the club’s legacy and its deep connection to the city.
Even without a match, Camp Nou vibrated with an almost palpable energy. It’s a place where passion and history collide. To top it all off, the tour concluded with a truly immersive 360-degree cinematic experience ( link at the top of this article make sure to watch it), putting me right in the heart of the action with all the legendary players. It was an incredible way to feel the pulse of the team. This entire experience gave me a deeper understanding of Barcelona, a city where football is more than just a sport; it’s an integral part of the culture.
So, if you’re visiting Barcelona, make sure to add Camp Nou to your itinerary. Whether you’re a die-hard football fan or simply curious, a tour of this iconic stadium is an unforgettable experience. It’s a chance to connect with the soul of the city and understand why football is so much more than just a game.
A trip you need to definitely add to your bucket list!

Barcelona is a city I visited without many expectations, but I saw how wrong I was. Before the trip, my knowledge was limited only something such as urban planning, building structures, big Gaudi’s structures, football club and generic things. But after spending three days there, I felt like I could actually live in Barcelona.
I want to share my experience and what I learned when I walked through the city. There are still some places I couldn’t visit; unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time. In this writing, I shared only some places that I went.
First, I gave a 3-day trip itinerary. Then, I explained each place in detail, organized by category.
Start your journey in the heart of the old city, dive into Gothic architecture.
Explore the green side of Barcelona with views, art, and calm spaces, plus a beautiful evening at the beach.
Today is all about imagination, emotion, and big symbols of Barcelona’s identity.
I organized my trip into the following categories:
🏰 Historical & Architectural Landmarks
1.Baslica de la Sagrada Famlia
The Basílica de la Sagrada Família is one of the most iconic landmarks in Barcelona and the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world. Designed by Antoni Gaudí, it looks like something out of a fairytale with its towering spires and intricate facades. Construction began back in 1882 and is still ongoing today.
Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect born in 1852 in Catalonia. He studied architecture in Barcelona and became known for his innovative use of materials and structures. Gaudí worked on several major projects, including Park Güell, Casa Batlló, and the Sagrada Família, which he focused on from 1883 until his death in 1926.
Gaudí didn’t start the Sagrada Família project himself — it was already planned as a Catholic church by a local organization called the Spiritual Association of Devotees of Saint Joseph. They wanted to build a church dedicated to the Holy Family (Sagrada Família) to promote Christian values in response to the rise of secularism.
Gaudí took over the project in 1883, after the original architect resigned. He saw it as a chance to combine his deep Catholic faith with architecture. For Gaudí, the church wasn’t just a building — it was a way to tell the story of Christianity through art, structure, and symbolism. He dedicated the last 40 years of his life to it, turning it into his life’s mission.
If you want to see the inside, it’s best to buy your ticket at least a week in advance.
2. Baslica de Santa Maria del Mar
The Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar is a beautiful Gothic church built in the 1300s by local sailors and merchants. It feels peaceful and grand inside, with tall stone columns and soft natural light. Tucked in the heart of El Born, it’s a quiet gem full of history and charm.
3. Baslica de Santa Maria del Pi
The Basílica de Santa Maria del Pi was built in the early 1300s and finished around 1391. It’s a quiet Gothic church in the middle of the old town, named after a pine tree that once grew nearby. With its tall bell tower and simple stone walls, it’s a peaceful place to rest and enjoy a bit of history.
Both churches were built in the 1300s and look Gothic, but they feel different inside. Santa Maria del Mar is brighter and more open, while Santa Maria del Pi feels stronger and a bit darker.
4. Cathedral of Barcelona
The Cathedral of Barcelona, also called the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia, was built between the 13th and 15th centuries. It’s a grand Gothic church with tall spires, stone carvings, and a peaceful cloister inside. Right outside is Plaça de la Seu, a lovely square where people often sit, watch street performers, or take photos of the cathedral’s front.
5. Palau Reial Major
The Palau Reial Major was the royal palace of the counts of Barcelona and later the kings of Aragon. It was mainly built between the 13th and 15th centuries and sits in the Gothic Quarter. Today, you can explore its old stone halls and the Plaça del Rei in front, a quiet square that feels full of medieval history.
In this narrow area, I felt a deeper connection to history.
6. Palau de la Generalitat
The Palau de la Generalitat is the seat of the Catalan government and has been used for that purpose since the 1400s. It has a mix of Gothic and Renaissance styles and is still a working government building today. You’ll find it on Plaça de Sant Jaume, right across from the City Hall.
In the square in front of this building we saw an old man talking about how much damage tourists were doing to Barcelona.
We saw a “tourists go home” protest in Barcelona. However, a touristic environment was created throughout the city and apart from this person, I did not see any attitude towards tourists; on the contrary, everyone was very interested.
7. Barcelona City Hall
Barcelona City Hall, also known as Casa de la Ciutat, has been the city’s main government building since the 14th century. Its front mixes Gothic and Neoclassical styles, showing how the city changed over time. It faces the Palau de la Generalitat on Plaça de Sant Jaume, a square full of history and political life.
8. Casa Batlló
Casa Batlló is one of Antoni Gaudí’s most famous works, designed in 1904. The building looks like something from a dream, with colorful tiles, flowing shapes, and a roof that looks like a dragon’s back. It’s on Passeig de Gràcia and often called the “House of Bones” because of its bone-like balconies and windows.
9. La Pedrera — Casa Milà
La Pedrera, also known as Casa Milà, was designed by Antoni Gaudí and finished in 1912. Its wavy stone façade and twisted iron balconies make it look like a moving piece of art. The rooftop, with its strange chimney shapes, is one of the most unique spots in Barcelona.
As I saw these works of Gaudi, they changed my perception a lot as they differed from other works of art.
10. Monument als Castellers
The Monument als Castellers represents the traditional Catalan practice of building human towers, called castells. These towers are made by people standing on each other’s shoulders, sometimes reaching up to 10 levels high. The sculpture shows the strength, teamwork, and trust needed to create these towers — core values of Catalan culture.
11. The World Comes To Life With Each Kiss
The mural “The World Begins With Every Kiss” (El món neix en cada besada) symbolizes love, freedom, and unity. Created in 2014 by photographer Joan Fontcuberta and ceramist Antoni Cumella, it commemorates the 300th anniversary of Barcelona’s fall during the War of the Spanish Succession. The artwork comprises 4,000 ceramic tiles, each featuring photographs submitted by citizens depicting personal moments of freedom. Together, these images form a mosaic of two people kissing, representing the enduring spirit of love and resilience in the face of adversity.
A nice area to take photos.
12. Camp Nou
The Camp Nou is FC Barcelona’s iconic stadium, originally opened on September 24, 1957. Camp Nou, FC Barcelona’s iconic stadium, is currently undergoing major renovations to expand its capacity to 105,000 and modernize its facilities.
I think they design great museums to introduce their teams. Additionally, it was amazing to see the Champions League trophy with my own eyes.
🏞️ Parks, Viewpoints & Nature
13. Montjuc & Montjuïc Castle
Montjuïc became a key part of Barcelona’s growth and global image in the 20th century. Many of its buildings and spaces were first developed for the 1929 International Exposition, a world fair that helped show off the city’s culture and progress. Later, in 1992, the area was transformed again to host the Summer Olympic Games, bringing new life to old buildings and adding new sports facilities.
Today, Montjuïc is a mix of history, art, and nature. You can visit the Montjuïc Castle, explore museums like the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC), walk through peaceful gardens, or watch the light show at the Magic Fountain. It’s a place where locals and visitors come to relax, learn, and enjoy some of the best views in the city.
14. Plaça de les Cascades
Plaça de les Cascades is a beautiful square in Barcelona, located just below the National Art Museum of Catalonia on Montjuïc Hill. Built for the 1929 International Exposition, it features a series of cascading fountains that lead up to the museum, creating a stunning visual effect. The square is a popular spot for visitors to relax and enjoy the views of the city.
15. Ciutadella Park
Ciutadella Park is one of the most loved green spaces in Barcelona, perfect for relaxing, walking, or enjoying a boat ride on the lake. It was once a military area but turned into a public park in the 1800s. On weekends, the park comes alive with events, music, and people dancing near the big fountain.
It easily ranks in my top 5 favorites.
16. Park Güell
Park Güell is a colourful and imaginative park designed by Antoni Gaudí, built between 1900 and 1914. Originally planned as a housing development, it became a public park filled with winding paths, mosaic-covered benches, and playful architecture. Today, it’s one of Barcelona’s most iconic spots and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It costs 18 euros, but totally worth it.
17. Barceloneta Beach — Playa de la Barceloneta
Barceloneta Beach is one of Barcelona’s most famous and lively beaches, located in the old fishing neighborhood of La Barceloneta. It was transformed in the early 1990s for the Olympic Games, turning into a wide, sandy beach with a long promenade. Today, it’s a favorite spot for sunbathing, swimming, beach volleyball, and enjoying fresh seafood at the nearby chiringuitos. The beach is also known for its vibrant atmosphere, with street performers, music, and people dancing along the promenade, especially in the evenings.
PERFECT!!!
It was full even though we didn’t go swimming. I can’t imagine summer.
🖼️ Museums & Cultural Sites
18. Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya
The Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC) was built for the 1929 International Exposition to show off Catalan culture and art. It’s located in the Palau Nacional on Montjuïc Hill, a grand building that became the perfect home for a national museum. Today, it holds one of the best collections of Romanesque art in the world, along with Gothic, Renaissance, and modern works.
⛲ Monuments & Squares
19. Plaça d’Espanya
Plaça d’Espanya is one of Barcelona’s largest and most important squares, built in 1929 for the International Exposition. It was designed to impress visitors and serve as a grand entrance to Montjuïc, connecting major roads like Gran Via and Avinguda del Paral·lel.
20. Plaça de Catalunya
Plaça de Catalunya is the central square of Barcelona, connecting the old city with the modern Eixample district. Inaugurated in 1927, it covers 5 hectares and serves as a major hub for transport, shopping, and city life. Surrounded by shops, cafes, and fountains, it’s a popular meeting point for both locals and visitors.
21. Plaça Reial
Plaça Reial is a lively square in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, just off La Rambla. Built in the mid-1800s on the site of a former convent, it was designed to honor the monarchy. The square features palm trees, elegant arches, and a central fountain called the Three Graces. Notably, the ornate lampposts were among Antoni Gaudí’s first public works. Today, Plaça Reial is a popular spot for dining, nightlife, and enjoying open-air events.
If you are looking for a nice place to eat, I recommend this place.
22. Plaça de la Vila de Madrid
Plaça de la Vila de Madrid is a peaceful square in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, known for its hidden Roman cemetery. In the 1950s, during construction, archaeologists uncovered 85 Roman tombs dating from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. These graves belonged mostly to ordinary people — freedmen, slaves, and lower-class citizens — who were buried along a road leading out of the ancient Roman city of Barcino. Today, visitors can view the tombs from a raised walkway and learn more at the small museum on site.
23. Arc de Triomf
The Arc de Triomf is a big red-brick arch built in 1888 for a world fair held in Barcelona. It wasn’t made for war, but to welcome people from around the world. Today, it’s a popular place to walk, take photos, and enjoy the wide promenade that leads to Ciutadella Park.
🛍️ Markets & Shopping Streets
24. Mercat de la Boqueria
La Boqueria Market is Barcelona’s most famous food market, found right on La Rambla. It started way back in the 1200s and became a proper market in the 1800s. Today, you can walk through colorful stalls, try local street food, fresh fruit, and even grab some tasty tapas.
25. La Rambla
La Rambla is a famous street in the center of Barcelona, running from Plaça de Catalunya down to the sea. It’s always full of life, with street performers, small shops, cafés, and flower stands. It’s a fun place to walk, grab a snack, and feel the city’s energy.
🚡 Rides & Attractions
26. Telefric de Montjuc
The Telefèric de Montjuïc is a scenic cable car ride in Barcelona that takes you from Montjuïc Park up to Montjuïc Castle. Opened in 1970 and upgraded in 2007, it offers panoramic views of the city and the sea. The ride has three stops: Parc de Montjuïc, Mirador, and Castell.
27. Transportation Tickets
🍽️ Food & Drink Spots

A fun place to grab flavorful, creative tacos with a twist. A cool mix of Mexican street food and Barcelona’s chill vibe.
30. El Tastet de l’Artur
A cozy, local eatery known for authentic Catalan dishes. It’s a hidden gem where you can enjoy a more traditional, homemade meal.

When we talk about football clubs, Spanish football clubs, especially FC Barcelona, come to mind. FC Barcelona has emerged as one of the biggest and most renowned football clubs in the world. Let’s take a journey into the development of FC Barcelona and how they have continuously adapted to the demands of the times.
FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by Joan Gamper and has since become an important part of Barcelona’s culture and history. FC Barcelona shares a strong connection with Catalonia, as it has emerged as a rallying point for Catalan identity, providing a platform for the expression of Catalan aspirations. The club’s motto, “Mes que un club” (More than a club), reflects its social, cultural, and political impact. This identity has evolved over time, solidifying the club as a symbol of resistance and Catalan identity.
One of the most visible aspects of FC Barcelona is their playing style. They embrace a philosophy of beautiful football and ball dominance, known as “tiki-taka.” This style of play is a developed and perfected version of “Total Football” popularized by former Barcelona manager, Johan Cruyff. Cruyff’s influence and tactical approach laid the foundation of FC Barcelona’s philosophy.
Later, under the guidance of coaches Louis van Gaal and especially Pep Guardiola, FC Barcelona refined and implemented the tiki-taka style to its fullest potential. Guardiola played a significant role in promoting and developing “tiki-taka” during his successful tenure as Barcelona’s head coach from 2008 to 2012, collecting 14 major trophies.
The development of FC Barcelona is not limited to their playing style. They have also strengthened their youth player development structure and established the renowned football academy, La Masia. In recent years, Barcelona has also enhanced their approach to using technology and data analysis to improve team performance. They are currently renovating their stadium, now called Spotify Camp Nou.
FC Barcelona’s development is also reflected in their history of success. The club has won numerous domestic and international titles, including La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. They have had star players like Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, and many more who have become symbols of Barcelona’s dominance.
FC Barcelona has undergone a remarkable evolution over time, both in terms of playing style and as a social institution. The combination of visionary coaching, skilled players, and a commitment to the club’s philosophy led to the mastery of tiki-taka at Barcelona. They continuously adapt to the changing times and follow the path of remarkable development. FC Barcelona is not just a football club; it is a symbol of spirit, identity, and values that define them, just like their motto, “Mes Que Un Club” (More Than a Club).

TL;DR💛 ProsUpcoming tech and product communityVibrant cityEasy to live day-to-day life without learning the language
🚧 ConsSalaries lower than other European citiesLots of paperwork for visa/residency in SpanishFlat-hunt can be a challenge
If you are up for reading the long part, we have🤔 Why Barcelona💬 Interview Process📑 Spain Visa🏦 Working in N26🏠 Flat-scene & Utility Bills🥘 Food💸 Budget☎️ Language👯‍♀️ Friends and Indian Community💔 Pandemic☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona
If you followed along, I had decided quite early I wanted to rent a studio apartment in Paris and live there as an adult. After graduation, and while working in Bangalore, I was looking for reasons to travel or move abroad as my weekend side project.
With my experience and profile, I figured I should diversify my options. So I applied to a lot of places for jobs — Ottawa, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, New York (yes yes I know how impossible the US visa situation is!). I was pretty much open to any city for the experience!
I had applied to an N26 opening that had Berlin/Barcelona/Vienna mentioned. During one of the interviews, the recruiter mentioned I was being considered for the Barcelona office.
Recruiter: “So what do you think Chhavi?”
The open-source community I contributed to back in college, had roots in Barcelona. I had visited Barcelona before twice and had absolutely loved it. I had tagged it as “my city” pretty much on the first visit. I was always super grateful to be in Barcelona, but never thought I could ever live there. It just never crossed my mind.🙃
The recruiter stared back at me through the zoom call.
Me: “I love Barcelona!”
A friend of a friend used N26, and he mentioned it to me. Mobile banks were still a new concept to me, so I did a little bit of research. A quick Google search listed all of these fin-tech darlings — Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26.
I found a mutual on LinkedIn and requested a referral. I saw on LinkedIn that they had a few folks from India, so I thought maybe…maybe they do sponsor visas. Long haul, but worth a shot. I waited for a bit and heard back from a recruiter 2–3 weeks later.
I was super excited to make it to the interviews. The “funnel” is so dramatic when you apply abroad — that this feels like an achievement. First I ordered and ate a lot of ice cream through Swiggy. Then I spent a lot of time preparing. More on this in part 1.
chhavii.medium.com
1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.2. Design Exercise. I was asked to design a mobile application for reading curated books.3. Video-call to discuss the Design Exercise. My first chance to interacting with product designers on the team. We talked about the exercise, about the team, and in general how I could contribute.4.Video-call with a Product Manager and a Product Designer. Here we talked more about product thinking, our take on MVPs, using data, making trade-offs, and working as a cross-functional team. 5. Video-call with Head of Design. We talked about my career aspirations, how they see the team growing, how I could contribute, and on giving back to the design community and making the product more inclusive.
1. N26 was looking for someone with my level of experience. Most of the times it’s not you. It’s just about what the team needs right now.
2. N26 was building a truly international company, hence was open to sponsoring visas.
3. The extra effort I had put to balance out my years of experience — I had prepared an analysis of the N26 app, and the ways I could contribute to the team.
The whole process felt pretty organic and I think took around a month. The part that was the biggest selling point for me was the people I talked with. I found all of them super respectful, and great listeners. We talked a lot about how they see the team growing, and how I could add to it. In hindsight, these conversations were such a strong indicator of why the team would be perfect for what I was looking for!
My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!
It wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.
My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.
N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.
The process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.
I had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.
Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!
Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️
On workWe worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.
It was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.
I also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.
The office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!
On design teamWe call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.
We had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.
Honestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.
Side note: I will share some more pictures on my Instagram stories here.
This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃
You cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.
Barcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.
My first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).
I had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.
I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩
At one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳
We could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.
It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀
Again, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the Menu del Dia — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!
I also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s ras malai.
It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂
A rough breakdown of my monthly budgetRent — 650 EurosUtility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)Groceries — 200ishTransport — 50ishTravel (pre-covid) — 400ish
Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!
I took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.
Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.
I had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)
I am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!
It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.
I remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.
I was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.
I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.
Even though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.
I sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.
I would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!

A personal reflection on the unexpected, hours-long power outage that left Spain and parts of two other countries in the dark.
It’s been four days since the blackout. Though I took plenty of notes on the day itself, it wasn’t until I read someone else’s reflection that I felt moved to write my own.
It all began around 10:30 a.m. I’d just finished a call with two teammates, where we broke down a large epic into smaller user stories for the next day’s refinement session. That meeting had been one of my main focuses — finalizing those stories would free up my time later in the week while the development team started the development of those tasks.
The night before, a quiet Sunday, I’d gone to bed early. Lying there, I mentally outlined my week. Writing those stories was at the top of my Monday to-do list. So, after the meeting, I grabbed my draft notes and a glass of water, ready for a deep-focus session. But Jira wasn’t updating. My Wi-Fi had disconnected. Odd, but not entirely unusual, as my home connection can be temperamental.
I went to the kitchen. The room felt strangely dark, so I reached for the light switch. Nothing. That’s when I realised the electricity was out.
Our neighbour has been doing construction work for months, so my first assumption was that they’d accidentally cut a line. I stepped outside and asked,“Excuse me, I noticed I have no electricity. Are you working on anything that might’ve caused it?”“It’s not just you,” he said. “The whole street’s out.”
Strange. A few months back, a nearby building caught fire, and we briefly lost power, but this felt different. I still had mobile data, so I messaged my team to let them know I was offline trying to figure it out what was going home with power at home. One colleague replied, saying he’d also lost power, and he lives far from me. I wrote back:“Hey, is this happening across Barcelona?”He responded: “I have friends in Badalona and Madrid going through the same.”
Just then, my partner arrived from the gym. Before I could say anything, he told me he’d stopped by the supermarket but couldn’t buy anything, no electricity, no card payments.
My thoughts began racing. Was this just local? A regional outage? I checked the news: barely two or three headlines. No one knew the cause yet.
I decided to stay calm and wait for a few more minutes. I was constantly checking the WiFi to see if there were any chances of it being back yet.
I tried calling a friend. The connection was poor, but her voice crackled through:“It’s horrible, isn’t it? I can’t hear you well.” She mentioned GPS was still working, so she was heading home, adjusting to her new commute after recently moving.
She was okay but had to hang up, her husband was calling from Vilanova i la Geltrú. That made me pause. A colleague had mentioned Madrid, but the news hadn’t confirmed anything. If her husband in Vilanova was calling about the blackout, this wouldn’t normalise in only a few minutes, it was spreading. Or already had.
I checked in with my partner. He seemed calm, which made me second-guess my own growing anxiety. I appreciated his steadiness, but the total lack of urgency worried me too. He began messaging friends using mobile data. Some confirmed that France wasn’t affected, but Sitges was also out. Could this be a cyberattack?
By now, I’d lost mobile signal entirely.
I opened the fridge: bare. We had enough leftover for maybe a day. Living in the city center, we usually buy fresh groceries daily. No need to stockpile.
My partner saw the look on my face and began filling some water bottles. I checked our cupboards: some rice, a bit of pasta, not much more than that. Thankfully, we had a gas cooktop. I rummaged for cash: around €20 in a jar of travel coins, another €30 in my wallet. That would have to do.
But what to buy? Some food for today and tomorrow, of course, but besides that? What was I preparing for?
A few weeks ago, I’d bought a pack of 100 candles for my night routines, reading and journaling by candlelight. At least we were set for lighting. I praised myself for that. We debated how to get updates. Would a radio be too much? Were we overreacting?
I reminded myself this wasn’t local. Multiple cities were affected. We decided to go out and see how the neighbourhood was coping.
Around 1:20 PM. We took the stairs, five flights down, in pitch black. No emergency lights. I won’t lie, that terrified me. I regretted not calling my family in Brazil before losing signal.
Outside, neighbours were talking, but no one had answers. We walked around the neighbourhood. Major supermarkets like Ametller and Caprabo were closed. Corner stores were open, with lines forming outside. People were buying toilet paper, water, radios and candles.
2:30 PM. At one building entrance, a doorman said their power was back. Ours still wasn’t. Why would some buildings have power while others didn’t? I assumed hospitals had generators, but what about regular residential buildings?
Being outside helped. I felt calmer even though the streets were not still. Public transport had stopped: the train, tram, and metro. Only buses were still running, and that’s why the lines were getting stupidly longer. People looked stressed, overchecking their phones, but frustrated with the lack of signal.
From another perspective, there were still some people sunbathing, while others drank beer on terraces. Some kind of Woodstock in the middle of an apocalypse?
We skipped the long queues and wandered further until we found a small store with no line. We bought canned beans and pasta, enough for today and tomorrow.
At the entrance, a woman was controlling how many people entered. Inside, it was dark. They were using flashlights and calculators, only accepting cash. It felt surreal.
Around 3:00 PM. We noticed a few places still had power, including a small café near Sagrada Familia, and the hospital of course. But most of the city was still out. The ATMS in our way were offline. There was a single one close to a hospital that had a huge line; we considered entering it, but decided not to; we still had a small amount of money after the groceries.
Back home, we climbed the stairs again. We had food. Water. Candles. We decided not to buy the radio, and only wait until later that night or even tomorrow. There wasn’t much more we could do.
I lay on the sofa and finally finished a book I’d started a month ago. My partner opened an old box he hadn’t touched in a year and started organising it.
Later, we talked. Made theories. What would we do in another lockdown? Would we stay in the city or move to the countryside? Buy a car? Rent first? For how long? Just possibilities. Playing out with that amount of extra time we suddenly gained for our Monday, together, in the quiet.
We cooked. We ate. It was still early.
The power had gone out at 10:30 a.m. It wouldn’t come back until nightfall. At 9:30 p.m I was in bed, calming down the nerves of that day and expecting that life would be back to normal in the morning.
I woke up at night, not exactly at what time, and noticed one light from the living was on. I didn’t do the effort to go and turn it off. Somehow it helped me to feel safe.
That day reminded me how little we control, and how much we take for granted. The ability to cook. To call loved ones. To pay for food. To know what’s happening in the world. It was all suspended.
It’s been four days since the episode. There is still no conclusions on what might have caused the European Blackout.
In the stillness of the power outage, something became clear: maybe we do need to prepare ourselves better for unknowns, not with panic, but with presence, healthy discussions, and perspective. Some things are really just out of our control. Important time to think on how we’ve been connected – or not – to the world around us.
In any case, I always knew those 100 candles would come in handy.
If you found this story meaningful or have questions about what happened that day, I’d love to hear from you. Drop a comment — I’m happy to share more.

I recently went on what should’ve been the trip of a lifetime to Barcelona (Spain) and cities Bari, Noci, Aversa, Florence, Caserta, and Naples in Italy.
Like many trips, it was full of mishaps, twists, and surprises. But I ended up learning a lot about many things, myself included, and walked away with valuable lessons and a deeper understanding of what truly matters when exploring the world and reflecting on my own life.
And don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise.
I had initially planned to visit Rome and Pompeii in Italy, but due to time constraints, my friend and I decided to explore nearby cities instead, including Caserta. We toured the Royal Palace of Caserta before catching a train to Florence. We also ventured into lesser-known cities like Bari and Noci and had the chance to experience the vibrant Carnival of Putignano during our stay.
In Barcelona, I omitted places like the Sagrada Familia from my itinerary for several reasons: I hated crowds, was terrified of being pickpocketed, and didn’t want to go just to say I went. Additionally, since it was Ramadan for us Muslims, attending Mass at the Sagrada Familia felt sacrilegious, even if it meant gaining free admission.
Instead, I immersed myself in experiences that were more meaningful to me. I spent most of my time trying out exotic fruits I couldn’t find at home, browsing local grocery stores, learning about racial demographics and local history, talking to locals in Urdu and broken Spanish, researching the Romani people (as known as Gypsies), and studying the architectural details of everyday buildings. I have a particular fixation on doors, so I snapped as many pictures of them as I could as I roamed the city.
And I was perfectly happy doing so.
This is not to say that I didn’t do touristy things. I took a paella-making class in El Raval, where I learned how to make paella, danced around the kitchen, and had enjoyable conversations with people from Moldova, Turkey, Argentina, and the US. I tried tiramisu from every cafe I could. Afterward, I oohed and aahed at paintings in the Picasso Museum, marveled at the World Culture Museum artifacts, got lost on my way to the Chocolate Museum, and pondered the different tastes of Coca-Cola in Europe and the US at a cafe. And I shopped till I dropped, with bags full of spices, magnets, postcards, keychains, and chocolates from La Rambla.
Truthfully, I did feel guilty about “wasting” my trip. The voice in my head shamed me, telling me, “What’s the point of flying all the way here if you don’t check out Park Guell and the other tourist spots?”
But I listened to my body — my anxiety — which was screaming to be heard and decided to conserve my energy for another day of exploration. Instead of pushing my feet to walk the scenic mile home at peak traffic hour, I opted for an Uber, where I enjoyed pleasant conversation with the driver and saved my aching feet from further torment.
It’s not to say I played it completely safe.
Despite being told to avoid El Raval in Barcelona, I ventured there to check out vintage clothing boutiques, satisfy my homesick cravings for Pakistani foods, and buy custard apples. On the way, I went into a Pakistani jewelry store where I bought earrings for upcoming weddings and spoke to the kind store owner in Urdu. She was more than happy to discuss her son’s engagement drama and gave me a discount and free earrings. I wandered alone in the evenings, avoiding the dark alleys and blending in with a tourist group, and enjoyed the city lights. It was a peaceful way to enjoy the city’s vibrant lights and grew my confidence in solo travel.
They say travel broadens the mind and sheds light on the true nature of friendship. During this trip, I was lucky enough to experience both.
In Naples, I reunited with my high school bestie, who went above and beyond to ensure I had the best trip possible. She planned most of our itinerary, booked us a stay at a beautiful old apartment in Noci as a surprise for me, handled our high-speed train tickets for Florence, drove me around everywhere I needed to be, and indulged my constant whims for tiramisu. When it became clear that Italian food wasn’t meant for me, we loaded up on groceries and decided to cook paella at home, where we laughed, sang, and enjoyed one another’s company as we did so.
She also offered me the best of what she had — the master bedroom in her home, her nicest jackets, and the choice of going to Rome or Florence, Bari or Materra. She didn’t want me to pay for anything, but I insisted anyway because, despite the many problems in the way I was parented, one thing I was taught was never to take advantage of anyone’s kindness.
Our parting was more bitter than sweet. Despite doing almost nothing on my travel to-do list, the permeating odor of rotting garbage on the streets, and the death-defying traffic, I had the time (and the best tiramisu) of my life in Naples, the “trash can” of Italy, and couldn’t wait to come back and explore everything else.
Fast forward to Barcelona, where nearly every interaction with my other friend was wrought with tension, resentment, and impatience.
She nitpicked everything I did and said, walked ahead without stopping to wait for me, and made it clear that she didn’t want me around. She also claimed the nice double room in our Airbnb and had me choose between two closet-sized rooms so she could use the remaining room as her closet. I put my foot down and voiced my disapproval, where she eventually relented but gave me the silent treatment for the next couple of days. Despite my initial reluctance to explore alone, I braved my fears instead of putting up with my friend’s rudeness. To socialize, I called friends and family in the US and talked to them for hours. As miserable as I felt, I was touched that many people back home were rooting for me to have a great time in Europe.
Needless to say, this “friend” and I have parted ways, and I realized how disrespected and dismissed I felt in our friendship, as well as the many insults and snide remarks I overlooked throughout our time together.
Piggybacking on my previous point, we didn’t have the nicest lodging. It was clean, in the Sant Antoni neighborhood, surrounded by many things to do. And affordable. You do pay for what you get, especially for AirBnBs.
Our AirBnB had one double room, two single rooms, and no laundry services (despite them being advertised) or microwave. Our AirBnB hosts also failed to mention that there were no elevators in the building and that the walls were very thin. The beds in our rooms were hard and we woke up with sore, stiff backs every morning. The AC unit often turned on when it wanted to and I sweated right through my bedsheets at night.
It wasn’t an entirely bad place to be. Still, I would’ve appreciated an actual dryer machine instead of relying on the unreliable solar-powered clothes dryer on the terrace. And neighbors who were less vocal in their babymaking.
In several cities across Italy and in Barcelona, I quickly became a target for street vendors who could spot me as a tourist from a mile away. At first, I indulged them, buying a few gifts for my family back home. But the problem arose when I started being followed out of shops and booths, bombarded with pleas to “buy this” and “buy that,” often accompanied by sob stories about being an immigrant in a foreign country with large families to feed.
I get it — trust me, I do. As a former people-pleaser, I understand the urge to help. Most people-pleasers are empaths who want to save the world and make life better for the less fortunate.
But let’s be clear: traveling isn’t the way to fix everything wrong with the world. Europe is full of scammers and hustlers who won’t hesitate to overcharge you for something you could easily buy for a couple of euros at the local bodega. Learn to recognize the red flags. If someone is overly pushy or offers you something “for free” on the street, respond firmly with a resounding “NO!” Don’t worry about being rude — nice people make easy targets.
If you do want to tap into your empathetic side, try supporting local small businesses rather than money-laundering souvenir shops or tourist traps. Take the time to learn about the culture around you, try exotic fruits and vegetables, and always assert your boundaries.
Travel is one of those rare situations where I genuinely appreciate my resting bitch face. If you’re a soft-spoken people-pleaser like I used to be, one of my best tips is to put on a serious resting bitch face. It may be hard if you weren’t born with one, but trust me — this facial expression helped me ward off scammers, pickpockets, and hustlers. It also made saying “no” a whole lot easier. People tend to leave you alone when they think you look like someone who won’t tolerate their bullshit.
If mastering a resting bitch face feels impossible, at least look like you know where you’re going. Project confidence. Don’t act shifty; whatever youdo, don’t pull out your GPS in the middle of a sketchy area. If you need to check your phone, step into a store and ask the shopkeeper for directions.
If you’re from a country where seasoning is a way of life, like I am, you might find most European food a bit lackluster. Your best bet is to seek out Latin American or Asian restaurants or bring your spices as you explore.
I’m a huge fan of what Americans consider Italian food. When I was in Italy, I expected the food to be mind-blowing. Instead, I was met with disappointment. I found the dishes surprisingly underseasoned, missing the bold flavors I was used to in the US. For example, the pizzas I ate felt like they were missing key ingredients — salt, dried red chili pepper, and garlic powder. The carbonara at the cute local diner was far from the creamy indulgence I knew and loved in the States. Even the curry chicken pasta tasted like it was seasoned with nothing more than a Maggi instant noodle packet. For a foodie like me, it was almost heartbreaking.
Barcelona had a much better food scene, but by then, the damage was already done.
Despite the confusion, panic, and disappointment I encountered during my trip, I still had an unforgettable time. If anything, I’d happily redo my Barcelona trip knowing what I know now. Along the way, I’ve learned to embrace spontaneity, find joy in the unexpected, and trust in the good people I know. I also learned not to question the blessings that come my way — like the $150 I saved in baggage fees thanks to the kindness of airport staff in Europe. My ability to appreciate life’s simple pleasures — like admiring doors, staircases, and the frames surrounding iconic artworks — turned out to be the perfect way to ground myself amid the chaos.

Riqui Puig was supposed to be the chosen one.
He arose from a truly desperate era for Barcelona, one of sporting failure and institutional turmoil. A squad bloated with miscalculated signings, a board involved in criminal activity, and a team utterly reliant on the powers of Lionel Messi.
And yet, despite that mayhem, Riqui emerged. And he shone brightly.
“It’s a spectacle to watch players like him play,” said former AC Milan Coach, Gennaro Gattuso. “He’s got a kid’s face, but he has football inside. It’s something I marvel at.”
He wasn’t the only one marvelling.
An academy graduate and a born Catalan, Ricard Puig Martí, ‘Riqui’, was given almost heroic status upon his ascent to the first team. Through him, it seemed written that Barcelona would recover their identity and rule the world again.
But football is cruel.
Two years later, Riqui is nowhere to be seen. Since his emergence three seasons ago, his appearances have dwindled with each successive campaign. Now, he is a footballing outcast.
What happened? Was his quality enhanced by nostalgia? His destiny purely emotional?
Putting aside all biases, I want delve into the nuances of this tale. To unravel the downfall of Riqui Puig, and explain what went wrong once and for all.
This is going to be an in-depth analysis. It isn’t a quick read. If you want to skip any sections, here is your table of contents:
Without further ado, let’s get into this story.
I have to preface this with a disclaimer. In total, at the time of writing, Riqui Puig has played a grand total of 1,539 minutes for the Barcelona first team. That’s the equivalent of just 17.1 games.
As a result, the data behind his performances is limited. The sample size is too small to draw any definitive conclusions. For the majority of this story, we’ll be relying on what we can see on the football pitch.
I will be using some data where appropriate. For example, to point out general trends and measure certain attributes over time. But it will not be a stats-heavy analysis. Nor can it be.
With that in mind, let’s talk about football.
The context behind Riqui’s appearance was of injuries, financial impotence and COVID-19.
Still technically a B team player and only 20 years old, he was called up by Quique Setién to bolster a midfield during the relentless post-covid Liga schedule.
Frenkie de Jong was injured. Arthur Melo’s sale to Juventus was incoming. Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitić were ageing, the latter of which was the only cover to Sergio Busquets.
It was necessity that forced Riqui into the squad. But his footballing prowess kept him there.
Setién used a variety of systems in his short spell; 4–3–3, 4–4–2 and 3–5–2. But each was based on the same, possession-based principles:
It was a team that, despite its talent, often looked clumsy and confined. The cerebral, positional football of Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova had been long forgotten.
Here is a clip that sums up that Barcelona. Unforgivably narrow, with a string of short passes through the centre, ultimately looking for Messi to produce something.
In this environment, Riqui Puig was revolutionary. Why? He took this version of Barcelona, a sort of knock-off ‘tiki taka’, and injected a shot of the real thing.
In a tired, uninspiring Barcelona attack, Riqui was admired for his raw exuberance and quality. He brought a sense of urgency and imagination that was lacking from anyone not called Messi. Like Leo, Riqui had that ability to break the mould; to produce something unexpectedly brilliant.
These qualities were the basis of his wide acclaim. Of course, at that time, nobody was focusing on the nuances of his game. His movement, his decision making, his versatility, or defensive contributions. He was only young after all. Years later, we can look at these things with more objectivity.
With this context in mind, the next section is an in-depth profile of Riqui Puig the footballer. It will be largely based on his performances under Setién, but won’t completely exclude his later cameos under Ronald Koeman and Xavi Hernández.
I’ll try and paint as complete a picture as possible.
Starting with the obvious, Riqui Puig is short (5ft6), slender, and nimble. He’s abnormally quick over a short distance, but this is obviously compensated by his lack of strength and physical presence.
As you’d expect of a La Masia graduate, he is technically proficient with the ball at his feet. Excellent first touch, exceptional close control, and a precise passer across most distances — almost exclusively using his favoured right foot.
Riqui compliments his technical skills with a sharp mind, enabling him to make quick decisions in tight spaces or under pressure. This is one of his biggest strengths, which we will talk about shortly.
These attributes obviously lend themselves well to a creative midfielder in a possession-heavy team.
Under Setién, he played as a left centre midfielder (left interior) in a 4–3–3, or central attacking midfielder in a 4–4–2 diamond. In the current Xavi Hernández regime, he’s made his cameos as a left interior in a 4–3–3; his preferred position.
In terms of role, Riqui is what we might call a ‘connective’ player. Left to his own devices, he likes to receive the ball from the defenders, combine with the other midfielders in the centre of the pitch, and help turn low-threat defensive possession into final-third opportunities. Through precise passing and fluid movement.
This complimented perfectly the way Setién’s Barca operated. A lot of passes, mainly through the centre, to players in close proximity. It put Riqui in his element, and he performed brilliantly. Delivering moments of quality that turned deep possession into threat — like this disguised pass through the middle to Vidal:
Or this first touch flick between his legs, again to Vidal.
With workmen like Rakitić and Busquets behind him, and mercenaries like Messi and Suarez ahead, Riqui was the bridge between order and chaos. And it got the best out of his abilities.
Here is a typical heatmap to demonstrate his zone of operation, as an interior in a 4–3–3. You can see how deep he likes to drop, and how infrequently he goes beyond the 18 yard box. This is Riqui’s comfort zone.
In possession, Riqui showed promise for a few reasons:
Precise passing and movement
Riqui is all about moving the ball — both to keep possession and generate threat. His ability to pass accurately, and in a variety of ways, is paramount. While the data is limited, we can see a clear trend in terms of pass accuracy and chance creation.
You can also see he likes to play short and safe, with a relatively low number of progressive passes.
Part of what makes this possible is his off-the-ball movement. He’s a player that is drawn to the ball a lot. It means he gets a lot of touches, and his team maintain high possession. Later on we’ll see why this is a limitation as well as strength.
Rapid decision making
Riqui has an great close-quarters radar. When he drops deep to receive the ball, he doesn’t just do so for the sake of it. Often, he has a pass in mind before the ball arrives. It’s why he can moves the ball with just one or two touches.
This also leads to some decisive, imaginative progression, like the passes to Vidal we saw earlier. In his very best game for Barca, against Deportivo Alavés, this awareness turned into ruthlessness. In that game alone, he managed 5 shot creating actions and got 2 assists. A sign that he could be decisive, as well as responsible.
Close control and dexterity
To round off his positive traits, Riqui is a difficult player to dispossess. Despite his lithe frame, his control, awareness and acceleration make him particularly ‘press-resistant’.
The clip below gives a great example of that.
On to his weaknesses. And it’s here we get a glimpse of the story to come. Starting with his most regrettable:
Careless off-ball movement
While Riqui has a sharp mind for passes, his awareness is limited when it comes to the bigger pitcher: creating and exploiting space. His tendency to come short for passes is useful, but there are times when it hurts his team.
In the example below, his movement to the ball compresses space, congests the middle of the pitch, and makes it easier for the opponents to squeeze Barca.
Moments later, Nico González visibly waves Riqui away, telling him where to move.
This ties into a second weakness: not recognising where the space is. As a result, Riqui is hesitant to run in-behind the defence. He does it occasionally, but it’s not natural for him. This was a trend I saw in almost every game of his.
Riqui’s awareness of the immediate space around him is good, but his sense for the bigger picture, the fluid mechanics of a high-level football team, is not so.
Lack of versatility
What this amounts to is an inability to play any offensive position other than his own. He couldn’t be a winger, not because he is a poor dribbler, but because he wouldn’t understand the necessary movement and positioning.
Nor could he be an effective false nine, because he would not know when to drop deep, and when to occupy space.
The conclusion is very important: Riqui is excellent in his niche, but lacks versatility outside of it. At least, that’s the current situation. He’s still only 22, lest we forget.
The final pass?
This is difficult to judge, purely because of the sample size. Riqui shows flashes of decisiveness, against Alavés for example. But in many other games he’s shown a reluctance (sometimes a lack of ability) to execute the final pass. It was either too late, as he preferred a safe option, or it didn’t hit the target.
The remedy could simply be confidence, which is developed through game-time.
That’s why I’m also going to refrain from commenting on Riqui’s finishing ability. Perhaps he could become a decent goal-scoring midfielder, perhaps not. One way or the other, he would need the chance to prove it.
Unfortunately, when his team is out of possession, we have to skip over any strengths and move straight to the weaknesses.
I’m going to have to lean heavily on stats for this. I would rather not, but the consistency from game to game suggests that the numbers are reflective of Riqui’s defensive ability.
No matter what metric you look at, Riqui’s weakness is clear. I’m going to jump the gun and compare him to Barca’s current midfield options. Below are Riqui’s defensive actions across all his first team games, vs the current Barcelona midfielders in the 21/22 season.
Here’s the data — underneath I’ll list the key takeaways.
Applying pressure
If Riqui were to excel in any defensive metric, it would be here. In fact, he does make a lot of pressures. But they rarely lead to successful turnovers — only 21%.
Tackling
Not only does Riqui have the lowest number of tackles, but is also the least successful with his attempts. He wins the ball back just 18% of the time, leading to more players dribbling past him than his colleagues.
Interceptions and positioning
Of course, many midfielders make up for a lack of physicality and tackling by being excellent readers of the game. Riqui is not one of them. He intercepts less passes than any other of Barca’s midfielders.
This should give you a good idea of Riqui Puig’s footballing attributes. A player with undeniable quality in possession, but one whose profile narrows the more you look at it.
His defensive weakness is glaring, but perhaps more pertinent is his limited understanding of the wider game.
Both of these things bring us nicely to the modern day, where Xavi Hernández is building a team based on a very relevant principle: positional awareness. If you came here wondering why Riqui doesn’t get game time, these next two sections try to answer that.
Many Barca fans, especially those who had praised Riqui in the Setién days, were certain he would get his chance under Xavi.
In fact, reading Riqui’s profile, it might have occurred how similar Riqui Puig is to Xavi Hernández himself.
But it hasn’t happened for our boy. Why? We can only speculate. Based on what we know about Xavi’s Barcelona, there are a couple of relevant clues:
The fundamental pillar of Xavi’s Barcelona is positional play. It’s a philosophy developed most famously by Johan Cruyff, mastered by his Dream Team of the early 90s, and revived by Pep Guardiola in 2008/09.
In this system, the players aim to position themselves relative to their teammates, in order to circulate the ball effectively and be suitably placed to win it back. It’s all about angles, distances, and supreme awareness of the game around you.
Looking at some of Riqui’s movement off the ball, it’s apparent that his positional awareness isn’t always fantastic. We can only imagine that for Xavi, this is a big deal.
Despite being excellent on a micro-level in possession, it’s possible that Riqui doesn’t have enough understanding on a macro-level to use his qualities effectively.
This becomes more of a problem when we look at the new role of the interiors in Xavi’s Barcelona.
Rather than just controlling tempo in the centre of the pitch, turning defence into attack (which is what Riqui does best), the interiors in Xavi’s system are much more expansive.
In build-up, they play high and wide, often along the same line as the centre forward.
That means they’re tasked with much more than just keeping the ball. Along with the wingers, they’re the chief goal creators from wide positions. They are responsible for:
Xavi’s interiors carry a lot of responsibility, perhaps more than any other position on the pitch. They’ll frequently find themselves out wide, in the box, and orchestrating from deep all in the same game.
This requires a unique trifecta of quality, awareness and versatility. And as we’ve discussed, awareness and versatility are two of Riqui’s biggest offensive weaknesses.
In isolation, Riqui’s reliability in possession and ability to create goal-scoring chances would merit some degree of patience.
He might not have all these other attributes now, but given time and guidance, why not? We have seen enough raw quality to believe he can produce at the highest level. That’s surely worth investing in.
The problem is, he doesn’t have time. In his second year at Barcelona, as he wallowed on the bench under Ronald Koeman, the gates opened for a new crop of young, talented midfielders. Players that have stunted Riqui’s development more than any other factor.
Their names are Pedri, Gavi and Nico González.
If you want a quick and diluted conclusion to this story, you can discard everything I’ve said and walk away with this:
The long-term development of Pedri, Gavi and Nico are more important to Xavi than that of Riqui Puig.
We’ve already seen the defensive handicap Riqui has compared to his colleagues. That alone would be enough for most managers to sideline him. But considering how influential the interiors are in Barca’s goal-scoring— and considering this is a team that usually dominates the ball — their respective offensive abilities becomes much more relevant.
For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to compare each player to Riqui in turn, and give the top reason why I think each has won Xavi’s favour.
At only 19, Pedri is already one of best midfielders in world football. Utterly reliable in and out of possession, a full range of precise passing, a talented dribbler in tight spaces, and capable of match-winning goals. Most importantly, he understands positional play as if it’s second nature. Pedri is always moving. Not just looking for the ball, but creating and exploiting space for himself and others. A preposterous talent.
Advantage over Riqui: Higher quality on and off the ball, with a better understanding of positional play. There is no debate here.
At just 17 years old, Gavi is raw talent. Like Riqui, his close control makes him incredibly difficult to dispossess, regardless of space. But what sets Gavi apart is his tenacity off the ball. Under Xavi, Barca’s defence relies heavily on man-to-man pressure, quick turnovers and even tactical fouls. In all of these aspects, Gavi is far more capable.
Combine that with greater versatility, and a natural tendency to run in-behind, Gavi is imperious despite his youth.
Advantage over Riqui: Provides more cover off-the-ball, and has shown better awareness of Xavi’s system.
Nico, at first glance, appears the least remarkable of the group. While very tidy in possession, he lacks the imagination and unpredictability of Riqui. But he has something very important going for him: his physicality. Having been coached as a pivot in La Masia, not only is he clearly the best defensively, but is arguably the most versatile. Despite his size he’s shown impressive dribbling skills and intelligent off-ball movement.
With Sergio Busquets ageing, the team’s only ball-winning midfielder, Nico perhaps has a future in a more reserved role. If so, developing him now becomes absolutely crucial.
Advantage over Riqui: Better defensively and more versatile, able to play in any midfield position. He may be the future heir to Busquets’ throne.
In each case, there’s a reasonable argument for Xavi to leave Riqui on the bench.
Of course this is Barcelona, so there may be other factors involved. Political or otherwise. I would rather not speculate on those purely because we don’t have all the information. But from a purely footballing point of view, it’s not criminal to prioritise these other young talents ahead of Riqui. Xavi has said it himself:
“He has a lot of competition, fierce competition and I feel bad not giving him more minutes. He trains very well, I’m happy with him, he’s improving but the pity is that there is a lot of competition in midfield with Pedri, Nico, Gavi, Frenkie.”
Which brings us to the end of this piece. With Xavi’s first season nearly over, and a vital transfer window coming up, has Riqui simply run out of time? Or, perhaps, is there one last chance?
In 2018, Sport projected that Riqui would become one of the best players in the world. The latest news is that Barca have decided to sell him.
Riqui himself seems unmoved, recently claiming that he wants to fight for his place. But with so many players ahead of him, and the imminent signing of 7th midfielder Frank Kessié, it doesn’t seem reasonable to bet on the young Catalan.
If Barca want to register more players, they’ll be technically obligated to move others on.
In other words, it looks like the writing is on the wall for Riqui. And that’s a huge shame.
Like Gattuso, like thousands of others, I have always been a fan of Riqui Puig.
He does things every Barcelona fan wants to see. He plays one and two touch. He’s inventive and electric. His football language is pass and move.
But in the circumstances, none of that will be enough.
If Xavi had arrived in 2020, instead of Ronald Koeman, it could have been a different story. Perhaps Riqui would have been coached into the new system while his confidence was high, and without the burden of competition.
Now, as it is, his stagnation has left him too far down the pecking order. Talent only gets you so far at Barcelona, and sadly for Riqui, he’s never had the support or belief behind him to make the most of it. But for a miracle, time looks to be up.
Of course, football being football, you can never make any definitive conclusions. Perhaps, some day, the stars will align and Riqui will prove everyone wrong. Perhaps he’ll avenge his lost career. Like Gerard Piqué, Jordi Alba and Cesc Fábregas. Or perhaps not.
For a player with so few opportunities, the fan base he’s established is remarkable. If nothing else, it shows that patience, passion, and a love for your club go a long way. Whichever way your career turns, I’ll be rooting for you, Riqui.
And I won’t be the only one.

Hello my friends!
I have so many essays and journal entries from my time in Spain that I’m excited to share with you on here.
Sorry that I’ve been a bit MIA during the past few months while I’ve been traveling.
I had hoped I’d publish essays every week or so, but perhaps I needed a bit of time for my ideas to percolate a bit more fully.
I am feeling ready though, to bring you my essays and journals that I’ve been writing throughout my time here.
I’ve had so many experiences I want to share with you.
In the meantime, here are some lovely photos from the other day as I walked along the shore. ☀️🌊🤗
Update me in the comments, how was your summer?
How are you feeling?
What you have you been up to lately?
I miss you all!!
Sending love,
Alex ☀️🌊

Everyone deserves a nice relaxing vacation. And I really felt the urge for my long-awaited dream vacation, when summer started.
Fortunately, we could get some last-minute deal and were able to book our first Mediterranean cruise. I was so excited to find that it was departing from Barcelona. I always wanted to visit Spain in my life and now here was my golden opportunity to explore this wonderful city.
In my heart, I could hear the lyrics of the song beating softly: “The Rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain…!” How could one forget the musical My Fair Lady and Julie Andrews singing this beautiful song?
So, we booked our flights to arrive in Barcelona two days prior to our cruise, hoping to spend time in this city filled with history, art and culture. My husband had spent time in figuring out how to quickly get around in the city and visit different places easily without spending much money and time. He also warned me that Barcelona is the capital for pickpockets and we decided to be extra careful. But that was it!
After our long flights, we finally reached our hotel in Barcelona. That evening, we bought our two-day Metro pass and set on our first day adventure to visit Las Ramblas. It was pretty hot and streets were over crowded, but I was thrilled to be in a city displaying beautiful architecture, art around everywhere. That was good enough for me to bear the heat and long walks. While enjoying sips of fresh coffee, tasting different flavors of ice cream, I also had some fun with bargain shopping. We returned to our hotel quite late, but I was glad that we were safe and sound. Since we made it safely through one day in this busy city, it built my confidence level more to travel by metro and wander around busy streets. However, it all lasted only for one more day!
Next day morning we set on our new adventure. We took the metro again and then hopped into the cable car to visit MontJuic Castle. I will never ever forget this day. No, I am not talking about the breathtaking scenery or historical landmarks, but about something unthinkable that happened to me. We enjoyed our cable car ride up the hill and exploring the castle. Everything went well until we decided to take the first stop on our descend by the cable car. I always love taking pictures, but this time I made sure to carry a selfie stick with me, so both of us could be in picture with the beautiful scenery in the background.
We found a beautiful spot, perfect with a railing to lean on and gorgeous view behind. Just as we were getting ready to take our selfie, two guys from the crowd came rushing as if they wanted to take pictures from the same spot. I politely told them to move away, so we can take our picture and then they can take theirs. They moved away a little bit and I clicked for our selfie. Oh, no! I could see the same guy in my selfie standing behind me. How did he even get in there? I was extremely upset but asked him again politely to stay away for a min, so we could get a clean selfie of just both of us. Another try and just as I am getting ready, he again comes rushing behind me, almost hits me from the back. Now I was about to lose my temper when I saw him photobombing my selfie. I quickly lectured him about good manners. Next minute they were gone. Well, I could finally take our selfie of just both of us, with great background and both of us wearing smiles.
Unfortunately, our smiles did not last much longer! Within a few minutes, I felt my bag was much lighter and realized that my wallet was gone from my bag. The zipper of the bag was wide open and the wallet that was so tightly fitting in the bag that even I would have trouble taking out was gone!
How could this be happening to me, when I have been so careful in crowded streets?? Oh NO…!!! Who and where?? How could this be happening? Suddenly I realized that I must have got tricked by those two strangers who posed like tourists and photobombed my selfie. I got distracted only for a few seconds, never even suspected those phony tourists trying to get closer to me. How did I not know their intentions? I quickly looked at my pictures that I took and there it was — the clear evidence of how this crime was committed. I could clearly see in one of the selfies the guy fiddling with my bag behind my shoulder. In the second selfie, same guy was holding my wallet in his one hand and holding his phone with other pretending to take picture. I tried to scream, warn other tourists — but surprisingly not a single person seemed to care. I asked for help to call police and again it seemed no one was worried. One of the street vendor said — “It happens all the time. Just cancel your credit cards, Police will be at lunch now and they don’t have time.” Such a cold atmosphere! I rushed to the cable car station and the lady there said she has no ability to directly call police but will try calling the main office and request them to call police.
Almost after 50 min, we saw two police officers taking rounds. We shared what happened with them, but they could not even take police report from me. I was about to enter in panic mode, but then I recalled my “calming mantra”!
My mom shared this Mantra with me — “Always try to be calm. Never lose your mind in any adverse situation and instead plan wisely to take correcting steps.”
“Crying does not help, take action,” my mom would always say.
What do we need to do now? We are out of country and on our vacation and here I lose my wallet with cash and all precious items. First things first! We started with calling the bank and others to report stolen wallet. It seemed as if it took forever.
Next, we headed to the police station. This was certainly not a planned destination on my vacation. But after 15–20 min walk, we arrived at the police station. This could really make another interesting story. A long line was extending outside of police station. This was only to speak to someone at the window. Every single person in the line had something stolen — either a wallet or their smart phone. After half an hour wait, finally I could speak to the person at the window. Then I was directed to the waiting room to see a police officer. Another 30 min wait time and I became restless. It was quite a large group of people and most of them shared that they had been waiting there for almost three hours. Such a long wait to report a theft! Meanwhile some of them shared their stories of how they got robbed. It was all shocking to me. Some lost their wallets/phones in Metro, some while walking on the streets and some in restaurants/bars or shops. That means no place was safe in this city. Some suspected small kids stealing, some had young girls luring them and some thought those were middle aged men/women dressed decently. No wonder it is called the capital of Pickpockets.
In any case, I could not bear the idea of waiting there for 3 hours. I felt my throat dry, but it was not possible to get even a cup of coffee. I tried my best, but I was asked to wait until my turn came. Maybe it was me complaining or it was my luck, but I was called in within an hour. We lodged the police complaint, shared the pictures of the suspect.
“What are the chances of finding this suspect and recovering my stolen wallet?” I asked.
“Not likely. We will inform you if someone returns the empty wallet. File with your insurance.” The officer said in a cold tone.
It was very clear that nothing was going to be done by police there. Now I know, why thieves make this place as their wonderland. There is no legal action taken unless stolen money is more than 400 euros. Oh well — it is a vicious circle! Thieves rob hundreds of people daily, police tired with making reports and have no intention of taking any action. This is like an infectious disease and it will continue to grow unless treated. Unless it affects tourism and economy of this city, there may not be any wakeup call for the officials.
We returned to our hotel after grabbing a soggy sandwich at McDonalds. The entire drama was physically exhausting and mentally draining. I was angry, but also sad inside. It was humiliating and at the same time I felt as if I lost my faith in all humanity. I considered myself quite smart and alert, but how could someone make me a fool? The entire incident replayed in my mind multiple times making me feel so silly and stupid. How could I fail to judge these people? And why me…?? I thought, this would make me crazy.
Okay, time to stop thinking and chant my mantra — “Keep calm”!
I tried to get all cluster thoughts out of my mind and then tried to sleep quietly thinking about our upcoming cruise. Just because someone stole my wallet does not mean they can steal my happiness and heart.
Amma, the renowned humanitarian has a great message. Remembering her words was a solace for me — “Don’t waste your time and never get attached to material things in life. Instead, build ever lasting relationship through love and compassion.”
I decided to follow Amma’s advice and stay positive. I also tried to build new friendly relationships on my cruise with an open heart. What a miracle! I met so many wonderful people on our cruise coming from different parts of the world. Language was no barrier here and age did not matter too. I made so many new friends.
Nature was splashing its beauty around. It was so nice to hear ocean waves singing at night and see the full moon rising over the ocean. I eagerly watched sunrise and sunset each day. I forgot all worries including my stolen wallet. Those were joyous moments that helped me overcome my stress.
Yes, occasionally I was haunted with thoughts of my stolen wallet and felt the pain. But there was nothing I could do. So why worry? After our cruise, I wanted to give one last try just for peace of my mind and get a closure with the incident. I decided to call Barcelona police stations as well as lost and found places in the city. Not a single phone call was answered. I was not surprised at all. What else to expect? So that was the end of story for my stolen wallet.
If you happen to visit Barcelona anytime, beware! Be careful taking your selfie and try not to lose your wallet or yourself, the way it happened to me!
Also next time, when I plan on taking my selfie — I will certainly make sure nobody is photobombing my picture!

If you watch Barcelona at this point, you would understand how aptly this gif epitomizes the current situation of the club, as we’re halfway through the season its looking like another one of those trophyless outings for the Catalan side. After already being out of the Spanish Super Cup & the Copa Del Rey technically they still have 2 major trophies to fight for including La Liga and the Champions League (yeah good luck with that!) but most fans have lost hope with this season. And now with Xavi leaving the club in the summer things are not looking good this season.
Let’s take a closer look at the underlying issues plaguing this club and how might Barca actually turn this around if they can that is.
Xavi as a player has been a core part of the Spanish national team and the mighty treble winning Barcelona squad which purely dictates his instinct as a manager and how he means to preserve the Barca DNA.
Since his arrival, Xavi has been using his 3–2–2–3 formation in possession or a 2–3–5 shape to great effect as seen below, this shape offers a lot of advantages in build up from the back and chance creation upfront.
This formation consists of a lone striker upfront as Lewandowski, two inside forwards preferably Pedri/Gavi & Gundogan, two wingers/wide players to hug the touchline preferably Balde & Lamine/Raphinha, two pivots preferably Frenkie & Cancelo/Romeu and 3 centrebacks preferably Christensen, Araujo & Kounde.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Xavi’s approach as he has used the same structure to win the league last season by scoring a lot of goals but also maintaining a solid rest defence at the back. Xavi wants his players to equally spread around the pitch and occupy each zone so that every player has passing options around them and can combine easily to escape pressure. Having 5 players in the front line enables them to frequently pull opposition players from the backline to create space with smart off-the ball movements.
With highly technical players deeper such as Frenkie, Gundogan they create loads of chances every game with balls over the top, line breaking passes, swerving crosses. Having Pedri, Gundogan & Gavi between the lines is important as they can easily receive the ball under pressure and turn in tight spaces to play the final pass. With young players such as Balde & Lamine Yamal in wide areas you get runners in-behind as well as players willing to take on fullbacks everytime. And with 3 solid centre-backs in defence they should (in theory) be able to defend well right?
But that is not the case this season, now let’s take a look at some of the issues holding this team back
After getting rid of Fati, Dembele, Eric Garcia and Ez Abde in the summer window Barcelona were mainly looking to add to their squad depth upfront. But with Barca’s never ending financial struggles, it meant that they can only look for less costly replacements, as a result Oriol Romeu and Inigo Martinez were signed to improve their squad depth at the back.
After showing interest in both João Félix and João Cancelo, Xavi was able to get both on loan, all thanks to them falling out with their respective clubs. Where Félix was looking for a fresh start while Cancelo was purely looking for regular playtime under Xavi. With this Barca capped of a decent summer window as compared to their Spanish rivals who went gung ho to improve their squad as well.
After a bothersome start to the season which saw Pedri & Frenkie getting injured and missing some important games in the first half of the season, Barca mostly relied on its youngsters with Lamine Yamal, Gavi and even Fermin getting some minutes every now and then.
Midway through the season they were hit hard by 2 more major injuries on regular first team players: Gavi and Ter Stegen which would see both of them missing the whole 23/24 season. Both of them were integral to Blaugrana’s success and the way they played last year which makes them difficult to replace.
A simple search query tells us that Barcelona have recorded the most xG in all of Europe’s top 5 leagues seconded only by Bayern Munich. But their lack of finishing up top has been a major concern as they have failed to hit the mark time and again. Though xG can be deceiving sometimes when teams attempt a lot of shots at goal, but if we look at npxG per shot Barca still ranks the highest in the league along with Girona.
While most top teams have exceeded their xG by scoring more with a fair margin Barcelona have struggled to put the ball in the back of the net, in fact among the top 15 teams in Europe they have the worst (Goals-xG) stat along with Chelsea (which is obviously not great company at the moment!).
Robert Lewandowski who has been a stellar striker throughout his career has been struggling to even make an impact this season, he’s been pretty subpar when it comes to linking up, making incisive runs and even controlling the ball in the penalty area.
Part of this decline is understandable as he is not in his prime any more and is probably enjoying what might be his last few years of playing at the top level. But, with lack of clear striking options for Barcelona where they loaned out Fati in the summer window, and Ferran & Felix both reluctant to fill the #9 position it has become quite tricky and definitely raises questions on the squad depth.
Though Vitor Roque who was signed in the winter as a long-term prospect might be able to challenge Lewandowski and provide cover for him at this moment.
Generally when we think of Barcelona we think of fast free flowing football, a team boasting of highly technical players all over the pitch playing proper Cruyff football. We rarely see Barcelona being associated with the word “defensive solidity”, but that is what happened last season when Barcelona displayed the best defensive record not just in the league but all over Europe!
A big part of this performance was Barcelona’s newly formed Back 4 which consisted of new summer signings Kounde & Christensen along with Araujo and a young academy prospect Alejandro Balde. This back 4 was Xavi’s preferred combination when fit which conceded just 20 goals in 38 league games and 46 goals in 55 matches across all competitions!
But this season, fans have seen a mere hint of past glory achieved by this combination as they’ve failed to keep clean sheets time and again and keep conceding goals to every opposition they play. Defensive errors at the back have become quite common and their defensive structure seems deformed most of the time. But, who is to blame?
Marc Andre Ter-Stegen who has been a loyal servant for the Blaugrana for almost a decade now, a club where he established himself as a world-class keeper and is undoubtedly the best ball-playing goalie in Europe right now is definitely being missed by everyone. He is a core part of the Barcelona defense as he vastly overperformed his expectations last season by keeping the most clean sheets in the league.
But Barca aren’t just missing his spider-like reflexes on the goal line, they are also missing his great passing range and ball playing prowess from the back. His ability to take charge against high pressing sides and playing a pinpoint ball to a free man upfront has been his career highlight and part of what makes him world-class.
Iñaki Peña who is currently filling for him in his absence has been subpar at best with a poor save percentage, he also clearly lacks the skillset Ter-Stegen has and still needs time to develop as a proper first team goalkeeper.
Conceding early goals almost every time has been the story so far this season as Barca conceded first in 7 out of 19 games before the winter break, with most of these goals coming just within 10 minutes post kickoff. As a result of the game state, Barca are bound to chase games every now and then which causes a lot of impatience among the players as they look to create chances as soon as possible.
Though this in theory should work in their favor but it has instead worked against them as an impatient pass during build up leaves them outnumbered at the back leading to a turnover at times when the defense isn’t expecting. This coupled with the fact that Barca have no natural ball-winners in midfield meaning their counterpressing has been pretty wasteful this season.
Of all injuries that have plagued this team, Barca were hit the hardest by Gavi’s absence, yes a 19-year old midfielder from La Masia is literally the heart and soul of this Barcelona team. His pressing intensity and passion for winning the ball back is unmatched not just in Barca but all over Europe.
The Golden Boy winner is already a regular starter for club & country and has been hailed by Xavi as irreplaceable in his side, despite his short stature he is brimming with confidence and always gives his best in every duel despite the odds. With Barcelona boasting of a highly technical midfield in Frenkie and Gundogan, Gavi provides the bite it needs to dominate every game.
After Busquets’ departure, who was arguably the greatest holding midfielder of his generation and someone who perfectly fit the job description and the style of play at Barcelona, Barca have struggled to match his numbers whether it maybe in defensive actions or the ball-playing abilities he had. Gavi definitely does not match his profile but has stepped up his game alongside Busquets and after his departure in the defensive shift he puts in each game. His ability to man-mark Bellingham and nullify his presence for 70 minutes in the El-Clasico is what amazed me the most this season.
Gavi’s still leading the charts in the number of tackles put in by Barca players despite being out for a major part of the season as shown below. In fact, he’s the #1 ball winner for the team in the attacking 3rd phase of the game and significantly reduces the number of turnovers Barca face.
Gavi is a player I personally adore a lot and he is someone whose mere presence would fix a lot of issues with this team right now. My personal favorite memory of him will always be winning an aerial duel against Wout Weghorst in the Champions League who with all due respect towers over him 😅.
The left-back role provides a tricky problem for the Catalan side in recent times which was sought to be over until the start of this season but instead grows even deeper. A 19-year old academy prospect Alejandro Balde in his breakout season showed the world why he deserves to be on the first-team sheet ahead of veteran full-back Jordi Alba. Balde exceeded everyone’s expectations and completely obliterated his critics with his stellar performances, despite that he has struggled this season and has definitely failed to make the same impact this year. But is it even Balde’s fault?
As discussed earlier Xavi wants to stretch the opposition backline by playing 5 forwards when in possession and in this system Balde is the one who provides width on the left hand side of the pitch. This totally suits Balde’s traits as he is a naturally offensive fullback who can easily slip past defenders relying solely on his pace.
Which brings me to my main point: Balde is an offensive fullback and NOT a WINGER! Look at these stats below comparing wide players from this and last season. Comparing his stats to a proper winger we can see that he attempts less take-ons than actual wingers and instead likes to go around the opposition backline.
While Balde definitely found success by taking on players last season he has been a shadow of his former self this season and part of the reason is that his game is not about taking on fullbacks or dribbling his way through the opposition backline with the ball. Instead it is more about the off the ball movements and the burst of pace he provides to attack space to play dangerous passes/crosses in the penalty area, which brings me to my final point.
Well “A picture is worth a thousand words” and if there is any truth to that adage here it is. Look at this image below, this picture clearly explains some issues with this squad that often go unnoticed.
This snapshot is from Barca playing against Real Betis which was also Balde’s last game after he was sidelined for the whole season. As we talked about Xavi’s structure before how he wants his players to occupy all zones when in possession so that every player has an outlet to play the ball to, in this case the left-half space is completely empty meaning that Balde has no one to combine with and has to play 1v2 against the two Betis players. This sequence results in Balde trying to take-on the fullback and playing an uncharacteristic cross which finds no one and possession is lost.
This issue is not limited to a particular sequence in this match, it has become a common theme among all matches this season which hinders Balde’s ability. The major issue here is player profiling, since the front five in possession consists of Lewandowski and Ferran playing together, both of whom like to drift into central areas and hence create this gap. Last season, this was not a problem as the front five usually consisted of Gavi and Pedri playing as the interiors so the wide players always found it easy to combine with them under pressure. But with Gavi, out of the picture Balde has been totally isolated on the left flank and can barely prove useful.
Barcelona have been blessed to have a Lamine Yamal among their ranks as the youngster has been beyond outstanding in his breakthrough season. In fact, Barca have been heavily reliant on this young prodigy this whole season who has lit up the league and is taking on every player left, right and center.
For me personally, Lamine has been the best forward in this team by a long shot and reminds me why I love watching this team. Despite being a 16-year old he is overflowing with confidence and is ready to take on defenders at will, escape from pressure and mature enough to release the ball at the right time. What amazes me is that he still has a lot of time to develop and with regular playing time in the coming seasons I’m thrilled to see what the future holds for him.
Gündoğan has been nothing short of world-class since the start of this season and has easily become the most consistent player in the squad. While all the other midfielders have been ridiculed with some form of injury in different phases of the season Gündoğan has been Xavi’s go-to-man in the middle of the park.
Due to his technical brilliance and reliability he has played more minutes than other player in the squad and has contributed in single phase of play. Though his preferred position is as an interior upfront, he has also played as a pivot covering for Frenkie in his absence making him extremely flexible. With the season coming to an end Barca could definitely use his clutch potential and big game mentality to save this season.
Though most of these issues and problems discussed above just seem to be small tactical tweaks & psychological issues with the players and their dropping intensity this season, which is not as bad as it looks. Since, Barca don’t necessarily need new personnel they just need to reinvigorate themselves and a couple of good results might just do that.
I hope this blog was worth your time if you made till the end, this took a lot of time & effort and was also my first attempt at bringing my Football knowledge & Data Analysis skills to the table.
Thank you for reading and have a good day! 😅

I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe, and I obviously spent a lot of time observing pedestrian and bicycle culture and infrastructure. Rather than simply envy our neighbors across the pond for their walkable and bike-friendly cities and believe that we Yanks could never match their high active transportation mode shares, I was constantly thinking how I could translate my experiences and observations into on-the-ground change here in the U.S. I also realized that we have some progressive transportation infrastructure on our own soil to be proud of.
We first made the pilgrimage to Copenhagen — the Promised Land for many Americans in the bicycle/pedestrian profession… And it lived up to the hype! The comprehensive network of physically separated cycle tracks was incredible and refreshing, of course, but I was more impressed by how easy it was to walk around the city. Several of the major streets were actually pedestrianized, with motor vehicles prohibited. While some examples of this concept exist in the U.S. — including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade — they feel rather manufactured and not organic.
Even with the dreary weather, we were sad to leave the playground of Copenhagen. But Paris was awaiting us! I had a mental image of Paris as the small, charming town along the river that is shown in films and travel magazines. However, I was immediately made aware of the city’s sprawling size and wide, auto-clogged boulevards. In a way, I was reminded of my hometown of Los Angeles, except that Paris’s Metro system blankets the region. In a flip from my experience in Copenhagen, I had gone to Paris expecting a walker’s paradise, but instead saw a budding cycling haven. The city had already squeezed cycle tracks along many of the major boulevards, and the famous Vélib’ public bicycles were as common a sight as sidewalk cafés and baguettes. The bicycle network appears set up to help Parisians close the “first mile/last mile gap” that often exists in a trip using public transit. I would love to see Los Angeles and other U.S. cities with mass transit networks pursue a similar course.
Finally, we ended our vacation by hanging out in the pedestrian paradises that are old Spanish cities. Barcelona, our first stop, was seemingly built to make walking a pleasurable experience, with interesting side streets, promenades, and commercial districts around every corner. Barcelona and other Spanish cities like Granada and Toledo also make good use of shared streets, or woonerfs, to make streets safe in constrained neighborhoods.
Finally, the many plazas and parklets in Spain’s cities were a never-ending source of resting space and excellent people watching.
Although very different in many ways, Los Angeles can and should follow the lead of European cities by creating safe and pleasurable spaces for people to walk or bike and be outside enjoying our near-perfect weather. And I’m proud to say that the LA region is beginning to seriously take on that mission. Both Long Beach and Temple City now have cycle tracks. LA County Metro is planning a regional bike share program. And through the LA Department of Transportation’s People St. program, several plazas and parklets have been created or are planned for previously underused road space. I’m excited that our leaders are beginning to push for progressive changes to restore some balance to how we move around our own cities.

I always thought I’d visit Barcelona for the first time during the summer or spring. After all, it’s a city known for its blazing Spanish sun and beaches. The idea to visit for December festivities came about when my boyfriend and I decided to go away somewhere close to Christmas this year, as we wouldn’t be spending the holiday together. Barcelona came up as an affordable option and after researching what the city looked like in winter, we were sold.
It’s safe to say it turned out to be the perfect Christmas break and one I’d recommend to anyone. So here is what I got up to over 2 nights in the Catalan city and what I’d recommend for any future travellers.
The first stop after dropping the suitcase off at our hotel was to go for a late brunch at the vegetarian restaurant Faire Brunch and Drinks. Barcelona is a very vegetarian and vegan-friendly city, and it was not at all difficult to find delicious plant-based food. Brunch also seemed to be a very popular meal in the city. People in Spain seem to eat meals later than in the UK. To that end, one great thing about Barcelona, and I believe Spain in general, is how late many places are open. Many of the cafes we visited didn’t shut until 10 at night or even later and…

All it takes is a few terrible decisions to ruin years of success
The last few months have been shambolic for the once-revered FC Barcelona.
For years, their attacking flair, world-class player development, and a selfless “more than a club” mentality drove them to the pinnacle of the footballing world. Boasting outstanding talents from their youth academy, La Masia, like Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, and Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona won every major trophy there was to offer.
But in recent years, things began to falter. The inadequate spending of funds combined with La Masia producing less talent and a brainless short-term player transfer policy soon began to manifest itself on the pitch. Barcelona continued to struggle in Europe’s marquis competition, the UEFA Champions League, and this year’s embarrassing 8–2 defeat to Bayern Munich was the spark that lit the powder keg.
Lionel Messi, the club’s best player who has been at Barca since 2003, tried to enact a clause in his contract allowing him to leave for free at any point once the season was over in June. However, Barca is arguing that the clause is invalid due to the pandemic, and he instead would be sold for the outrageous fee of $700M. The end result is an ugly stalemate with Messi being held against his will by the club he’s given so much to. Talk about a fall from grace.
As fellow fans of the sport know, this disaster is something few could have expected with the vast amount of money and talent at their disposal. But even if you do not follow sports at all, there are lessons to be learned from this success turned disaster. It’s better to learn now since the downfall of a once-great organization is not new and will happen again. You just need to make sure that you take the necessary steps outlined in this piece to avoid your team or organization being one of them.
Leaders have radiating effects that have effects on the entire organization, whether they be good or bad.
A lot of the issues Barcelona currently face were due to one event: the election of Josep Bartomeu as club president.
Despite being someone who had been in the organization for many years, things looked different once Bartomeu took office. He was the one who took all of the things that made Barcelona successful and tampered with them, as I’ll get into in this article.
Consider you and who you appoint as leaders in your organization can impact the morale and the overall success of the people in it. Bartomeu’s stint has shown that leaders need to have a deep understanding of the organization they are in charge of and what has made them successful.
One of the underrated factors that went into Barcelona's downfall is the destruction of Barca’s academy to first-team supply chain fueled by La Masia. Most of the starting XI from Barca’s glory days honed their skills in-house at the academy and learned how to play football under the guidance of important club principles. It’s safe to say that the approach worked.
Under recent leadership, though, things have changed for the worse while under the guise of being better. In a new campaign called La Masia 360, they started straying away from what made the academy so successful in the first place, replacing the famous farmhouse with a glassy, office-like building and diversifying into other sports like basketball and floor hockey.
The changes don’t seem too bad on paper, but slowly the amount of talent that came off the assembly line was not on the same level as the world-beaters of previous eras. Unfortunately, the people at La Masia were too busy focusing on what other clubs like Real Madrid were doing and changing their philosophy accordingly rather than setting the tempo themselves.
Additionally, due to financial problems from irresponsible spending, Barcelona has been forced to sell any talented young players to try and cover their debt. A lot of the best talent from the academy with the best shot of starting for the first team ended up finding success at other clubs.
Without a reference and purpose for employees to follow, or constantly having turnover or having your brightest talents leave, you run the risk of the soul of the company being taken with them. Proper education and the right people in the right places will help define the identity of your organization.
Do not starve your golden goose. Evolution is necessary, but totally reshaping a tradition and philosophy, or straying too far from what made your team great, will only hurt in the long run.
Overreliance on the very few is a problem faced with many organizations and communities and can limit their potential for vast success.
In American football, the Green Bay Packers hit the jackpot when they selected generationally talented quarterback Aaron Rodgers with the 24th pick in the 2005 draft. However, Rodgers’ immense talent meant that the board felt that they should use other picks to strengthen different parts of the team, like the defense and o-line, rather than pick a star receiver that could showcase Rodgers’ talents. They never got back to a Super Bowl after 2011.
The city of NYC is in big trouble because they let so much power be given to so few. With so many rich people living in the Big Apple and contributing to a large part of the city’s economic success, they know that they have a lot of power over the people governing it. So when the COVID-19 pandemic came to town, the city’s rich fled in far larger numbers than other income brackets, leading to Andrew Cuomo’s embarrassing schmoozing of them to come back and talk over dinner.
The message is clear for all organizations: there needs to be a plan in place to make sure that a single unit does not become larger than the whole system.
What that means is different for every group. For Rodgers, it may have helped more to spend draft capital on a receiver than for Barcelona to spend $200M on attackers to help Messi.
The thing is, building a successful team around Lionel Messi in Barca might be the easiest job anyone could do. Even I could probably build a Barca team that could contend for the Champions League, especially after the $220 million influx of cash from the sale of Neymar to PSG.
Unfortunately, Barcelona has gone out and spent hundreds of millions on players that are redundant and do not fit the system. Training sessions went from intense to lazy. Actions like this are frustrating for the millions of fans who follow Barca through thick and thin.
One of the reasons Messi is discontent with the club, as stated in the interview, is that the upper management at Barcelona “had no project” and was mainly focused on plugging any holes in the short term. He could not be more correct.
In fact, after the 8–2 defeat to Bayern Munich president Bartomeu said that things would change in the club. Actions speak louder than words.
They appointed a new manager, but the board that got Barca into this mess is still there. They still are trying to auction off young talent and have not revamped the aging squad, continuing to plug holes and failing to set a long-term vision.
The truth is, short-term decisions aren’t really ones based on rational thinking: quite often, they are reactionary or a response to something like changing sentiment or a consequential event. It doesn’t help that Barca has a very political culture, as the fans vote in who is in charge at the club, which can fog objective decision-making.
The only way to stop a pernicious problem like this is to consciously prevent it. Unfortunately, it seems like nobody on the Barca board is aware of what’s happening.
Now that you know what to avoid, consider what you would do to prevent this situation:
It will be harder to do in practice than just think about but rest assured, history will remember you as the leader of a truly great team.

As a lifelong FC Barcelona fan and aspiring data scientist, I set out to blend my passion for football with analytics in a final project focused on the 2021/22 La Liga season. Motivated by countless hours watching matches at the Camp Nou and a desire to quantify what we saw on the pitch, our goal was to make sense of Barça’s famed passing game, not just through basic stats, but by capturing the spatial context of each play.
We wanted to understand how FC Barcelona occupies and uses space during possessions, and how that might differ from other teams. In this article, we walk through the journey and findings of our project, introducing the concept of dynamic space tagging, the data and methods behind it, the spatial patterns we uncovered in Barcelona’s play (both home and away), and the interactive dashboard we built to explore it all.
Modern football analytics often emphasize the importance of creating and exploiting space — but how can we systematically label where players are in relation to their own team’s shape and that of the opponent? In our project, we tackled this challenge by introducing dynamic space tags: a method to categorize player positions in real time based on team formations. Using convex hulls and simple spatial rules, we drew a hull around all players of a team at any given moment , to represent the team’s shape on the field. Each player was then assigned a dynamic label depending on their position relative to this shape and the goals. The tags we used were intuitive football terms: Inside, Outside, Forward, Back, and a special one for the Goalkeeper. Here’s how it works:
Dynamic tagging captures a player’s spatial role at any moment — for example, a fullback might shift from “Back” to “Outside” to “Forward” as play advances. We apply this to both teams, each with their own hull, so players are labeled relative to their team’s shape. Terms like “Forward” or “Inside” always reflect that team’s formation at that moment.
A schematic showing convex hulls for both teams and example dynamic tags (Inside, Outside, Forward, Back) for players based on their position relative to the hull.
By tagging every player position this way, we capture the spatial context of each pass: who passed the ball from what zone to which zone. For instance, a pass from a player labeled “Inside” to a teammate labeled “Forward” might indicate a ball played from midfield into an advanced attacker between the lines. On the other hand, an “Outside” to “Forward” pass could be a classic wing-to-striker cross or diagonal.
To study these patterns, we needed detailed data from matches. We obtained a specialized dataset that merged event data with tracking data for 25 of FC Barcelona’s matches in La Liga 2021/22. Having both event and tracking data combined was crucial: the event data tells us when and what happened (e.g., a pass, a shot), and the tracking data tells us where everyone was when it happened.
What matches were included? The dataset spans 25 league matches.
Each event (like a pass) comes with a lot of information:
However, analyzing individual events in isolation isn’t enough — football is about sequences of plays. So we needed to group events into possessions.
A key step was identifying distinct possessions and aggregating features over each possession. We define a possession as a sequence of consecutive passes by one team without the opponent intervening. A possession continues until the team loses the ball or the play is otherwise interrupted (out of play, foul, shot, etc.).
We sorted all events chronologically and then walked through them to break the timeline into possessions. Whenever we saw a change in the team with the ball (for example, a tackle or interception where Team A’s event is followed by Team B’s event) or when a certain event indicates a natural break (like a shot that isn’t immediately rebounded, or the end of a half), we marked the end of one possession and the start of another.
The possession outcome, since a possession ending in a goal is very different from one ending in a simple lost ball. This was done by looking at the next event and its subtype — for example, if Team A’s play is followed by Team B taking a kickoff, clearly Team A’s possession ended in a Goal. If Team A took a shot and then the next event is a corner kick for Team A, we know the shot was saved out for a Corner. We created a small catalog of such rules to tag possession outcomes (Goal, Shot on Target Saved, Shot Off Target, Corner conceded, Throw-in, Foul, Half-time, etc.) based on the sequence of events.
By engineering these features, we transformed raw tracking and event data into a possession-based dataset. Each possession (whether it’s Barcelona or their opponent) became a data point with dozens of attributes capturing the nature of that possession.
Handling missing data: We encountered a few minor data issues, such as a handful of passes with missing destination coordinates. These were very few (only five missing entries in thousands of events), and we addressed them by either imputing plausible values or excluding those events, ensuring they didn’t skew any possession metrics. Overall, the dataset was clean and complete enough for robust analysis after this preprocessing.
To clarify how we segmented events into possessions, here’s a simplified pseudocode snippet illustrating the logic:
To uncover patterns in our high-dimensional possession data, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering. Instead of analyzing dozens of stats manually, PCA helped us compress the data by identifying key feature combinations that explained the most variance.
We standardized all features to avoid dominance by larger-scale ones (e.g., number of passes vs. width in meters). PCA then gave us a compact view of each possession, preserving key differences. A biplot revealed that features like pass count, vertical distance, and players involved were influential — hinting at distinct possession styles.
Using the elbow method, we chose a few principal components that explained most variance without extra noise. This also let us visualize the data in 2D or 3D for better analysis and effective clustering.
Clustering (K-Means): We applied K-Means to the PCA-transformed data to group similar possessions, aiming to uncover tactical patterns. After testing different values of k and using silhouette scores for validation, we settled on four interpretable clusters, each representing a distinct possession style.
These clusters weren’t predefined — they emerged from the data. Once identified, we could label each possession and analyze how different teams or matches mapped onto each style.
We wanted to know how FC Barcelona’s possession style compared to other teams. Since each match includes both sides, we had data for Barcelona and their 19 La Liga opponents. By aggregating possession stats, we could profile each team based on how they played against Barça.
Clustering revealed clear differences. About 80% of non-Barça possessions fell into the direct play cluster (Cluster 0), while Barcelona had a lower share (~65%) and more in the elaborate clusters. Notably, 19% of Barça’s possessions were in the wide, multi-player style (Cluster 2), compared to 11% for others. They also had more slow build-up possessions (Cluster 1): 5.6% vs 1.1%.
These patterns matched raw averages — Barcelona had more passes and player involvement per possession, consistent with their possession-focused approach under Xavi and Koeman. The data confirmed that their style stood out through metrics like pass count and number of players involved.
To visualize team differences, we built a hierarchical clustering dendrogram using each team’s possession style. The result was clear: FC Barcelona stood out, joining other teams’ branches only at a high distance — marking it as a strong outlier. Along with Barça, Real Madrid, Celta Vigo, and Villarreal also appeared as distinct in style.
These four teams, especially Barça, Celta, and Villarreal, are known for possession-heavy or unique approaches, so the clustering made sense. Most other teams grouped into a few large clusters, showing similar, often direct styles. Teams like Betis, Valencia, Espanyol, and Real Sociedad clustered closely, with little distinction in how they played against Barcelona.
A 2D PCA plot confirmed this: Barcelona sat far from the main team cluster, reinforcing their unique possession game. While Real Madrid, Villarreal, and Celta were also slightly apart, none matched Barça’s distinct style — even in a season below their usual standards.

We also explored how Barcelona’s style differed between home and away games. Teams often adjust based on venue, and even Barça isn’t immune. By plotting each match in feature space and color-coding by location (blue for home, red for away), we saw a clear pattern: home games were more spread out, while away matches clustered tightly. This meant Barça showed more stylistic variety at Camp Nou, but played more conservatively and consistently on the road.
At home, they played wider and more expansive football, with more passes between central and wide zones (like “Forward” to “Outside”). Home games also had slightly more passes per possession, pointing to greater dominance. Away matches featured fewer wide switches and more central or backward play — suggesting a tighter, more controlled approach.
The scatter plot confirmed this: red points (away) were tightly grouped, while blue points (home) varied more. A few matches stood out — like a direct, less typical home game vs Alavés, or a highly defensive or reactive away El Clásico vs Real Madrid — showing that game context still plays a role.
In short, Barça was more dynamic and varied at home, while away they stuck to a more consistent and compact game plan.

Blue points are more widely scattered, while red points cluster together, illustrating the greater variability in home style vs the consistency in away matches.
To make our analysis useful — and interactive — we built a dashboard using Streamlit and Altair. It lets users explore passing patterns and dynamic space tags across any subset of possessions. The goal was to move beyond static analysis and let users ask targeted questions like, “How did Barça move the ball in 10+ pass sequences?” or “What did goal-scoring possessions look like?”
We had a few key design goals: intuitive visuals of space labels (even for non-technical users), flexible filters to define specific game scenarios, helpful stats, the ability to step through full possessions pass by pass, and clear team structure visuals.
The dashboard has two main modes:
This split allows different use cases — like isolating a key turnover or studying buildup to a shot.
For visuals, each pass or possession is shown on a pitch graphic with player positions, colored by team. Convex hulls outline team shapes, and arrows highlight passes. We kept the design clean — subtle field lines and unfilled hulls — to keep focus on player positioning and ball movement. This helps analysts quickly spot things like line-breaking passes or overly stretched formations.
Filters and user input:The dashboard’s main strength is its flexible filters, allowing users to drill down into specific scenarios. The sidebar includes:
These filters let analysts form detailed queries. For instance: show Barça possessions ending in a goal, with 10+ passes, and highlight “Inside to Forward” passes in those moves. This could identify key patterns or moments worth reviewing on video.
Interactive use cases:Imagine a coach wants to study how Barcelona plays out from the back under pressure. They can select “Barcelona” as the team, filter for passes after a recovery, and set the origin tag to “Back” (including the goalkeeper). This surfaces possessions where Barça regains the ball and starts from deep positions. The coach can then see whether the first pass typically goes to an “Outside” fullback or an “Inside” midfielder, and view the opponents’ positions to assess pressing structures — quickly identifying patterns before turning to video.
Another example: an analyst compares how teams handle Barcelona’s press. By selecting each opponent’s possessions against Barça and filtering for short possessions ending in a turnover (e.g., ≤3 passes), they can see whether teams like Granada lost the ball quickly (mostly Cluster 0), while others like Real Madrid managed more complex build-ups (more Cluster 2).
Technical details:We built the visualizations using Altair on top of a static football pitch. Convex hulls are drawn from player coordinates using standard geometry libraries. To keep the dashboard fast, we encourage filtering and limit default data loads. Navigation through possessions was initially done via a manual pass index, but future versions may include “Next” and “Previous” buttons or even animations for better usability.
The final product is a hands-on tool for deep exploration. It complements static analysis by helping coaches and analysts test ideas, validate patterns, and surface tactical insights in an interactive way.
Conclusion and reflections:This project gave us a deeper understanding of how data intersects with football tactics. Personally, it was rewarding to see coaching ideas like “maintaining width” or “playing between the lines” reflected in actual data. We confirmed that Barcelona’s possession style isn’t just something you see — it’s measurable: more passes, more player involvement, and distinct spatial patterns. We also saw how context — home vs. away, opponent quality — affects even a team with a strong identity like Barça.
Key takeaways:Dynamic space tagging added a tactical layer to traditional event data by labeling player positions in real time as Inside, Outside, Forward, or Back. This revealed patterns like Barça’s frequent “forward ↔ outside” passes at home or how opponents often stayed in “back ↔ back” loops when pressed. These findings are practical for scouting or game preparation.
Our Streamlit dashboard proved useful for visual analysis, but there’s room to grow. We lacked consistent feedback from coaches and analysts during development. Better UX — like step-through buttons or animated replays — would improve usability. Expanding the dataset beyond one team and partial season would help test the model’s generalizability. Comparing different tactical systems (e.g., low-block teams) could also validate or refine the tagging system.
Ideas for future work:
Final thoughts:Dynamic space models bring tactical depth to data analysis. By combining positioning with events, we can move beyond surface-level stats and quantify the subtleties of play. This project showed that Barça’s style isn’t just iconic — it’s distinct in the data. We hope this work sparks more interest in adding spatial context to football analytics — because football is ultimately about managing space and time, and now we have better tools to track it.

Known for its stunning architecture, vibrant culture, and pristine beaches, Barcelona is quickly cementing itself as a booming gravity center for tech and innovation.
The emergence of unicorns such as Glovo (acquired by Delivery Hero), TravelPerk, Belvo and eDreams has spurred the development of the city’s startup ecosystem. This, together with a favorable business climate has bolstered the accessibility of venture capital. According to a new report by Dealroom, Spanish startups now exceed €100 billion in total valuation.
Several experts agree. The Boston Consulting Group has ranked Barcelona as the fifth most attractive city in the world for digital professionals. It also ranks sixth on EU-Startups’ list of the largest European startup hubs. The excitement around the city’s potential is such that Jordi Ribas, corporate VP of Search & AI at Microsoft, said it “has all the necessary elements to become the ‘Silicon Valley of Europe’ in the next 10 years.
In this article, I will assess Barcelona’s potential to live up to this promise, by examining its achievements and prospects in the technology industry.
First of all, Barcelona is strategically positioned as a gateway between Europe and other countries. Thanks to its international airport, as well as the seaport, there is no problem to go to any part of the world and back.
Also, the city’s development strategy has created spaces that facilitate collaboration and creativity. For example, the area of Poblenou was transformed into an urban innovation and technology center — 22@ Barcelona Innovation District. Spaces like these tend to be a magnet for founders, and add a layer of appeal to an already enticing place.
Priscilla Lavoie, a marketing expert based in Barcelona, expands on this. “I think the general attractiveness of Barcelona — the culture, great weather, and central location within Europe — makes it easier for companies in the city to attract tech talent from across the globe. People are willing to move here, which makes the talent pool much larger,” she states.
No innovation ecosystem can flourish without access to capital. Hence, part of Barcelona’s recent prowess is linked to the growth of available funding. According to the Barcelona and Catalonia Startup Ecosystem Report, Catalan startups raised over €5 billion between 2019–2023, 231% more capital than in the previous five-year period. Another report, Mobile World Capital’s Startup Ecosystem Overview, states that Barcelona startups have secured 66.4% of all investments in Spain. It is also worth remarking that according to Dealroom, sectors like climate tech and biotechnology, which hold some of the most promising ventures right now, are snatching most of the capital available for Spanish startups.
This has resulted in a thriving ecosystem. For example, the same Catalonia Startup Ecosystem Report mentions that Barcelona ranks fifth in terms of tech scaleups, with 283. This means companies that have survived the startup stage and have demonstrated their viability. At the same time, projects like the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which now boasts over 150 research projects, create a cluster effect and foster collaboration between academia, Big Tech — Intel, Cisco and IBM, to name a few, are partners of the center — and innovators.
As sizable amounts of funding now gravitate towards deep tech, Barcelona could even have more to win. “Key developments like the recent addition of international submarine cables and the expansion of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center are making the city a prime location for startups in the quantum, AI, and health sectors,” said Nicolás Ventura, Head of Operations at Club GLOBALS, a growth network for tech leaders.
No ecosystem is complete without government support, as founders tend to relocate to entrepreneur-friendly hubs where they can focus on growing their businesses. To increase the region’s allure and attract talented innovators, the Government of Catalonia established ACCIÓ, the agency of business competitiveness. Through its Startup Capital program, ACCIÓ is granting €45,000 to promising tech-based startups. At the same time, the organization is lobbying for policies that make it easier to set up a company in the region.
In 2023, the federal government introduced a nationwide initiative dubbed the Spain Startup Law, which encompassed reducing the corporate tax rate from 25% to 15% for a maximum of 4 years — as long as the company was still considered a startup — and implementing a digital nomad visa to make it easier for international founders to settle. Other measures, such as a 10-year tax exemption on up to €50,000 on stock-based compensation per year, are intended to make it easier to secure talent.
However, there are caveats. To qualify for some of these exemptions, companies needed to be certified by Enisa, a new government agency. Sifted reported that by the end of 2023, only 600 startups were certified out of an expected total of 10,000. Despite these challenges, though, the move seems to have worked with investors. Even if overall VC funding was meager in the last couple of years, Spain seems to have developed more resilience to the global slump.
In Europe, cities like Berlin, London, and Madrid are vying with Barcelona to attract and retain top talent. Compared to some of these European hubs, Barcelona has several competitive advantages. The cost of living is lower than in London or other places like Stockholm, and the lenient weather and more social lifestyle could also have a say.
This, by itself, is not enough though. For companies to have access to a stable stream of talent, a city needs to have thriving universities and research institutions. This is definitely the case for barcelona. Institutions such as GBSB Global and business schools like ESADE, EADA, and IESE, which are listed in the top ranks in Europe, can provide plenty of talent, mentorship, entrepreneurs, and even interns to Barcelona’s start-up scene.
Incubators and accelerators play a key role in boosting a city’s tech scene. Barcelona abounds with them. One of them is Startup Grind, a global community that, through its chapter in the city, has helped connect innovators through gatherings, keynote speeches, and fireside chats. Norrsken, a Swedish impact tech powerhouse, has also set up shop in the city and opened a startup house, as well as Tech Barcelona, a private non-profit that has played a pivotal role in integrating technology into the city.
There are also many top-notch events, something that Nicolás Ventura alludes to. “The city is home to some of the biggest tech conferences in the world, like MWC/4YFN, which gathers over 100,000 tech leaders annually, and the Smart City Expo, which draws global attention and fosters international collaboration on critical issues,” he says. If some factors are paramount to attracting talented individuals, this might be one of the keys to getting them to stay.
Spain’s economic fluctuations can affect investment in innovation. If the overall country’s economy experiences a downturn, funding for startups and research projects might be reduced, causing the founders of these ventures to flock elsewhere.
Bureaucracy can be another problem. As I mentioned, there have been hiccups in the full implementation of Spain’s Startup Law. Canada had a similar problem and presents a cautionary tale. Even though the Startup Visa program looked good on paper, its long wait times diminished its appeal, until many companies chose to establish elsewhere.
Also, there needs to be a careful balance. While growth is good, something that happened in Silicon Valley, for example, is that the excess of capital benefited people who worked for a few companies, but resulted in a prohibitive cost of living for the rest. This led fledgling entrepreneurs to look for other places to start their businesses.
If Barcelona falls behind in some of the aspects presented above, other cities might capitalize on that. There is an intensified competition not only across Europe, but around the world. And despite Spain’s attractiveness, it is still, according to Dealroom, a mid-tier player.
To make a point of comparison, French startups reached a total valuation of €100 billion six years ago, and German startups nine years ago. Does this mean that Spain is lagging that much? Not necessarily, since growth can be exponential. However, it signals something more important. Ambitious startup founders do not hesitate to leave a place where they don’t feel supported.
Compared to professionally-oriented cultures like the United States, Spain is much more relaxed and focused on work-life balance. Also, business tends to center more around relationships.
This is evident in the Hofstede dimension scores. Spain scores low on motivation compared to the US, and high on indulgence. While overall this is not necessarily bad, it is important to strike a balance. Too much pleasure and too little work could cause Barcelona’s startup dreams to flounder.
Does this mean that talented individuals with a big vision will leave? Lena Shagieva, founder of PreggApp, an AI-powered pregnancy tracker, has an interesting perspective. “There is a reason why there is only one Silicon Valley. After experiencing living there and living here (Barcelona) now, I can tell, these places are built for different lives. Silicon Valley is a place with a laser focus on success, on money. It’s a high-octane rat race,” she remarks.
Finally, it could also boil down to money. While capital available is increasing, deal flow is still slow compared to other hubs. “Barcelona has great potential, however, I believe there is a need for a more virtuous circle of money flowing into the ecosystem for it to become the EU Valley,” said Priscilla Lavoie.
She also commented that, “while we have seen interesting exits in the last 5–10 years, the majority of large investors in these companies were from the US, UK, and France, so most of the money leaves Spain and doesn’t really support our ecosystem at home.”
Lena Shagieva also touches on this. “It can be an optic problem, or because money is expensive here, but at the end of the day, businesses need money and startups need to see actual deals happening — know people who have had big money exits,” she says.
The point of comparing many cities to Silicon Valley has been made countless times. Many places have been there — Tel Aviv, the Kitchener-Waterloo corridor, Austin and Seattle, to name a few. However, it is always a misleading comparison, because every city has unique aspects that contribute to its development or lack thereof.
Hence, the idea of Barcelona becoming the “Silicon Valley of Europe” is not accurate. Silicon Valley has singular conditions that result in a high concentration of unicorns, and setting such standards can create unrealistic expectations for Barcelona.
I rather endorse the vision of Luis Cabiedes, one of Spain’s most well-known VCs and angel investors, who states that Spain needs to develop its own model rather than trying to imitate Silicon Valley. In this regard, it is unlikely that Barcelona can rival Silicon Valley in scale. Yet, it still has the potential to become a significant player in the European tech landscape, and to do it in its own way — leveraging its strengths and distinctive advantages.

At PWR House, we see sports teams evolving into full-blown media & entertainment brands that want to do more than just play the game.
For example — today FC Barcelona dropped a limited edition jersey with musician Travis Scott. Only 1899 jerseys were released and predictably, they all sold out instantly.
The jersey features Travis’ “Cactus Jack” logo, the same one featured on all the insanely hyped sneakers he releases with Nike.
This is part of a broader collaboration between Travis Scott and Barcelona leading up to the El Clásico on May 11. Travis Scott will be performing for the first time in Barcelona on May 10th and then the entire team will be wearing their Travis Scott jerseys on May 11.
A lot of this comes down to Spotify, who signed a multi-year $308 Million sponsorship deal with Barcelona in 2022.
Since then, Spotify has given Barcelona a VIP pass to the world of music in a way that no other European football club has. This Travis Scott jersey is just the latest in a series of one-off Barcelona collaborations with artists like Drake, Chris Martin, and Karol G.
Travis Scott is a multi-hyphenated cultural phenom that sits on the Mount Olympus of hip hop & streetwear and there’s no way he would have worked with Barcelona without Spotify’s involvement.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) had a similar “VIP pass” to the world of fashion when they collaborated with Air Jordan. It’s simply good business for a sports team to embed themselves within a cultural vertical like music or fashion.
If a team works with the right partners (like Travis Scott or Jordan brand), they associate with a deeper part of culture. That increases the desirability of the team, which should impact the sales of merchandise and all other ancillary revenue streams.
While I expect some traditional football die hards to roll their eyes at Travis Scott, there are likely millions of young people around the world who have become significantly more excited about Barcelona now that Travis Scott is associated with the team.
At this point, Barcelona has derived significant value from their Spotify partnership in a way that’s unique and better than a traditional sponsorship.

Gràcia, also known as the Vila de Gràcia (village of Grace) lives up to its name. Many years after its establishment, it is still a small, tranquil “village” in the middle of Barcelona’s vast, urban sprawl. Founded in 1626 as a convent, it wasn’t until 1897 that it became a part of Barcelona. That pivotal moment belongs to the larger story of Barcelona’s transition from small town to metropolis; other neighborhoods, such as Sants and Sarrià, are also formally independent municipalities that were annexed by Barcelona during Idefons Cerdà’s expansion of the city starting with his Eixample Plan in 1859.
Today, the neighborhood lives on as a peaceful zone that harbors small businesses and wards off through traffic. Gràcia’s extensive use of creative urban planning measures, like Salvador Rueda’s concept of “superblocks,” means that cars must share the streets with pedestrians, bikers, and children on scooters. It boasts more than 10 lovely plazas, where you can sit for a coffee or “far un vermut,” while kids play in front of you and their parents gossip beside you.
Though it is not one of the first neighborhoods listed in guidebooks, Gràcia is home to many treasures. Among them is the first home designed by Antoni Gaudì, Casa Vicens. Recognized as one of the Art Nouveau movement’s first buildings, it has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The house was originally built as a summer home for the Vicens family in the 1880s. It was closed to the public until 2017 when it opened as a museum. There is some mystery surrounding its patriarch, Señor Manuel Vicens i Montaner. Records indicate that he was a professional stockbroker and currency dealer, though many historians have referred to him as the owner of a tile factory. Given the tiles ostentatiously engulfing the exterior of the building, the latter is certainly plausible.
In 1992, an air-raid shelter was discovered beneath Gràcia’s Plaça del Diamant. The planes’ main targets were the many factories once situated throughout the area. The shelter protected more than 200 people during the Spanish Civil War and is one of the biggest of the 1,300 shelters that were built in Barcelona during that time. Guided tours are offered every Sunday at 11 AM, but reservations must be made online.
Gràcia is a more bohemian-natured neighborhood. Walking around you will notice many shops with hand-painted murals on their doors. One could say this makes it an outdoor art gallery in and of itself. Some of the murals are exquisite works of art, relating to the store’s offerings. You’ll also come across colorful beer cans painted with quotes and pinned to the walls of buildings. These inspiration messages and love notes are done by a mysterious, unknown couple with a beautiful love story.
Gràcia has several shopping promenades where you’re sure to find many small boutiques and artisanal shops. Start at Olokuti on Carrer d’Astúries. This general store sells just about everything and its wares are produced using sustainable materials and processes. Even if you aren’t interested in buying something, there is a beautiful secret garden, accessible from the back of the store.
For clothing, continue down Astúries to La Comet, a small, independent boutique full of made-in-Barcelona pieces and gorgeous gold jewelry. Others to check out are Ktu Barcelona and Padam, as well as Natural Mediterrani, which sells natural soaps and bath products.
Carrer de Verdi links up with Carrer d’Astúries, just past Plaça del Diamant. If you’re looking for great shoes, try Vialis, Mauro’s BCN or Streeters. Salvador Mallol Joier, Bell Estiu, and Pia Barcelona have exquisite jewelry. For clothing, take a peek at Vos Shop and KLING.
Carrer de Bona Vista is another area for fashion finds, with a few more upscale, haute couture shops. POISON Jewels sells one-of-a-kind adornments. Be Store has great gifts for friends and family. Browse BOO, IKA, and Mushi Mushi if you’re looking for quality, locally-crafted clothing. Rêveries has a variety of vintage luxury items. At the end of the street, turn right onto Passeig de Gràcia and you’ll find Lupo, another local atelier, which makes all of its handbags in-house.
Let me follow this by telling you that Gràcia is also a foodie haven. Smaller versions of the well-known Boqueria, Mercat de la Llibertat and Mercat de l’Abaceria are located on the neighborhood’s borders. In the middle, an old, run-down market on Carrer de Puigmartí is being renovated. As for restaurants, there are simply too many homey, independent, quirky establishments to tell all, but I can highlight a few of my favorites.
Mama’s Cafe offers an excellent American-style breakfast, with great coffee and a small backyard garden. For lunch, Taverna el Glop and Il Giardinetto Di Gracia have tasty, very Catalan dishes. If you go during the week you can experience what is known as “el menu del dia.” For the best pizza in Barcelona, sit down at Garden Pizza by Rafa Panattieri, a Brazilian-Italian chef with ties to the famous Roca Brothers.
El Cafè del Teatre and Chatelet are both wonderful, cozy spots to stop in the late afternoon for a glass of wine before heading to a movie at Cines Verdi, which shows many English-language movies with Spanish subtitles.
Bodega Quimet serves up traditional tapas at good prices and with their house wine. At the end of your meal, you can even take home a bottle of what you’ve tried — the concept is to taste the wines accompanied by small snacks. La Xula Taperia is a more modern, Mediterranean-fusion, experimental take on Catalan tapas.
Plenty of places for a nightcap can be found just by strolling around. But some no-fail recommendations are Viblioteca, whose play-on-words title explains itself, and El Ciclista, the area’s staple hipster cocktail bar. At Bobby Gin you can try variations on Spain’s favorite cocktail, gin & tonic.
Looking for live music? Take your pick: Soda Acústic, Cueva de Lobos, and La Sonora de Gràcia are all reputed venues, though be prepared to snuggle up to strangers if you so choose. If you’d like to move your feet, Gràcia Latina and El Sabor are there for a salsa dancing adventure.
Catalunya and the rest of Spain take their partying very seriously.
If you’re lucky enough to arrive in Barcelona during August, you may get to join in celebrating Gràcia’s biggest party of the year. During summer, each of Barcelona’s neighborhoods puts on a several-day block party, known as the “Festa Major.”
In Gràcia, locals spend weeks preparing for their August party, by building elaborate decorations and stages out of recycled materials. Restaurants sell food and drinks, and musicians and DJs play concerts on almost every corner. The annual festival even has its own website and office space to organize the event.
The best way to arrive is via metro. Though there are no metro stations directly in the center, Gràcia is accessible by the L3 (the green line), L4 (the yellow line), and L5 (the blue line). Metro stations Diagonal and Verdaguer have their exits at the bottom border of the neighborhood, while Joanic and Fontana are further up on Gràcia’s outer edges. Once you get there, you’ll enjoy meandering in as it will give you the chance to experience more of the area on foot, which is exactly how it should be.

“Peace is not something you wish for; it’s something you make, something you do, something you are, and something you give away.” — John Lennon
We all nurture, nourish, support and sustain ourselves in different ways. Nurture through grounding may not be a way for everybody and vice versa. We are all way too used to hearing people tell us how to take care of ourselves through instagram, tiktok, wellness groups and other channels that surround us. And although it might be a good way to begin exploring and discovering which self-care means work for you — it can be quite overwhelming.
And that is why I am not here to tell you how and give you unnecessary advise, I am here to simply share and reflect on my experiences. On what makes me feel better after a long day, helps to quiet down my anxiety and connect with the present. If it inspires you to visit some of these places — we share a taste in self-care routines, if not — I would love to hear what you have to say about your ways to keep sane in the world that cannot stop moving.
Below, are some of the places and initiatives I discovered in Barcelona that contribute to nurturing my body and soul.
A tiny, intimate yoga studio in Born offers a unique space unlike any other. I am not a fan of the big, sterile yoga spaces that are common in London or gym chains. The studio features a welcoming reception, a single studio, and a chill-out room, creating the perfect environment to feel at home and familiar. The Chill-out Room at the back of the house almost always encourages me to arrive 10–20 minutes before class to cuddle up on the huge sofa with Claudia’s dog Turron, take a couple of breaths, and shield myself from the hectic outside world.
A wide range of classes is available, from early morning to late evening, to help you start or end your day. There are also more focused workshops, such as those for handstands, outdoor yoga classes with views of the sea, and more experimental activities like “Soltar y Estar” movement classes with Anna Viklund (she deserves a special section, so read below).
A few words from the founder Claudia Paz:
The inspiration comes from a personal need. I wanted a place where I could fully relax and disconnect from the busyness of everyday life, a safe haven to practice with teachers who genuinely focus on my practice and connection. I envisioned a space finished to a high standard, where I could feel fully secure. Casa Paz is different because it’s personalized; all the teachers are amazing instructors. The personal touch is very important — we know the names of our students and genuinely care about them. I love seeing this connection transfer to the students, who often walk through the door with a relieved expression, saying, “Finally, I’m here.”
My favorite mantra, which I often repeat to myself, is “This has already been resolved on its own; the universe has already taken care of this. Everything is going to be okay.” This phrase has been with me for over a year. Sometimes we fight or get mad at certain situations, but the reality is that we can’t control everything: what others think about us, what they do, or how situations unfold. What we can do is be aware of ourselves and give our best. If a day is bad or we have a conflict with someone, the best we can do is learn from it and observe how we can do better next time. We have to focus more on our own path, be respectful to others, and treat ourselves with more compassion.
So many come to mind because each has taught me a lot. But one that has been with me for a longer time and brought me a friend to help in my practice is Urdhva Dhanurasana, the wheel pose. It is a challenging pose for me. I remember as a kid just jumping around doing it, but as I grew up, it became more challenging due to the meaning it holds for me. Especially in the drop back to the wheel, it is a moment of full trust in yourself. It requires, in my opinion, a lot of self-confidence, and that is something I have been working on a lot in the last few years. For me, everything is in that pose: the strength, the connection with the earth through your hands and feet, and looking back with your chest fully open really makes me feel a sense of acceptance.
We have a room at the back of the shala that our community calls “The Chill Out Room.” This is where people relax, connect, read, and drink tea throughout the day between classes. It’s a space for all our members to come whenever they need a little break. It’s designed for our community to meet one another and connect away from the mat to form friendships. My thoughts on yoga teachings are that, as instructors, we are in service to the students. They come to practice because they are looking for something, even if that something is only the final savasana (relaxation). We strive to provide a comfortable and safe practice for everyone.
The month of May was a time of reflection on my body. I worked daily to better understand my relationship with my body, identify the traumas that shaped this relationship, and find ways to improve it through various practices.
One thing I realized was that I did not feel comfortable moving in public spaces as I wanted to. I felt constrained and anxious to the point where I would stop dancing altogether or simply mimic the patterns around me without truly understanding what I wanted to do.
As part of this realization, I decided to take some body expression workshops. Almost by design, I came across the Soltar y Estar initiative led by the incredible Anna Viklund.
“Soltar y Estar” — “Release and Just Be” — are spaces free from judgment, instructions, and expectations. They allow you to enter a meditative state and play with your body through movement, meditation, and group connection. For me, this is a space where I come in with no expectations and leave with a tired body, a clear mind, and valuable lessons learned. Anna manages to challenge but never push, encourage but never force, lead but never dictate.
In addition to group classes, which have a special energy due to their communal nature, Anna also offers personalized one-on-one workshops — something I have yet to experience. In just a few weeks, dance transformed from something I dreaded into something I couldn’t wait to do.
A few words from the founder Anna Viklund:
Soltar y Estar is a conscious playground where you get to connect with your own body. It’s a safe space that we create as a group where each session is a unique journey but with a fixed destination- The present. Listening leads us to connection, which leads us to openness, curiosity removes judgment and invites us to move. The movement invites us to play, where we release the control and forget about our identities. And there we find ourselves in pure joy, vitality and compassion. A soft body and a sharp mind. Soltar y Estar is pure Body Expression! It’s a wonderful way to get to know people through a moving body.
Movement for me is feeling myself. Movement is home, it’s expressing and listening. Movement is clarity! Movement is massage, meditation and cleanse. Movement is to get drunk and to get sober at the same time. Movement is to explore, play and create. Movement is getting to know myself. Movement is vitality. Movement is absolutely necessary for me to be able to be a present and conscious person.
Our body is our greatest teacher and we are our own healers. All we have to learn is to listen.
If I am my authentic self, I invite people to be authentic too. When I open up, you open up.
Dance and movement is a very powerful way to get to know yourself and your own body. Dancing in contact with another person is a very powerful meeting. Dance without a shape and without rules is very healing. Dance loses 100% of its magic if you start comparing yourself with others and when you lose the connection with your inner world.
Trying new things is connected with curiosity. Curiosity can replace judgements. What ever you are judging within yourself or in others could completely change perspective if you choose to look at is with curiosity, for example “I can’t dance, I’m feeling like a loser” vs “interesting, every time I move in front of people I get insecure, what would happen if I practiced that’”. Trying new things opens up your mind, breaks your patterns and is a straight portal to self growth.
Yet another multi-experiential space combining all aspects of well-being is located in the heart of Barcelona at Placa de Tetuan. The thinking behind Frizzant is quite innovative; the space is designed to support all the daily activities of our community: working, participating in conscious movement classes (yoga, dance, etc.), socializing, and enjoying meals in a cozy, inspiring environment. Does this cover pretty much everything I aim to do in a day? Yes.
I have to commend the designer of the space — it is one of the most beautiful and thoughtfully designed modern studios I have ever encountered. I was truly fascinated the first time I showed up for a class here. Regarding the classes, Frizzant represents the modern evolution of yoga: a dynamic, social, and urban practice that avoids dogma and encourages body expression and emotional growth.
The café offers a unique selection of fresh fruits and vegetables — something you don’t often see, even in most supermarkets, where cucumbers are suffocating in plastic wrappers.
A few words from the founder Sonia Sala:
(Courtezy of https://frizzant.com/)
For me, there is no better way to ground oneself than by connecting with nature. It’s a free, accessible way to remind yourself where you come from. “Accessible” may sound like an overstatement when living in the chaos known as the city, but I will try to break the stereotype that nature in Barcelona is always at least a day-long escape.
Montjuic
Every time I head to Montjuïc, I end up in a different place. I still struggle to grasp just how big it is, what it hides inside, and where it ends. Apart from a beautiful hike offering a fantastic view of the city, with hidden nature-filled spots, forests, and parks, Montjuïc also offers a wide range of historical gems to entertain your mind. You can easily spend more than a few hours here, breathing much cleaner air than down below. Multiple foundations, Montjuïc Castle, and the Roman Theatre are scattered around the maze of Montjuïc, ready to entertain. I encourage you to walk without a map and see where you end up, because I bet you will discover something new every time you come back.
The Sea
Oh, how incredibly lucky I am to have the sea in Barcelona. Having experienced living by the sea, I can never go back. One of the true sources of happiness, energy, and peace for me is hearing the sound of the waves and seeing them crash along the coast — no matter the weather, no matter the season.
My favorite places to sit by the sea:
Always remember to make time for yourself.
See you in the next one,
Anya

As a teenager, my favourite Vietnamese restaurant was ‘Lucky Star’. This tiny hole in the wall can be found in Balmain, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, Australia.
For some strange reason, the place had a fascination for global music. Every year, they’d slap posters all over their walls of tours, festivals and everything in between. There was one poster in particular that always had a prime position amongst the clutter. PRIMAVERA SOUND. Names like Tame Impala, The Strokes, Radiohead, Flying Lotus and Dixon would always glare down at me, while I slurped down won ton soup. Artists I’d been dreaming of seeing for years and years. In just over a week these dreams become reality!
Here’s why I can’t wait to attend Primavera Sound 2019, and it’d be fantastic to see you there too!
If it was the lineup that first won me over, it was the festival’s location that really got me drooling. Situated in the north-east of Barcelona, this expertly designed space was put together to host events of epic proportions.
Picture a beautiful labyrinth of concrete, an amphitheatre, a beach space and comfy grass spots. From what I’ve been told (by many overly excited friends) the space feels like a vortex, drawing you further and further in. Imagine clambering to the top of a hill for a better view of Erykah Badu, then stumbling through a passage and popping out in the midst of a rave thanks to Job Jobse. Let me remind you, there’s a place to kick off your shoes and dance with sand between your toes (I mean who doesn’t love that)? I could blab on and on about a venue I haven’t even set foot in, but like they say the ‘proof is the pudding’. And for some reason, I just know the pudding’s going to be delicious!
This one speaks for itself. Barcelona is an outstanding city! From stunning beaches, scrumptious tapas, pumping nightlife and Gaudi’s insane architectural feats it’s full of diversity. For me, this sounds like the perfect day on earth; wake up, head for a Spanish bocadillo, next pick up some beers and ice with one goal in mind — the beach. Post swim, head home to shower and refresh, arriving at Primavera just in time to see Pusha T take the Main Stage. Undoubtedly, this will be one of the better days you’ve had in quite some time.
One of the biggest drawcards to festivals these days is their vibe. Statements like “beaming sunshine, full of smiles, totally free” get thrown around all the time. It’s often hard to work out which of these blanket claims you can trust but in Primavera’s case, the mountain of good word spoken it can’t be ignored.
I’ll often probe my friends who’ve been and ask why it’s such a magical feel and most say something like “I don’t know there’s just something in the air”. Of course, the artists involved and curation is key but you really can’t put a price on an authentic feeling of enjoyment! I guess it has to be seen to be believed.
I mean I alluded to this in the intro but it goes without saying there’s seemingly an artist for everyone at Primavera. If you’re a rap lover — there’s Nas, a soul diva — there’s Solange, a pop hound — there’s Miley Cyrus or an underground club connoisseur — there’s Anthony Naples. There’s an overall level of calm about the lineup every year as it’s always golden.
If you’re an expert planner, you’ll spend 72 hours basking in the Barca sunshine, chasing your favourite artists from stage to stage. There are that many people booked, I’m expecting there’ll never be a dull moment.

For my poster, I decided to sell the Barcelona Chair, which was designed by Mies van der Rohe. When I read the list of values, power immediately jumped out at me as a perfect way to “sell” the chair- having a Barcelona chair in your home or office is kind of a status symbol, and the chair itself just assumes an powerful stance.
Lino printing is my favorite hobby, and I decided that this medium would actually help present the “power” value really well. A linoleum carving prints an image in one color, with stark, sharp lines and high contrast, which you can see below in my final poster. The slogan I chose, The Most Interesting Chain in the Room, is a play on the highly recognizable Dos Equis ad which features “the most interesting man in the world”.
Despite my experience with lino printing, it was challenging to put this together in quarantine. I had run out of most of my materials, and when I couldn’t find any place to buy a fresh linoleum block in time, I decided to use the backsides of two linoleum blocks to carve the image in the size I had printed. Printing the image to transfer presented a whole other issue- I don’t have a printer, and was able to get one copy of my draft from a friend’s work place. This gave me one chance to transfer the image (which I don’t do very often as the process requires chemicals or an iron, of which I had neither), and I wasn’t able to transfer the image successfully. In a last ditch effort before free-handing the drawing (which would have taken much longer than the alternative), I traced the two different sides on parchment paper and rubbed the transfer onto the blocks.
I actually made a lot of mistakes while carving this because the left and right side were disconnected from each other. You can see this in the sunburst background, which I had intended to be white throughout, but it turned out to be a little bit of a happy mistake, and I think it makes the print a little more interesting. As for the other mistake, my dad sent me the following quote when I sent a picture to my family accompanied by a list of the details that hadn’t turned out exactly as I’d pictured-
Oblique strategy- amplify your mistakes. (Not that I see any)
A great reminder that sometimes I can be my own worst critic!

While walking spontaneously through the streets of Barcelona, the capital city on the coast of northeastern Spain, my partner and I of Goodspero, two multi-media creatives from Houston, Texas, US in town to film alongside Geoffrey Moskowitz of Fat Cat Productions, and his clients, Sean Kinney and Catherine Sbeglia of RCRWireless News at the MWC (Mobile World Congress), the world’s largest tech conference/exhibition for the mobile industry (which was cancelled a few days before we arrived due to fears of the coronavirus)— we happened to stumble upon The World of Banksy in Espacio Trafalgar.
Between filming, editing, social media, writing and otherwise catching up on our work during down-time now that the conference was cancelled, and while walking back to our host’s apartment in the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), to grab our laptops and head to the nearest cafe, we caught a glimpse of a sign named after one of our favorite street artists, also a political activist and film director. While crossing the street we decided to take a quick detour and slip into the building through the open glass door — plus I spotted a restroom sign inside and desperately needed to use the bathroom.
Upon walking in I assumed the building was some sort of lobby, perhaps for living quarters, or one of the many private corridors with street art adorning the walls. We never imagined that we had just walked into a press/media day preview for the newest Banksy themed art exhibition featuring 100+ works inspired by the artist that was set to open the next day (February 25, 2020).
I completely ignored the fact that I had to relieve myself as we found ourselves immersed in Banksy art the moment we walked in. I thought, “what an AMAZING public art display”, oblivious to the fact that we had inadvertently snuck into a private and closed building (never mind the keys hanging on the front door which I paid no mind to regardless of my partner’s questioning whether or not we should be in there). I was already far too captivated by all the art.
While taking in all the familiar pieces in the first room, including text printed on the wall in multiple languages that quoted the artist:
“I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal, and amend my art for amusement, academic research, or activism…”
I snapped photos of a replica of one of my favorite stencil pieces, “Girl with Balloon”, first spotted in London and has since been used by the anonymous artist to support various social campaigns including the Syrian refugee crisis and the Israeli West Bank Barrier.
It was also the piece infamously destroyed by Banksy who had a shredder hidden in a frame that was set off immediately after the piece was sold during a live auction of his work. The anonymous European woman who bought the piece for £1,042,000 ($1,346,652 USD) before it self-destructed, ended up keeping the artwork and was quoted saying she now owned her “own piece of art history”.
Down the hall, multiple “Kissing Coppers”, depict two male British police officers kissing, another favorite stencil graffiti art piece of ours originally spotted on a bar in Brighton, England, known to many as the LGBTQ Capital of the UK. The original piece was vandalized multiple times thanks to the country’s attitudes towards homosexuality at the time and the piece was eventually and controversially removed and sold by the bar owner who put up a replica in it’s place a little over a decade ago. As an entrepreneur, I supposed I can appreciate that he reportedly used the approximate half a million dollars in profits to continue sustaining his business.
Before moving on to the second floor, my partner and I snapped a photo imitating “Mobile Lovers”, one of the featured stencil pieces on a wall blocked off by a chain and a couple of steps below the first floor at the far end of the room. It’s of a couple embracing with their faces lit up by the lighting coming from their cell phones which they’re holding behind each other’s backs. A perfect depiction of us in our worlds. Some may look at this piece and think it’s sad — to me, it’s beautiful. Not many would understand or feel the same way but I see my partner and I in our natural state. Our video and social media business and the freedom we have to work from Barcelona and to work with each other daily wouldn’t be possible without our mobile phones — nor would we be here, enjoying this exhibition thanks to MWC 2020. Just another unpopular opinion perhaps.
Upstairs in the next exhibition room there are several moving pieces that I’m left too drained to describe. The political nature and social narratives in each piece on display remind me of all the reasons I left the 9–5 world and began a creative career with the goal of shining a light on the many messages and injustices often left unspoken. A world in which I’m now able to create, write about and share visual art in many forms that educates and inspires others to take action in order to leave a social impact on our world.
I haven’t yet reached the level of focusing on controversial works like the “Toxic Mary” pieces of the exhibition, in which the Virgin Mary is feeding baby Jesus a bottle of poison. Nevertheless, these pieces are dear to me for reasons other than what it was perhaps originally intended to portray — the toxic nature of religion. To me, as a child-free by choice woman, living in a world that encourages even young girls to pop out babies left and right “because you’ll never know what love is until then”, I am drawn to visuals and texts that are even remotely anti-baby or anti-motherhood. I am 100% pro-otherhood. Anti-religion aside — I must stop here and thank the curator for including these works in the exhibition.
And even non-Banksy fans can surely appreciate, “Christ with Shopping Bags”. Because really — what better way is there to celebrate Christmas in our typical consumerist societies than to shop excessively in the name of Jesus and “love” and making children, family and friends “happy” — and for many — getting into even more debt, or staying in debt, until the next holiday.
By the time you make it downstairs and into the most immersive parts of this exhibition, you have only been given a taste of Banky’s art through stencils, a few physical incorporations of flowers, grass, paper and magazine photos protruding from some of the pieces among other items. There are even a few auditory police sirens encased in crates and other surprises I’ll leave up to your multi-sensory experiencing pleasure once you actually visit this detailed exhibition.
Be sure not to miss the elaborate displays downstairs at the bottom of the building — we almost did. Were it not for spontaneously running into the gracious exhibition’s curator, Haziz Vardar, we would have completely missed it. Not only did Haziz not immediately kick us out of the private and mind you, closed, press viewing once realizing we hadn’t been invited by Rosa(?), but he and his partner happily shared Banksy stories with us about having started the exhibition in Paris last month in January and how the one we were standing in was set to open to the public in the morning. Not a friend of Banksy, but immediately a friend of ours, Haziz welcomed our intrusion and invited us to continue walking around, encouraging us to take pictures, post them to Instagram, and to go downstairs and let the staff know we were “friends of Haziz” so they’d give us a little gift bag with perhaps a book or surprise inside. We were not disappointed and left with a canvas bag with the “Kids on Guns Hill” print, a matching magnet and a book from the exhibition (pictured at the end of this article below).
We would never have imagined some of the best pieces were yet to be seen in an entire floor underground. There’s a replica of a room in “The Walled Off Hotel” downstairs featuring a painting of an Israeli border policeman and a Palestinian in a pillow fight above an actual bed, identical to the one Banksy created in one of nine rooms in one of his largest artworks — a Palestinian boutique hotel in Bethlehem boasting “the worst view in the world”. It’s a hotel in front of a concrete wall built by Israel that encages Bethlehem. Although it was meant to be a temporary hotel/artwork, it has become one of the town’s top tourist attractions, blatantly educating its visitors of the daily life and confinement of Palestinians facing Israel’s military infrastructure.
Please friends (and strangers alike) — especially those left stranded in Barcelona without as much work as originally planned thanks to the wonderful coronavirus fears, you MUST stop by this exhibition. Grab a book as you “Exit Through the Gift Shop” on your way out. As the BNKSY & Artwork’s book states, the entire experience is “100% unauthorized by Banksy” — much like our approptiate and literal “sneak peek” of this exhibition in the beautiful Barcelona. Vale.

Stories and learnings from the team behind Qonto

At Qonto, borders are no barrier to talent.
And with Spain being voted the best European country for expats, it’s no surprise that a growing number of those working in our Barcelona office hail from outside of Cervantes’ country. As of October 2023, 96 of those at Qonto Barcelona were from somewhere other than Spain, representing 28 countries from across the world.
It’s a melting pot of cultures, views, skills, and languages spoken.
But what’s the reality for those making the move? What’s it like when Spain becomes your full-time home, rather than a holiday haunt?
Hear from five Qontoers who switched their native nation for Catalonia’s capital.
Making light work of paperwork
Relocating can feel exhilarating and exciting; a voyage of discovery. When moving from abroad with Qonto, there’s always a dedicated point person to help you navigate the thornier challenges that can present themselves, relieving any bureaucratic stress.
This applies from the very first contact, with an interview process French native and Qonto Fraud Agent Felix Gleizes describes as “very quick. My Talent Manager, Andrea, kept in close communication with me, and I quickly had my first interviews with my future manager. Andrea was able to answer all my questions and support me throughout the process, putting me in touch with members of my team to facilitate my move.”
Every foreign resident in Spain will have a unique Número de Identidad de Extranjero (NIE) — an individual ID document required by the Spanish government. It’s needed for everything from opening a bank account to setting up internet, phone, and utilities.
Forget wading through papers and trying to make sense of a new country’s rules and regulations; the Qonto People team in Barcelona is on hand to support new movers in applying for and securing their NIE and their social security number.
It was an invaluable add-on for Salma Kosbr, Customer Success Manager for VIP clients, who grew up in Paris. “Qonto helped me to get my NIE card, as well as helping me to get my empadronamiento [the process of being added to Barcelona’s resident census], which was really helpful.”
Qonto’s People team’s wealth of knowledge offers valuable reassurance, which is often needed when making a life change. As Martin Velly, Countering the Financing of Terrorism Officer at Qonto, shares, “During the relocation process, I was confident that I was in good hands, and I just went with the flow to discover step by step where my feet would land.”
It’s not just the legal paperwork that you’ll get support with. Qonto partners with global mobility company, Santa Fe Relocation Services, to set new joiners up in their very own homes.
And when it comes to the extra expenses incurred when you move somewhere new, there’s an allowance made for that, too: “I received a relocation package from Qonto, which helped me a lot to move all my belongings from Paris to Barcelona, so I could save a lot of money and start fresh,” Salma shares.
With numerous other international colleagues in the office who have gone through the same expatriation process, you’re never short of someone to seek informal advice from; whether you want to know about the most desirable neighborhood to live in, or you’re seeking the best local spots for tapas.
English: the lingua franca
When you’re relocating to a new place, language will naturally be a consideration. And in the case of Barcelona, two languages are in circulation; Castilian and Catalan.
But those who don’t know their ‘perros’ from their ‘peros’ needn’t be discouraged.
English is the official language in the Qonto office; it’s the language in which meetings and most socials take place. According to Martin — a non-native Spanish speaker — ”The office in Barcelona is really international. Everyone speaks English, but if you’re willing to relocate to Spain, you’re likely to have a curiosity for the language. In that sense, the office is a perfect tower of Babel, with many languages spoken and the chance to try out your skills in an informal setting.”
In Salma’s view, “To get a truly international experience, Barcelona is amazing. But if you’re hoping to go further, and live the Spanish life, I’d say it’s valuable to learn the language, to get under the skin of the culture.”
And Qonto facilitates this cultural exploration, for those who have the desire to flex their linguistic muscles. Language lessons are provided free by Qonto partner Busuu. “Busuu is perfect for any Qontoers living abroad and willing to learn,” Martin comments. “It’s a platform which offers personal, live classes with a teacher where you can practice your speaking. Having that dedicated one-on-one time is one of the best ways to get comfortable in a new language. It’s a great benefit, whether you’re using it because you wish to communicate with Spanish natives socially, or because you want to broaden your professional horizons.”
Teamwork makes the dream work
A big pull for many candidates considering relocating to Barcelona is the strength of Qonto’s people. Taking up a new position is made easier when you’re confident that you’ll be shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates who are motivated to achieve great things.
This was true for Salma, who was aware of Qonto’s reputation before joining. “Knowing that I’d be working among some of the most knowledgable people in the industry was a real selling point for me when it came to moving to Barcelona to take up this role.”
And for Eleonora Cusanno, who looks after Qonto onboarding for the Italian market, it was a very quick settling-in process in among her peers. “Once I started and I met my colleagues, I felt immediately part of the team and supported. The people here are brilliant, highly talented, and very friendly. When you start a new job, it’s really important to know that you’re surrounded by a strong cohort of colleagues who are there to help you grow — and vice versa. That was the case with my team here at Qonto.”
Sea, city…and start-ups
While Barcelona is a popular vacation destination, with its ‘fun in the sun’ reputation — it’s a city of cerebral substance, too.
A wellspring of start-ups have settled in the Catalonian center, giving it serious credentials as a bustling hub of innovation. Qonto — with its status as a scale-up leading the market as a business finance solution — counts among its number of fast-growing and exciting enterprises.
Qonto’s office, located in a co-working space in central Barcelona, is equipped for both work and wellbeing, with yoga classes, meditation sessions, self-serve snacks, and drinks on offer.
It’s an environment where the pursuit of parity is front and center, with a 44% female workforce compared with 17% in the tech sector overall.
And the Qonto culture is carefully designed around making new connections. For Julie Santanoceto, who moved from Toulouse, France to Spain to take up the role of Anti Money Laundering Officer, making friends happened naturally. “The office is very international and diverse. There are always lots of colleagues who are newly arrived in Barcelona, so it’s easy to meet people and integrate.”
Events hosted in and outside of the office create natural moments to mix with new colleagues socially. Evening entertainment runs the gamut from paint and tapas evenings to escape room excursions, with Qontoers free to sign up to whichever activity appeals to their tastes. Martin describes the recent appointment of a dedicated Qonto event planner as “life-changing, because out-of-office activities help us to develop deeper bonds.”
With sangria served on tap (to be enjoyed outside of working hours!) and a sun-soaked rooftop terrace complete with fuzball table, the office is a place where work and play meet.
Living la vida catalana
Though the Qonto office is well kitted-out, life doesn’t start and end in the workplace. Being in a bustling city like Barcelona means plenty of opportunities to enjoy all that the metropolis has to offer.
It’s a place steeped in history and art, perfect for those wanting to get up close and personal with culture. Barcelona plays host to more than 80 museums — perhaps unsurprising, in the city that was central to the Modernism movement — as well as 100 different beaches, from stretches of silky golden sands to hidden rocky coves.
Felix describes weekday evenings spent enjoying the Barcelona beachfront. “Having the sea just 10 minutes from the office means you’ve got a great way to relax and recoup after work, right on your doorstep. And it’s also a perfect place to go out with friends at the weekends.”
Swapping Brussels for Barcelona meant that Martin could find much-sought work-life balance. “In Qonto, for most positions, you have the option work remotely and to adapt your schedules, to a certain degree. Everything is put in place for you to find a good alchemy between work and everything else. As an example, during spring and summer, you will see some Qontoers starting their day early to go to the beach in the afternoon. Others with children successfully balance work and a quality family life.”
For Julie, the reality of living in a seaside city matched her expectations. “I dreamt of Barcelona as a sunny, vibrant place — and it is! There’s a lot to do, and the winter weather is delightful when you come from somewhere like France.”
And there are other, more practical, benefits. “Of course there’s the good weather — but there’s also well-managed public transport,” says Salma. “It takes me 35 minutes to get to the office, door to door. In Paris, even by car, 35 minutes is unheard of!”
Thinking of moving?
Finally, when it comes to words of wisdom, lived experience is often the best teacher. And the verdict from Qonto’s Barcelona-based expats is unequivocal.
“The relocation to Barcelona was very easy. I felt safe making this change, knowing that I had Qonto supporting me,” explains Eleonora. “I would definitely recommend moving to Barcelona to work. The atmosphere here is exciting, there are people from all over the world in the office, and the cultural scene is very lively and buzzy.”
When it comes to superlatives, Felix places the city at the top of the list for international workers. “For me, it’s one of the best European cities to move to as an expatriate. Even though it’s a regional capital, it’s still a city on a human scale.”
Martin found that his own high hopes around life in Spain were surpassed. “The reality at Qonto Barcelona is beyond my expectations. I really quickly got used to my new environment and found a life-work balance which makes me happy. I do not regret for a second having taken this decision.”

Last month we spent five fun filled days in Barcelona and found five different things to do if you’ve finished all the top tourist spots in Barcelona, or if like us, this wasn’t your first time and you wanted to mix it up a little bit!
The Kissing Wall is an art installation in the Gothic Quarter down a little passage. It is a photo mosaic created by the people of Barcelona to commemorate the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 which ended The War or Spanish Succession. The people of Barcelona have contributed photos which show ‘moments of freedom’ and it is a mesmerising piece of art work which you can explore forever.
“The sound of a kiss is not as loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a great deal longer”, Oliver Wendall Holmes.
2. Drinks at H10
So, yes, the W Hotel in Barcelona does have a lovely view of the beach, but it also has a lovely view of the financial district and the shipping lanes… How would you like to have a drink at a roof top bar in the middle of the Gothic Quarter with views of La Catedral, La Sagrada Familia and downtown Barcelona? Interested? Good!
H10 is a hotel situated on the edge of the Gothic Quarter and it is free for tourists to visit and have a drink. It’s not a high as the W or as fancy pants inside but then also not as expensive and you can sit outside on the deck with the sun on your face (it also has a plunge pool, wink wink!!). The views of La Catedral, are stunning as are the rest of the 180 degrees. This trumped our trip to the W in a big way and we would highly recommend an early evening beverage here!
3. Sagrat Cor
Sagrat Cor has one of the best views over Barcelona hands down, toes down, head down. It is only a 20 minute bus journey out of town and takes you to a different Barcelona (you catch the T2A from Placa de Catalunya).
Sagrat Cor is the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and located on the peak of Mount Tibidabo. You can walk to the top or you can get a lift and you have a 360 degree view stretching from the beach to the hills behind Barcelona. Sagrat Cor also has a mini Christ the Redeemer right on the tip, so if you haven’t quite made it to Rio yet this might satisfy the cravings slightly.
Also located at the top of Mount Tibidabo is a small amusement park, so if you fancy grabbing an ice cream and jumping on the Ferris Wheel you can enjoy this view being a 12 year old again.
4. Japanese food
Our hotel was located north of the Ramblas by about a 10 minute walk and when you walk this far you luckily fall into the Japanese district which has some amazing Japanese food. If you’re full to the brim of Tapas and Paella then we would highly recommend venturing this way and stopping off for a nibble of sushi or tempura.
Top Tip: Restaurant Japonès Toyo has an all you can eat sushi train for ONLY 10 EUROS!! So if you like us and love a little bit of Yo Sushi but only limit yourself to a couple of plates because you don’t want to take out another mortgage, this is the place for you. There will be a queue, it might be around 10/15mins but it is worth the wait. We have to admit we ventured here twice for lunch because the food is insane and SO reasonable!
5. The Olympic Swimming Pool
Now, last but not least is the Olympic Swimming Pool. Why would you want to go to an old Olympic Swimming Pool from 1992 (before Camilla was even born!)? Why wouldn’t you? It is located at the top of a hill which you can get a cable car to the top off to save those precious legs of yours and the views are amazing. What’s even better is that if you go in August you are able to swim in the pool and appreciate the views while bobbing around!
Hopefully, if you are looking for something to do off the beaten track, this has sparked some ideas for you! Barcelona is such a vibrant city and there is so much to do other than the Gaudi Park and eat Tapas (although those two things are must do’s when in this pulsating city).

The next morning we rose early to get to our pre-booked tour at La Sagrada Familia. This majestic Roman Catholic church stands proudly unfinished. It’s the final architectural masterpiece by the esteemed Antoni Gaudí whose glorious vision for the church is set to be completed posthumously in 2026. Here’s a time lapse simulation of what the completed work will look like when it’s finished.
Presently, every part of the building was incredible and incomprehensible. The outside looks like a gothic funhouse straight out of the Addams Family!
When you walk in you’re met with an amalgam of sights and sensations evoking nature. In fact, the inside is meant to emulate a forest with its tallest columns rising to the heavens like trees. Light comes through in color-coded wavelengths via a stained glass on the left side of the church, and the ceiling has an inordinate amount of angelic ornamental detail.
That day we spent more time in the Gothic Quarter, which is where a lot of the historical sites were and where all the action seemed to be happening! We frequented La Catedral de Barcelona and Plaça de Nova where nightly street performers kept crowds of tourists entertained with dancing and gymnastic acts. Avinguda de la Catedral even has the remains of a Roman wall next to the Barcino sign. Barcino was the name given to the city by the Romans, which became official in year A.D. 14.
Across the ruins are three Picasso frescos that look a lot like stick figure images on the building façade. We visited the Picasso museum itself, which boasts the largest collection of his early work in this world. And after that visit we can honestly say that he paints like a child! He would say the same in this famous quote from the legendary painter himself: “It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.”
Visiting the Gothic Basílica de San­ta Maria del Mar, a fourteenth century church, felt like a safe place to pass some time while walking around Born. And we started walking around while listening to the City Walk on Rick Steves Audio Europe Tour; it was unbelievably helpful! We found the Palau de la Gernalitat de Catalunya and City Hall situated across from each other in the Plaça de Sant Jaume. The former is where the President of Catalonia resides and the plaza is the main gathering place for national-pride celebrations and protests. As we wound through some corners following the audio tour, we found a discrete entrance to the remnants of a Roman Temple, with four columns hidden in a small courtyard through an iron-gated area resembling a jail. It was a bit too hot for our liking in that area, but amazing to see these columns tucked away yet still proudly standing after all these centuries.
After that clandestine find, we followed the tour to Plaça del Rei — the square where King Fernando and Queen Isabella received Cristóbal Colón following his first voyage to the New World. It felt pretty amazing to stand in the very same square that honored this momentous occasion while setting Spain on the path to become the dominant imperial powerhouse of the 16th century.
The day after we had a lot of errands to run so we ventured out to other parts of the city, including walking down Avinguda Diagonal — a street that runs diagonally across the city. In the afternoon we headed back to the more central area where we stopped by Plaça de Catalunya to see the beautiful fountain and pass by all the people out enjoying the warm weather. This is the plaza that connects directly to Las Ramblas, which will come into play in the terrible events that followed.
We retired to our apartment for another mid-afternoon siesta, which we both started getting used to. After a couple hours of sleep, I woke up to receive an urgent text from Pam asking where we were and whether we were safe. As we scoured the Internet for more information about the event, we pieced together what had happened as details began emerging.
At first we heard it was a van attack that injured three people and Ash didn’t suspect that it was a larger, concerted terrorist attack. Ash wanted to go out for dinner close by, but I wisely insisted that we stay put in our apartment. The whole city went into a suspenseful lockdown that lasted the entire night. There was the constant presence of helicopters overhead lasting about 6+ hours until we went to sleep. What we later found out was a van had driven down Plaça de Catalunya entering into the pedestrian zone, barreling down hundreds of people on Las Ramblas, and leaving a trail of carnage behind before it came to a halt at the Mercat de la Boqueria. The driver then jumped out of the truck and continued his day unfazed by the chaos he had just created. Since we didn’t know the extent of the situation and heard from the sounds of the helicopter and ambulance sirens that the situation had not yet been contained, we took measures to stay indoors as local authorities did their jobs to regain order.
Our place is a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas. We had been there the two previous days in a row and were just at Plaça de Catalunya two hours before the attack. With a madman on the loose we spent the remainder of our time quarantined in our apartment. Lucky enough, we had a fair amount of snacks and bottled water to hold us over till the next day as we rode out the night. The aftermath of the whole experience was a bit scary because nobody knew where the perpetrators were or whether they would attack again! It was such a surreal experience and really heartbreaking for all those affected. The entire city of Barcelona and entire country of Spain felt its impact immediately.
In Born, the Catalan flag was flying at half-staff the morning after the terror attacks, and the following three days were declared days of mourning throughout Spain.
Determined to make the most out of our time left while avoiding high-density tourist areas, we walked to Barceloneta beach. Even with events that shook the city the day before, the Catalan spirit was still going strong .It was quite interesting to read the news describing the city and then take the actual pulse of the city by walking the streets.
Shop owners opened their venues, servers sang to the songs on the radio, sunbathers lied on the beach soaking up the rays, and people walked about the streets. We really couldn’t believe that nearly everyone showed up to work that day. More importantly though, they showed up to live life to the fullest another day. In a united act of defiance against terror, Catalans took back their city. Even still, there were many weary faces and on-edge feelings that another attack could occur at any moment. More news had come in overnight of another attack in Cambrils — a beach town further along the southern coast of Spain. And, the van-driver had not yet been apprehended a full day later. But, even through their respect for the fallen and acknowledgement of more tragic news, the indomitable spirit of the Catalonia people still strongly chants: “No tenim por!” or “We are not afraid!”

Yes of course, this was just imagining a scenario where Barcelona were forced to invest in the mercato.

On our second day in Barcelona- Tuesday, June 21st, we went to La Boqueria. La Boqueria is a large public market within Barcelona that puts all other markets I’ve visited to shame. We had the honor of meeting with the manager of the market, where he took about an hour of his day to explain the 11 centuries of history behind this market as well as how it is utilized today.
What makes this market so unique is its wide range of products and targeted customers. We were told that the market doesn’t have one specific, target consumer. One could visit the market for cheap, affordable produce, or to find a fruit of higher quality. The prices are reasonable based on the quality you expect of the product. For example, if you just want a simple cheese, it will be affordable. If you’re looking for something a bit more fancy for a dinner party, the more expensive cheeses will have the quality you’re looking for without an extravagant price.
After touring around the market, my teacher split us into five groups (the leader of each group being someone in our class who could speak Spanish). She then assigned each group a region of Spain, and instructed us to go into the market, find one cheese and one other good from that region, and to meet back outside the market in 15 minutes.
My group found ourselves with a type of goat cheese and strawberries, both commonly produced in the southern region of Spain (Andalucia) that we were assigned.
We gathered in a circle with our five cheeses and five local products, and my professor (hi Lisa if you’re still reading this!) brought out two bottles of wine to pass around. Group by group, we explained what we had learned in the short time about our assigned region and explained our foods. Then, our goods were passed and shared. Additionally, we passed around the bottle of wine, everyone taking as long of a swig as they wanted.
It was a really great way to get a “taste” of Spain and to get out of the sun for a bit.
Next, we headed over to Pirinev en Boca for a traditional, Catalan lunch.
Depicted below is about as classic as a Catalon lunch can begin- minus my water. On the left is pan con tomate, a dish we enjoyed with just about every meal during our time in Spain. To the right is various sausages and cheeses. To describe a few, the dark sausage is a blood sausage, the smaller red sausages were of a similar texture to pepperonis, and the white were made from an egg base.
On the top of the picture below was a meatball with an eggplant based sauce. It was SO savory and delicious. Next to it was something I could describe as like an enchilada- cheesy, meaty, amazing.
We also enjoyed roasted duck with pears. The duck was tender, but not my favorite meal.
This is a cod dish we had.
We finished the meal with a crème brûlée. This was absolutely delicious- I now have a much stronger appreciation for this dessert after having it twice on this trip, in two different forms.
Pictured below is the other dessert, I would describe it like a fry bread- airy, crsipy and sweet, paired with small cookies that tasted like a waffle cone.
The dessert was paired with shots of a stronger wine.
After the meal, we headed over to Sagrada Família and were given an hour long tour by a well informed Catalan woman. This was absolutely breathtaking. The tour guide said that the construction of this should be done by 2026, to mark the 100th year anniversary of the designer, Antoni Gaudi.
After our tour of Sagrada Família, we were exhausted. However, we wanted to see as much as we could during our short time in Barcelona. We split from our class and used our free time to take the metro to the Gaudi houses. The one below is my favorite.
Everyday in Barcelona was notable, and incredible. After just two days in the city, I couldn’t believe all that I had saw, done, and eaten. I can’t help but feel so incredibly thankful for each day I have spent in Europe- I have already gained such a strong appreciation for cultures across many countries, and it has been an amazing experience thus far.

What a crazy (and expensive) weekend lol.
We flew Ryanair from Seville, and arrived in Barcelona around 11:30pm, not checking into our Airbnb until just past midnight. Before we headed to bed, we ate some KFC nearby 😂. But holy mackerels, their language is so different. I could hear the mix of Castilian and French but I was still very shocked at how different it was.
Buy a multi-day pass for your entire stay, since it also includes the long airport train ride, and ‘cuz it’s so convenient. The first morning, we stopped by Buenas Migas for breakfast. I ordered 2 focaccia, one with sugar and the other with chocolate. SO GOOD, highly recommend. Then we took a train to the Laberint d’Horta, which was a very nice change from the clutter-y city landscape. The labyrinth is pretty cool, but together with the surrounding environment made it so much better. We spent some time strolling around a few of the numerous pathways around the park, imagining the scenes of certain movies that could have been recorded here.
Afterward, we headed to the two probably most famous houses decorated by Antoni Gaudí: Casa Milà and Casa Batlló. Unfortunately the latter was heavily under construction and the tickets were absurdly costly, so we decided to not go in. Casa Milà looked nice from the outside. Nothing crazy though, I’d say.
Next, we walked by the Güell home, and took a(n) (audio) tour inside. It was pretty cool lookin’. The top has very nice views of the city. A lot of the interior has some Moorish influences, surprisingly, since it’s relatively pretty modern.
We had lunch at a Mexican restaurant called El Tianguis. After, during siesta time, while we were walking home, we witnessed a demonstration. We were told to stay as far away from it, but we had to cross that street to get to our Airbnb, so we had no choice… the people didn’t seem like they wanted to be violent though, and it was cool to see basically the entire city united together for a cause.
We went home (since everything was closed), and took a nap / watched some YouTube videos. Then we got ready for the Barcelona game. We took the metro, and Madre Mía were the trains packed!! It looked like everyone was going to the game.
The stadium was pretty amazing; my friend said it’s the best I’d ever see. I’ve never been so focused in a live game in my life! It was so fun to see the whole crowd’s emotions during the game. I remember Barcelona’s first goal, the whole stadium was silent, and then as soon as Messi scored (I believe it was a free kick), the entire stadium went wild! Haha, it was so awesome. Valladolid played some great defense that night though. Their goalie I learned used to play for Barcelona, so maybe that’s why Barcelona couldn’t score against him all the times they were at the goal…
I started the next day with Mass at the Barcelona Cathedral. They were celebrating the feast day of one of the city’s patron saints, St. Eulalia of Barcelona. What a strong girl she was (her story is very sad). Then we ate breakfast at a nearby cafe, and ran to the Sagrada Familia so we wouldn’t miss our time slot.
Also under construction until 2026 (so I would not visit it until then, because there’s lots of cranes everywhere), this place was Antoni Gaudí’s dream come true. The inside is so beautiful, and it was totally worth the audioguide. There is so much symbolism in the architecture. He loved nature, and wanted to bring it here. The pillars represent trees: you can see towards the top, they span out like branches. The image of the holy family is seen everywhere: in the front façade, in the basilica, and more. The four pillars that surround the seating area are decorated with colorful domes with the symbol and name of the four books of the New Testament. Underneath the basilica is a pretty big museum dedicated to explaining the construction and the symbolism behind everything too. In the left picture, there are those 4 sky-scraping towers: those each contain the 3 symbols of the bishops: the mitre (headpiece), the crosier (staff), and the ring.
We stopped by the FCBarcelona official store, and I bought a jersey (85€) and a scarf (16€). Then we sat outside to eat our lunches, but the waiter came out and asked us for drinks. I asked for a Coke. Little did I know, that Coke cost 4€. Yes, it was a standard-sized glass bottle of Coke. EEERG.
Next up, Parc Güell, another impressive park by Antoni Gaudí and two others. Lots of picture-taking fanatics here. I just enjoyed walking around it. We headed to KFC again, and then ended the touristy day at the Arc de Triomf. There I witnessed a pretty amazing duo that danced to Michael Jackson songs and a Kermit the Frog puppet playing the piano!
That night, we went to a club (I don’t remember the name) and ordered the Blackout Tray, which is like 6 shots-and-a-half + an energy drink alcoholic beverage in a huge jar (about 7–8 shots), and 2 glasses of chase (sangría and a mango-orange juice), for 20€. There were so many Americans LOL. I wasn’t a fan of the bar’s atmosphere, mainly ‘cuz the music wasn’t that great and there wasn’t much room to move around.
I woke up early the next morning to catch the Mass at the Crypt in the Sagrada Familia, the last place in the basilica that I hadn’t visited. This chapel underneath the main basilica is where they buried Antoni Gaudí. It’s a beautiful area, only open to the public (free) during Mass.
I went back home and slept until everyone else woke up.
We had breakfast at The Bagel Hood, which was pretty filling: they basically serve hamburgers haha. Next, I tried to take the T2A bus to Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor, but that bus doesn’t operate in Jan-Feb because the amusement park is closed during the winter. That 30-minute bus journey was going to turn into a 1-hour+ metro/bus journey, so I decided against it. We headed out to the beach instead, and I touched the Mediterranean Sea!
Finally, we stopped by the Barcelona store one last time before heading to the airport for our flight home.
Barcelona was a great weekend, but I definitely missed Córdoba. I’m also not a big-city type of person, and Barcelona was definitely that and more.

Before going to Barcelona, I was haunted by the thundering voice of Richard Burton who said: “the greatest poem in the English language is the present tense of the verb ‘to be’”. I was about to teach English to Spanish and Catalan students but how could I teach the greatest poem in the English language, Richard? Answer came there none, so I began translating my intrinsic knowledge of the language into extrinsic grammar rules : “I have been recording my feelings about Barcelona” I write and translate it to ‘Subject+ Present Perfect Progressive + Main Verb + Object’.
In retrospect, this was good preparation because my students learnt grammar like this; in formulae, equations, and tables. This was a shift in gear to the way I had learnt English in school, where the Latinate English grammar lessons had disappeared since the 1960s. I learnt by experience, by reading, and writing. At some point in this journey, I also fell in love with English in a similar way that Darcy fell in love with Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice, namely, “I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.” First, it was a silent passion when I arrived from Brunei at the age of five and I was surprised by how the words of the Lord’s prayer in assembly stuck to my tongue like snow and I quickly memorised its enchanting cadence. As an adult, English became the prism through which I refracted the world and expressed my being so learning the rules that scaffolded the language was an education even for me.
The few things I knew about Barcelona was through arm-chair travelling with Evelyn Waugh who visited the city in 1929 and recorded his impressions in Labels (1930). Here, I read of majestic “flower stalls, which colour and perfume the whole length of the street” and an arresting style of architecture that was more like a “stage setting — perhaps for the temptation of Maguerite in Faust, or for The Hunchback of Notre Dame, or the final act of some historical drama in which the heroine, penitent, renounces the world and becomes a nun”. I thought that this city must be an alchemist who takes the soul of a young woman in his palms and changes it forever. Whether this change was for better or for worse, I did not know. Then there was the promise of Gaudism which Waugh describes as, “what art-for-art’s-sake can become when it is wholly untempered by considerations of tradition or good taste” — having come from the drawing rooms of Oxford full of patrician paintings and horsehair sofas, it was unimaginable to conceive of an art style that was so original that it was not affected by its forebears or the views of people of ‘good taste’. With such private visions I onboarded my flight equipped, like any millennial, with Waugh and a crisp paper map.
After listening to my fellow passengers’ detailed nightlife plans, we soon swerved into the city. My driver collected me in the baking heat and as we were driving, I was immediately struck with the awe of the unfamiliar — what looked like apartment blocks stacked on the steep slopes of Montjuïc (Jewish mountain) but were in fact, a town of cemeteries built into the winding hillside overlooking the harbour. The reason I mistook them for apartments was because the coffins were built above ground in large communal graves, each with little windows stacked on top of each other, giving the appearance of apartment windows winking in the sunlight. When I inquired about the pretty windows, my driver informed me that this was a Spanish tradition called ‘nichos’. Similar to its Latin root nīdus meaning ‘nest’, the body of the deceased is placed in each nicho and loved ones usually place flowers or decorative items in the glass pane.
I was fascinated by these sepulchral niches and the hillside labyrinth of ornate mausoleums. I later realised that my fascination was an English eccentricity because when I expressed my interest to visit the cemetery to a local, she was taken aback. She explained that the Spanish have a different attitude to cemeteries and wouldn’t visit one unless to visit a relative — even walking through a graveyard was unsettling enough! I was too embarrassed to tell her that in Oxford, I would spend sunny days watering flowers in the cemetery in case they wilted and because it is quiet there, the shade is wider, and the air purer. It was peculiar how the same place can evoke different emotions depending on one’s culture so I read a book called El Jardí dels Àngels by Catalan author Miquel Àngel Diez i Besora. In his book, he mentions how cemeteries are usually ignored in a similar way to prisons and asylums because the very act of seeing tombs reminds us of the unavoidable fate waiting for us all. Yet the landscape of the cemetery felt designed to overcome that fear — the white tombs blending with the serene green of the cypresses and the lulling seaward prospect. However, after my soujourn in Barcelona, I began to understand that this fear might stem from the Spanish love of living because, more than any place in the world, I encountered in Barcelona, a searing passion for life.
From my earliest moments in Barcelona, I was embraced by their community spirit. As soon as I entered the apartment block where I was staying, an elderly neighbour immediately launched into jovial conversation with me as though I was a friend. Whenever I saw an elderly neighbour from then on, they would stop to chat with me in Spanish and when I regretfully said, “no hablas Español”, they treated it as though it was a trifling detail and continued narrating their story with equal animation. When I was out and about, the abuelas also spoke to me kindly in Catalan and patted my shoulders. I shouldn’t call them abuelas really because in Barcelona, everyone is young at heart and forever in the honeymoon stage. Couples of all ages walk the streets linked on each others’ arms and are inseparable even in the crowded metro where they productively spend the time from one station to another kissing and gazing into each others’ eyes. I must admit this made me feel as lonely as Kafka’s cockroach and my metamorphosis would have been complete were it not for my fairy god-abuelas who doted on me. Not only couples but families walked hand in hand, interlaced in each others arms. Seeing how devotedly the young and old love each other, I couldn’t imagine the distress of separation — the fear of the cemetery. This is why Barcelona will always be to me the city of love.
This Spanish passion for living is also mirrored in the architecture, which is a theatre of emotion, intensity, and movement. As mentioned, my impression of Barcelona’s architecture prior to visiting was from Waugh’s ‘Labels’ where he wrote:
“the glory and delight of Barcelona, which no other town in the world can offer, is the architecture of Gaudi…in his work is apotheosised all the writhing, bubbling, convolution, convulsing soul of the Art Nouveau…The chimney-stacks are all different in design, some being decorated in spirals, others in diamonds, others in vertical ribs…like great bee-hives, from the top of which protrude little asymmetrical chimney-pots…many of the windows have wrought-iron balustrades that are fearless tangles of twisted metal, like the wreckage of an aeroplane that has fallen burning from a great height and has suddenly been cooled with hosings of cold water”
This magnificent description of the metallic elegance of Barcelona is wholly true. The buildings indeed look as though they are “convulsing” and “bubbling” as though they were at one time dancing in the wind but were petrified by a magical mishap. Yet the toughness of the metal has a daintiness too; when you look up close, you will see the most delicate details in the metalwork that resemble tendrils from nature or the silky ribbons in Infanta Margarita Teresa’s hair. The metalwork in the city seem to constantly remind you that there is fortitude in gentleness and steel in softness. For me, Casa Batlló was particularly spellbinding because as soon as I saw its undulating façade with coral tiles gleaming gold and fuschia in the afternoon light, I was immediately transported to my favourite fairytale; Den lille havfrue, the Little Mermaid. Salvador Dalí claims that Gaudí was indeed inspired by marine life in the design of the building:
“Gaudí drew inspiration for the house from the shapes of the sea, representing waves on a calm day…shapes of extensive water emerge, shapes of water that stretches out, shapes of still water, shapes of shimmering water and shapes of water ripples caused by the wind.” (Quote Source)
The building’s façade is painstakingly decorated with mosaic made from broken ceramic tiles (a technique called trencadís) blending from shades of golden orange into greenish blues. Stained-glass windows are supported by slender columns in the shape of bones (reminiscent of Anderson’s story, where the sea-witch’s home is made of bones), and adorned with modernist floral elements. The roof is composed of large polychromatic scales, resembling an animal’s back and crowned with a cross. It was the visual representation of how I imagined the Sea King’s castle in Anderson’s story:
“In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells, that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would be fit for the diadem of a queen.” (The Little Mermaid, Hans Christian Andersen, 1836, Ch.1)
The astonishing quality of Barcelona’s architecture is that each time you walk past it, you will see something different depending on the time of day because as Gaudí understood, lighting is everything. I used to walk around the Sagrada Família at different hours of the day for it to reveal more of its splendour to me; getting there for 8am to see the sun warm the stone, in the afternoon when the golden hour light makes the stone blush, and at night when its sandstone exterior appears gritty like granite.
It is sublime to watch the morning light unveil the Sagrada Família — one shakes off the early morning chill as the sun reveals the temple and its three central ‘portals’ dedicated to each member of the Holy Family; the portal of Hope (Joseph), Charity (Jesus)and Faith (Mary). The portals are framed by magnificent stalactites representing the cold temperatures at Christmas and every surface ripples with a cornucopia of nature from turkeys, chameleons, turtles, and many of the birds mentioned in the Catalan Christmas carol El cant del ocells. The portals celebrate events in the life of the Holy Family such as the Annunciation, the Flight into Egypt, and the boy Jesus working as a carpenter. At the focal point of the Portal of Charity is the Coronation of Mary and at the peak, a green Cypress symbolic of the tree of life in which doves nestle, representing those who have been redeemed by the love of God. The wealth of detail is so monumental that it looks as though the design was carved on one sheet and simply draped onto the scaffolding.
The afternoon light brings out the dazzling colour of the iconic towers which are crowned with colourful baskets of fruit made from ceramic trencadís mosaic. There are currently twelve baskets, containing twelve types of fruit (loquats, cherries, plums, peaches, pears, apples, almonds, figs, persimmons, chestnuts, oranges and pomegranates) organised according to the time of year. These allude to the New Jerusalem, where the tree of life produces a crop for every month of the year. They also represent the fruits of the Holy Spirit; virtues borne through divine inspiration. The svelteness of the towers with their unique catenary shape are striking in their own right and house the church bells behind a series of vertical ribs that appear like bee hives. Remarkably, only nine of the eighteen towers that Gaudí designed have been built since 1882, which is a testament to the colossal scale of his vision.
On my night walks, I visited the Passion façade, which is dedicated to Christ’s Passion, death, and resurrection. In a similar manner to Jesus’s night trial, the crowds at this point have dispersed namely because the lighting is better in the daytime for photos and there are no street sellers hollering “one euro, one euro, one euro” for fridge magnets and castanets. Yet this was, in my opinion, the best time to appreciate the façade with the gloomy chiaroscuro of its angular figures and skeletal protrusions that unhinge spectators. What will always stay with me is the crucifixion scene in the upper portico where Christ faces Barcelona hanging on an iron cross with his head downcast yet his hands clenched as though to muster every last drop of strength in his body. Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene kneel at the foot of the cross aghast and covering their face. The silence of the stone conveys the speechless despair of the ordeal. Gaudí himself said, “What’s more, I’m willing to sacrifice the building itself, to break arches, cut down columns, in order to give people an idea of how bloody the sacrifice is.” (Quote Source) The fact that he was ready to dismantle his whole life-time’s work simply to capture the essence of sacrificial love is a testament to why so many people cherish his work.
I never felt nervous walking around Barcelona at night because this was the time for family — local people spill out in the streets with children in prams as shops and restaurants open again after the siesta. To be acquainted with Spanish cuisine is not only an education in flavour but also the social fashion of Spanish eating, which requires a lot of talking. This social principle is at the heart of ‘pinchos’; small snacks made of layers of inviting ingredients on a bed of bread, all held together by a toothpick, hence the name origin of pincho or pintxo meaning ‘spike’. Pinchos are temptingly presented in a buffet style in bars and customers pay at the end depending on how many toothpicks they have (therefore, based on honesty!), with each pincho costing about 2 euros. One could easily spend hours with good company, a glass of rich Rioja, and several generously piled pinchos. These places are full of local people chatting away for hours while ever new varieties of pinchos are replenished.
The Spanish love of pinchos also expresses somewhat of their love of experimenting with combinations. One of my favourite foods in Barcelona were the myriad of spiced pickles stored in big glass jars; in my local area, this was made of muscles, peppers, and olives served with ‘patatas gruesas’, simply described on the menu as a combinado. Soft, spicy muscles complimented the crunchy peppers especially when the juice from the pickle soaked into the pockets of oil on the fried potatoes. However, what I shall miss most about the food can be summed up three words; suc de taronja. Whenever you ask for orange juice in Barcelona, they will squeeze a fresh stock of large oranges which produce a juice that is the colour of liquid sun and is what I imagine the elixir of life to taste of. I had these nearly everyday in Spain and can never drink orange juice in the UK again.
One of my favourite moments in Barcelona was returning to my neighbourhood and eating on a bench in the plaza. Everything in Spain seems organised around communal life — the benches were arranged like outdoor pews around the central point of the playground which was always filled with the dizzying laughter of children. The playground was directly in front of the local church and in the evenings, the church and adjoining community hall would open their doors so that people could drift in and out like the breeze. Outside, young couples played with their infant children in the playground. Little boys and girls gleefully played football, stationing themselves outside the church doors which acted as a goal post. They would stop and smile at me angelically as I passed by. Their parents jeered boisterously with their friends in the plaza. Teenagers sat around outdoor tables playing cards. There were a few people on their own like me but they were men who silently scrolled on their phones or had a nap on a bench. It didn’t matter who you were in the plaza — everyone was there because they wanted to be among their neighbours. Even when I went to bed, I could hear the laughter of the children in the plaza and their voices floated above me in the dark room like the aurora borealis.
Another striking feature of Barcelona is how fluently children move between languages. One time when I was in the supermarket, a sweet Spanish boy approached me. “Disculpe,” he began and started asking me a question in Spanish.“No hablas Español” I sighed apologetically. Not giving up, he inquired, “Inglês?” After I said yes, he confidently asked, “where are the cold drinks?” Ashamed that I didn’t know even that, I shuffled him towards a shop assistant but his dad spotted him at a distance and called out to him that the cold drinks were further down the aisle. The little boy ran to his dad, not forgetting to look back at me to say “thank you” with his thumbs up and the most marvellous smile I had ever seen.The boy embodied the Spanish concept of‘educado’ which have two inextricable definitions in the Spanish mind; meaning ‘having received a good education’ and ‘polite, courteous’. It reminded me of Cervantes’s description of Barcelona in Don Quixote as “archives of courtesy”.
In the language school where I studied and taught, little Spanish children greeted me in English with, “hello, friend” and while I was working, pointed at objects around me and asked “what’s that? what’s that?” I replied with the words in English, “mug”, “laptop” and they repeated the words slowly with great focus. I was amazed at how boldly they were able to approach people to acquire new words. I discovered that I also regressed to this childlike way of learning when I asked people “¿Cómo se dice….en Español?” They looked delighted at my interest and told me the word and without realising, I repeated it aloud to them slowly with great focus. I learnt “watermelon” and “heat it up” this way, which emerged as per my need but I wish I had the chutzpah of my little Spanish friends to ask “¿Qué es eso?” to things I had no need for but was simply curious to learn.
The youth in Barcelona are also internationally-minded. In bookshops, it is presumed that you are at least bilingual and the tables are full of books from around the world and in various languages such as English and French. Barcelona is a city that particularly embraces youth culture; much of the young people are tattooed, move between languages, and in the metro, anyone can suddenly burst into a rap performance to a receptive and encouraging audience. No one will complain that it is disrupting their quiet afternoon, Barcelona wants to listen to young people and young people are thus comfortable to speak their mind or spout it out in rhymes on the metro. What they have to say is the concerns that are weighing upon the young and one cannot help but feel caught up in their energy, their struggles, their desire to communicate and connect.
On my last day, I laid a bouquet of flowers on the bench where I usually sat in the evenings in the plaza to say thank you to the community that had welcomed me. One never plans to leave Barcelona for good— there is always something that is dog-eared and left to do. As Waugh vouched for himself: “There is a large book on Gaudi published in Barcelona, which I could not at the time afford to buy; nor, if I had bought it, should I have been able to read it, since it is written in Spanish. But I should dearly like to have gone round with this book, identifying the illustrations and making photographs and sketches of my own; perhaps even to have read a paper or produced a monograph upon the subject.” Similarly, I would have ardently liked to visit the holy mountain of Montserrat and to have claimed a table to write in the bohemian El Quatre Gats. I wanted to see more of the sun-soaked canvases of modernist painters; Ramon Casas, Joaquín Sorolla, and Picasso. Importantly, I wanted to improve my Spanish/Catalan so that I could finally understand what my fairy god-abuelas were saying.
As the battle between Don Quixote and the Knight of the White Moon occurred on Barceloneta beach, after which Don Quixote left the city, it was only right that I spent my last day there before I too left for the UK. As I walked along the beach, I felt the kind caress of the sun and the waves that communicated, what Quixote described as, the “pleasant correspondence of firm friendship”. A passerby asked me to take some photos of him in the sea and I agreed. I took the photos of him as he jumped in the waves and rejoiced like a little child. People smiled at me as though they knew my story and I smiled back to affirm theirs. I contemplated Waugh’s words about Barcelona as the stage setting of “the final act of some historical drama in which the heroine, penitent, renounces the world and becomes a nun”. Although I didn’t become a nun, I did go through a bittersweet change — I had not renounced but rather entered a world where people plunged into life with passion, picked the sweetest fruit, basked in the sun for hours, and when they spoke, it would be, what Frank Sinatra sang of: “the things he truly feels/ And not the words of one who kneels”. It is this passion that makes Spain so unique and I see this in Don Quixote’s final battle where he fought to prove “Dulcinea del Toboso is the fairest woman in the world,” despite his feebleness. I hope that this Spanish courage to live with passion and to fight for one’s truth will always stay with me and with my dearest readers. Graciès, Barcelona!

We interviewed Charlotte McCourt, Senior UX Writer at FREE NOW, on her move from London to Barcelona and what she recommends to people who are considering relocation.
Before receiving an offer to be a Senior UX Writer from FREE NOW, I had lived in London for almost ten years. I moved to the city after school and built my career through gaining experience in journalism, copywriting and early versions of the UX writing role. In London, I had a great friendship group, was close to family and was at a stage where I was being offered freelance work all over the world; I had created a great life for myself, but, somehow, wasn’t 100% happy.
Although life was great in many ways in London, I was ready for a new adventure and missed being part of a team after five years of freelancing. When FREE NOW contacted me and offered me a role, I was lucky enough to be able to choose between Hamburg and Barcelona as my base location for the role. As someone who loves sunshine, hiking and the ocean, the decision was a no-brainer for me. The role and team seemed awesome, the company culture looked great and the opportunity to relocate to Barcelona was once-in-a-lifetime.
Still, packing up my life and saying goodbye to everyone at home was no small feat. As much as the move was exciting, there was a lot to prepare and at times, it was nerve-wracking. Looking back now, I am really glad that I made the move; a whirlwind few months paid off and I love my new job with a great team in an awesome city.
For anyone else considering a move abroad, here are the three things which I think will help make it a success.
Luckily (or unluckily, depending on how you look at it), I’m a super obsessive planner and I absolutely love organising things. This trait might drive the people close to me mad, but it was pretty helpful when it came to arriving in my new country, Spain. It meant I had at least a little knowledge of how things might work, which areas I would like to live in or how much I would be able to spend on rent, bills etc. There are tons of websites and expat blogs which can help you to get an idea of what to expect, so make sure you fit in some time before you move to read through some of them.
I did this and it meant that I could spend the entire first week flat hunting, exploring and getting ready for my first day. Seriously, don’t underestimate how hard it is to find a place to live in Barcelona in late May!
It also meant I got some chill time in my beautiful new city and meant that my first day was a bit more relaxed than if I had landed a day or two beforehand.
I honestly thought I was going to be sick when I was waiting to get onto the plane and saying goodbye to my family.
Cut to two hours later in the air and I was a vision of relaxation. Since arriving in my new home, I haven’t really looked back. I find it pretty funny now that I was so nervous, because so far this move is the best decision I’ve ever made. Nerves feel horrible, but they’re usually a sign something exciting is about to happen, so just lean into them.
On reflection, these things helped my relocation experience become a complete success. Change can be scary, but from what I have learnt, change is also a constant, so embracing it can lead to amazing new things. Relocation definitely pushes you out of your comfort zone — yet with planning, courage and a bit of time, there is no reason why anyone couldn’t rock it.
Are you considering a career in tech or changing your location? Check out our opportunities available in our Hamburg Headquarters and across Europe too.
