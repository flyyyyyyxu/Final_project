Should You Visit Vienna?
Have you been thinking about whether to go to Vienna or not?
Let me save you the trouble: yes, you should!
Read on for what I loved about Vienna and why it should be on your travel list.
Vienna is a city I wanted to visit for many years. As a Tour Manager, I always hoped to do a tour that included Prague, Vienna, and Budapest, but I never got that chance.
A friend of mine visited Vienna several times and said it was lovely, but that was all I knew. When planning a short break, I realized that Vienna was close to Bratislava and had flights to Edinburgh, so I added it to my trip.
Vienna is the capital city of Austria with a population of just over 2 million people.
Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
Vienna is well connected to the UK by flights. It also has great train and bus connections to the rest of Europe. You can take an OBB (Austrian national railway company) train to:
They run over 520,000 trains a year, and they are lovely trains. Vienna is located on the Danube River, making it a popular stop for river cruises. Cruising on the Danube is the most popular river cruise, thanks to the wonderful cities along the way.
I traveled to Vienna from Bratislava. I could have gone by boat or train, but I chose Flixbus. The boat was quite expensive (46 Euros for a 1.5-hour trip), and the train required me to print out a ticket.
The Flixbus service took just over an hour from Bratislava Most SNP bus station to Vienna Edberg, where I could join the U3 Ubahn into the city center.

Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
Vienna has a low season from January to May. I visited in March and found plenty of affordable accommodation. Some services, like Danube cruises, were not running.
The weather during my visit was warm with sunny days and temperatures around 18°C. Many people enjoyed the parks in the pleasant sunshine.
July is one of the peak times to visit Vienna. It can be quite hot then, around 26°C, and it usually has about two weeks of rain that month.
Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
Getting around Vienna is easy and affordable. I bought a 24-hour unlimited travel ticket for 8 Euros. This ticket covered all transport in the city center.
It’s easy to buy a ticket, and you can switch the instructions to English and pay with contactless. I mainly used the U-Bahn, which connects all the places I wanted to visit.
Vienna is also enjoyable to walk around. The pavements are clean and wide, with separate lanes for bikes and scooters. There are many beautiful buildings and parks, so there is always something to enjoy. You can also find many cafes for a nice stop along the way.
I used the hop-on and hop-off sightseeing bus to explore Vienna. It was a great way to learn some history while enjoying a great view of the city from the top deck. I also took a few rides on the Bolt taxi service because my feet were sore from too much walking in the wrong shoes!
Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
I felt very safe at all times in Vienna. The streets were well-lit, although I wasn’t out particularly late. I didn’t feel uncomfortable in any area I visited, including a non-tourist area where I stayed!
Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
Vienna wasn’t cheap, but it was good value. I ate at cafes instead of restaurants, and the food was high quality. For example, a Mediterranean breakfast cost 15 Euros, and I couldn’t finish it!
The hop-on hop-off bus ticket was 41 Euros for a 24-hour pass, but it only ran from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM.
Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
I stayed near the Danube River, in a less touristy part of the city, which I liked. It was well connected by public transport and less than 10 minutes on the U-Bahn to the city center.
I prefer an apartment when traveling, so I stayed at the Best Western Celebrity City Suites. My accommodation was a large studio flat with a separate bathroom and toilet. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Two nights’ accommodation cost 145 Euros.
Check out hotels on Booking.com, holiday rentals on Vrbo and reviews on Tripadvisor
Is Vienna Worth Visiting?
There is so much to see and do in Vienna! In the day and a half I was there, I did a couple of things.
The hop-on hop-off bus was my main activity. Since I spent 41 Euros on it, I did both the Red and Blue routes to cover as much ground as possible. I spent about 3 hours on the buses.
One stop on the Blue route was Hundertwasser Village. I loved this quirky place with apartments above and shops inside. The café I visited had a little river running through the counter, along with gift shops and an art gallery.
I also visited the huge Westfield shopping centre. I didn’t plan to go there, but I needed new shoes. It was enormous! One whole block was a food mall with an IMAX cinema, while the other three blocks were filled with shops. It was a bit overwhelming for me, but if you love shopping, it’s great! It’s also an excellent spot for a rainy day since it’s all indoors and easy to reach on U-Bahn 1.
There are many museums and palaces to visit in Vienna, along with various parks, including Prater Park. Prater is a leisure park filled with rides and entertainment, including a steam engine and the oldest Ferris wheel in the world.
Check out tours and activities in Vienna on Get Your Guide
I had a couple of surprises during my visit. Firstly, there was a lot of graffiti, even on some older buildings. Much of it was around the Danube canal area, where graffiti is legal. This was a stark contrast to the Museum quarter.
My full day in Vienna was a Sunday, so all the shops were closed, which wasn’t a big deal. However, all the supermarkets were shut too, leaving only small convenience stores open.

Vienna seems to inspire superlatives.
It has been, by turns, the Greenest City in the World, The Smartest City in the World (in a techie urban-engineering sense), and perhaps most famously, The Most Liveable City in the World.
It is also The City of Music and The City of Dreams (after its connection to psychoanalysis). Plus, Vienna always makes a strong showing in the list of Europe’s Best Cities (currently Number 12). Austria itself is considered the third-safest country in the world, according to the Global Peace Index.
Who wouldn’t want to visit a place like that?
However, as you begin to look up these many superlatives, you may also run across a title that has dogged the Viennese for years: the capital has also been rated the Least Friendly City in the World toward foreigners.
Ouch.
My wife and I decided to spend her birthday in Vienna this year, not because it appeared on best-of (or worst-of) lists, but because it was a place she’d always…

As I’m about to complete my first year of living in Vienna, I wanted to highlight the things that I particular like about the city. Vienna was once again elected as the most liveable city in the world according to the Global Liveability Index.
What is so great about living in Vienna?
1) Affordable and Reliable public transport
Vienna is the 4th city in which I have lived, and it’s also the one that has the best public transport system out of the four. I have lived in Strasbourg (France), Norwich (England), and Copenhagen (Denmark) before moving here and I am completely satisfied with the moving options in Vienna.
First, the public transport network covers a really huge area and is not divided into specific zones like London. It means that when you buy a pass you can travel everywhere within the city boundaries. There are plenty of means of transport: Bus, Tram, Metro and even suburban trains.
In Vienna, using public transport is very affordable. Students only have to pay 75€ per semester for unlimited transports across the city while the non-reduced annual ticket costs 365€ or 1€ per day. This is without mentioning other discounts for children or people with disabilities.
2) Decent pricing for a capital city
While I will not go as far as saying that Vienna is “affordable” or “cheap”, prices are definitely less outrageous compared to many other capital cities in the Western World. Although I can’t really speak about hotels or short-term accommodations, I have found it quite decent to live on a student budget in Vienna.
For instance, Vienna is around 10% cheaper for restaurants and 30% cheaper for Groceries than Paris. If we talk about rent, then we are talking around 40% cheaper, which is a huge difference if you decide to settle there. If you want to have a closer look at the prices variation, click on this link.
If you are looking for a cheap city, I don’t think you should choose Vienna but if you want to enjoy a high standard of living, in a good location and with plenty of things to see, Vienna would definitely be one of my top choice !
3) The coffee culture
Cultivating coffee beans might become possible in the future due to climate change but as for now, it's not possible to get ""Austrian Coffee” as such. On the other hand, Viennese cafés are very appreciated by locals and by visitors.
You will find very old style and traditional ones while the number of more modern coffee places is also expanding. If you like spending your afternoon reading or need a spot to study for a few hours, nobody will bother you and you won’t feel the pressure to order something just so you can stay more.
The coffee vocabulary can be a bit different from the German from Germany so here are some words you can use:
Schwarzer — Espresso
Brauner — Espresso with Milk
Melange — Similar to Cappuccino but usually with less milk
Verlängerter — Similar to an Americano
Of course, most baristas in Vienna will know the English or Italian version of these words so no worries if you don’t remember them !
4) Plenty of parks and places to visit
Granted, Vienna is not as bustling than Paris or London. Nonetheless, its history and its prime location at the center of Europe makes it an awesome place to visit and to live in.
There are multiple parks throughout the city, which are particularly praised by locals during the summer months. There are plenty to choose from to enjoy a local beer or a “Spritzer”, a local drink that combine white wine and sparkling water.
On the other hand, Vienna is also a prime city for history and architecture as it was the center of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. From the Albertina Museum to the Schönnbrunn castle, you will be able to fulfil your interests in culture and history without any problems.
5) Close to the Alps and surrounding countries
It won’t take you long to reach the Alps from Vienna and enjoy the view of beautiful lakes and nice hikes that you can do on the weekends. Around 60% of the Austrian territory is classified as being mountainous, so there is definitely plenty of things to see if you like the mountain vibe !
Moreover, Vienna is very close to the Czech, Hungarian and Slovakian border. A quick one hour train ride can take you to Bratislava or Brno, while you can also reach Budapest in under three hours.
The Austrian Railway Company is also well developed so you can easily catch train to Germany, France, Italy, and Slovenia. I have also used Flixbus to go to Belgrade for a weekend.
Overall, Vienna is in a prime location in Central Europe and coupled to the various transportations means, you can easily explore so many cities and places that you could ever count.
Thank you for reading my first piece about the Viennese capital ! If you are interested in other articles related to Vienna, feel free to let me know.

As a resident of Budapest, I visit Vienna frequently, at least twice a year.
The city’s proximity, vibrant cultural life, and bustling atmosphere draw me in like a magnet. Several of my friends live in Vienna, and I visit them regularly, but this time, I explored the city of classical music and coffeehouses with my wife.
Budapest and Vienna, two significant Central European capitals, have maintained a close relationship for centuries. During the Habsburg rule, both cities played crucial roles in the empire, though Vienna was the center.
In the 19th century, particularly after the 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise, Budapest rapidly developed, emerging as a rival to Vienna in cultural and economic spheres. An intense cultural exchange occurred between the two cities, influencing the artistic and intellectual life of both metropolises.
Although the relationship between the two cities transformed following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, their cultural and historical heritage continues to bind them together.
In this travelogue, I will attempt to provide a detailed summary of our trip, which will be helpful to…

Four days of Vienna exhausted me completely. The long drive from and to Amsterdam did not help. German roads were dug up for long stretches, but Austria was a little better.
Traipsing through yet another historic European city made me realise these places were never designed for this amount of people, this level of tourism, this much traffic. The city was panting in the heat and groaning with the strain of it all, almost as much as I was.
Footsore, but still enjoyed great art, Klimt, Schiele, imposing buildings, decorated walls, big portions of stodgy local food, great cakes, a varied restaurant and bar scene, adequately cold beer in large glasses.
Travelling in time as well as in space, Frances and I reenacted a romantic Amsterdam restaurant memory from 40 years ago.

Posted: 3/21/24 | March 21st, 2024
I think Vienna is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. The historic core of the city is a massive UNESCO Heritage Site brimming with incredible museums, beautiful galleries, and sprawling Baroque palaces.
The city is a history buff’s dream and there’s a lot more to see and do here. There’s an incredible café culture, a nearby wine region, tons of amazing eateries, awesome live music (including world-class opera), and much more.
I’ve been coming here for years and I never get tired of visiting. (I love the city so much I used to run tours here!)
Naturally, I’ve stayed at countless hotels during my visits. Here’s my list of the best hotels in Vienna:
This two-star hotel is one of the few affordable lodgings in the city center. It has simple but bright rooms that feature comfortable beds, plenty of space, and large windows that let in a lot of natural light. The design is a bit dated (the carpeted rooms don’t look particularly stylish) but everything is clean and functional. Rooms include basic amenities like a flatscreen TV, desk, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are pretty small, but they’re clean and the showers have good water pressure. The hotel offers a hearty continental breakfast and the owner is friendly and welcoming. If you’re on a tight budget, there are small, no-frills single rooms with a shared bathroom available as well.
Book here!
This boutique four-star hotel has small, clean rooms with décor that makes you feel like you’re back in Vienna’s imperial past. The rooms have plenty of light and lots of antique touches, such as wooden desks and tables, and upholstered armchairs. Rooms also have free Wi-Fi, a flatscreen TV, and a coffee/tea maker. The bathrooms, while not particularly fashionable (the tiles are kind of ugly), are very spacious and the showers have excellent water pressure. The breakfast, which can be included in the price, has tons of variety, including lots of different fresh breads and cheeses.
Located in the city center, I think this is one of the best value places to stay if you want to be in the center of it all.
Book here!
One of the few hotels in the Rossau neighborhood (just northwest of the city center), this budget-friendly three-star hotel boasts large rooms with lots of natural light. Rooms are spacious and decorated in light colors and feature hardwood or parquet floors. There are lots of other wooden touches too, such as desks/tables, and large wooden headboards. Free Wi-Fi is included, as is a flatscreen TV and AC (a must if you’re visiting in the summer). Some rooms include coffee machines. The hotel boasts a filling breakfast spread each morning with lots of fresh fruit and pastries. There’s also a bar on-site and the staff are always happy to share their tips and advice too.
Book here!
Located in the Wieden neighborhood, this stylish four-star hotel is named after the eponymous 19th-century Austrian composer. The hotel is set in a historic Art Nouveau building that’s been entirely renovated, with rooms that have lots of natural light and a soft, welcoming color palette. Rooms include a flatscreen TV, minibar, coffee/tea maker, desk, and sofa. I really like that there’s a lot of art around the property, including in the rooms (naturally, much of the art is music centered). The tiled bathrooms are huge, with lots of light and great water pressure. I especially like that the breakfast buffet is enormous and features a lot of variety. The staff is exceptionally friendly too and happy to help you make the most of your stay.
Book here!
Located in Landstrasse near the iconic Belvedere Palace, this luxe four-star hotel feels more like a five-star property. It has a chic lobby and large, bright rooms with super comfy beds. Everything is fashionable and trendy, with lots of rich colors from a darker palette. The large bathrooms are bedecked with dark tiles and are well lit, featuring plush bathrobes and relaxing rain showers. Rooms also include a flatscreen TV, desk, and coffee/tea maker. The breakfast buffet is huge and has a lot of options, but I especially love that the on-site restaurant has a Michelin star (it does amazing modern takes on traditional Austrian dishes).
The hotel is a perfect choice for travelers who want some luxury without breaking the bank.
Book here!
This is arguably the fanciest hotel in town. A five-star property right in the heart of the city, this hotel is spread across four historic palaces (yes, actual palaces). While the hotel feels palatial, it has understated décor with a chic minimalist design (think lots of white space with touches of color or artwork). The marble bathrooms are huge and the showers have perfect water pressure. The rooms are also massive and have big, comfy beds (as well as desks, AC, sofas, and electric kettles).
There’s also a gigantic breakfast buffet offered each morning and a free glass of champagne when you check in. The hotel also has a pool that plays music underwater, a fitness center, sauna, steam room, and three different spas on-site. In short, it’s the pinnacle of luxury in the city and the best choice for travelers looking to splurge on an elegant stay.
Book here!

I closed my eyes and thought to myself — what comes to my mind when I think of Vienna? A photographic memory from 2015 surfaced. A simple road sign where it is written “Wien” with a right arrow on a green reflective board seen through a train window. It was a memory from my backpacking trip from Prague to Bratislava in 2015. A moment when I wished I could afford to visit Vienna and it got etched in my memories.
After 7 long years I was able to visit Vienna as part of business. I couldn’t just keep it all business but planned one day out of my schedule to enjoy my long-awaited Wien visit.
Arriving in Vienna
I arrived in Vienna on a late evening. The first thing I did was buying a 3-day pass to the well-connected public transport of the city. Vienna is rich in its cultural and architectural heritage and old buildings. I was lucky to find my accommodation in such a classic and cozy place. My host had a huge collection of books and music that filled every wall in that house. Even though I couldn’t meet him, he left all the instructions on the table with physical maps of the city (which I love to use and collect).
The City of Vienna — Romantic and Musical!
The moment I stepped on the streets of the city, it took my breath away. There was something special in this city. A special calm amidst the busy streets. A special beauty in everything I looked at. It felt like I could hear Beethoven’s symphonies and Mozart’s compositions in the air. Those were the moments when the solo traveler in me longed for a company to share it with. To hold her hands and to walk those streets in awe of what we see around together.. To kiss her while those centuries-old buildings witness..
That walk led me to a big magnificent cathedral. Nothing but the St. Stephen’s Cathedral of Vienna.
The St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Arriving at the Stephensplatz which is the town square, I stood in admiration looking at the Cathedral standing tall at 136 meters in its complex Gothic architecture. A structure that was built and maintained over centuries starting from the 12th century. Most European cities have a cathedral in the city center and the city grew outwards. Vienna is no different.
As I appreciated what I saw, little did I know what was waiting for me in the interiors. Stepping into the cathedral there was a mass going on in Latin. The chanting deeply echoed on the walls of the cathedral and blended into everything and everyone inside. I was immersed in my thoughts and enjoyed the calmness inside even with visitors around. I let my camera capture some pictures of the altar and the multiple ornate chapels. It's impressive how such a tall structure is made centuries back without iron reinforcement.
The Bells of the Cathedral
The bells of the cathedral have stories to tell. Composer Beethoven discovered the totality of his deafness from these bells. He saw birds flying out of the bell tower when the bells were tolling but could not hear the bells. What a way to make the mind accept one’s own disability! :)
The church has a total of 22 bells. The largest bell weighs a whooping 20,130 kg! It is the second largest swinging-bell after the bell of the St. Peters Cathedral of Cologne. It rings only on special occasions.
I could spend more time there, but I had to move on. I walked further into the Hofburg Palace and further to the Spanish riding school.
The Holfburg Palace
Another beautiful and heritage building in Vienna — the Holfburg Palace. Built in the 13th century, it is currently the official residence and workplace of the President of Austria. We can walk through it on foot or rent a horse chariot. I could see fountains and beautiful sculptures outside the palace.
It was one sight watching those beautiful horse-ridden carriages.
I was running out of time, I should head over to my next destination- the Belvedere Palaces.
The Upper and Lower Belvedere Palaces
Most attractions in the city center are all walkable and I did it on foot. But this one I had to take the metro. A walk to a nearby station from Stephensplatz and I could take the redline directly to the Belvedere. I still remember how thirsty I was on my way. I could find a kiosk to get a coke and it was the best coke I ever had! :)
It was quite relaxing to walk from the upper Belvedere Palace to the lower one and visit the exquisite gardens and fountains around them. The skies were magical that day organising me a warm welcome :) I will rest my pen and will let the pictures speak.
The Austrian Food Experience — Schnitzel
No travel is complete without trying the traditional local cuisine. Many people think Schnitzel is a German dish, but its actually Austrian. I had a very nice Schnitzel from one of the restaurants near the city center. As always — loved it.
Did I like Vienna?
NO — I loved it. Every bit and piece of it. I still have a lot to explore in this beautiful city and I have to go back there. Maybe with that special someone, someday. Do some cafe hopping, make some love, and get lost in its streets together. Live life again!

Disclaimer : This is a long post and will require more attention span than scrolling through reels. :) So read at your own convenience
I have been extremely fortunate to travel to a lot of places in my lifetime. From the majestic temples in South India to the gigantic mountains in the north-east of India, I have pretty much covered it all. However, I recently traveled for work to Europe and it was by far one of the most memorable trips ever. Every journey brings forth some old lessons and new learnings. It reunites you with old friends and introduces you to strangers only to appreciate that life is nothing but the precious moments shared with friends, family, and other beautiful people.
I happened to visit Amsterdam, Rust(Germany), Basel, Paris, and Vienna, and each city had its own story that had to be unfolded. It was an 18-day trip, and I will be sharing my experiences in multiple articles. This article will solely be dedicated to my exploration of Vienna, and later ones will cover other cities.
I visited Vienna as the last leg of my journey after finishing all my work commitments. Vienna was not going to be on my list, but like any Indian Parent, my parents did not want me traveling to the West for the first time alone. So I was persuaded to stay with family, and I thought I’d rather make the best of my trip than sulk about not visiting other sought-after locations in Europe.
I arrived in Vienna on a Monday and spent the day with my cousin, just resting at home. The next day, I planned to visit Schönbrunn Palace and booked a tour around the city from GetYourGuide to see the most important centers around the city center or the Ringstraße.
Vienna is a city that is truly a mix of art, intelligence, war, and grandeur. Today it’s one of those nations, that is not a part of NATO, and in the past, it was not a part of the Allies but was occupied by them. Austria comprises 9 provinces(federal states), with Vienna being the capital city of Lower Austria province. It has continuously been ranked in the top position as the most livable city. It has an immensely well-connected public transport where for every place in the city, you will have access to a tram, a bus or a U-bahn station.
I leveraged this highly interconnected public infrastructure and booked a ticket on the Wien mobile app to venture out for my first day of sightseeing alone. The fun part of traveling alone is that I have the complete freedom to decide what I want to see, when I want to see it, and how I want to see it.
The Schönbrunn Palace was my first choice because it topped the list of the must places to visit in Vienna and looked extremely magnificent. I got a ticket that also included an audioguide. Apart from the public transport and infrastructure, one stark difference is tourism in Europe is well-planned and structured. Every place I visited, I had the option to opt for an audioguide which would brilliantly explain the tiniest detail of that place.
Schönbrunn Palace was the summer residence of the Habsburg dynasty who had ruled for over 600 years in the Austrian region. The current architecture was modeled and remodeled during Maria Theresa’s reign who was the only female to ever hold the position in the empire. This palace along with its Gardens is also categorised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The Palace embodies the Baroque architecture which is known for its illustrative fresco paintings, grandeur, and opulence. To create a sense of luxury, marble and gold are used extensively. Domelike ceilings are adorned with intricate fresco paintings. Schönbrunn Palace comprised various rooms that depicted the imperial architecture, paintings of the various rulers of the Habsburg dynasty, miniature paintings, and elaborate halls where weddings were conducted.
One of the rulers of Austria was Franz Joseph I, and his infamous wife Sisi.There is an entire Netflix series based on her life called “Empress”. Known to be an eccentric modern woman and a rebel in her time, she traveled all around Europe. She was always unhappy and very isolated but a beautiful woman nevertheless. She has been extensively marketed as the face of Vienna, with her kind of jewelry sold at exorbitant prices and her face on every fridge magnet or postcard.
One of the rooms of the Schönbrunn Palace contained her dressing room, where a figurine resembling her with long and lustrous hair was placed. The picture below shows this.
After I spent about an hour and a half at the palace, I had to reach a point in the city center where I was supposed to meet my guide for the walking tour. It was a treasure hunt in disguise to decode the route from the palace to the center, considering everything was written in German. After much strife, I managed to reach the center just in time to meet my guide, who was an extremely eloquent and funny woman.
Austria is predominantly Catholic with spectacular Cathedrals and Churches in almost every town and city. It was without a doubt that the walking tour would also start at a Church. We started at the Minorites Church which was a beautiful Catholic church made by Italians. Back in the day, there was a marginal population of Italians who lived in Austria and that’s how this Church came to be. It follows the Gothic architecture about which I will speak in just a while. However, the remarkable point about this Church was a grand-sized Mosaic picture of the infamous Last Supper(which of course was originally painted by Leonardo Da Vinci in Milan, Italy), but here it was Giacomo Raffaelli, who made this mosaic art piece. There is a funny backstory to this. Napolean, when he was married to, Marie Louise, one of the daughters belonging to the Habsburg Dynasty, wanted the original Last Supper in Vienna. He tried numerous ways to dismantle the mural painting from the refectory in Milan and bring it to Vienna but in vain. He then summoned Giacomo, who created a replica of the original mural painting but through mosaics. Even today, the replica is used to maintain and refurbish the original painting because a mosaic doesn’t fade away.
After the Church, we walked to Hofburg Palace in the Ringstrase. Since 1946, it has been the official residence and workplace of the President of Austria, who is just a figurine head of the state. It is also on the balcony of this palace, that Adolf Hitler had announced, on the 15th of March 1938, that Austria would also be a part of his idea of Germany. Many Austrians were also super enthusiastic Nazis. Adolf Hitler was an Austrian too.
Austria was a major global superpower before the First World War. It initiated the WWI when the erstwhile Austria-Hungary invaded Serbia in July 1914. When the war ended, Austria abolished the monarchy and became a democratic republic.
While walking through these important landmarks, we also passed the imperial library(which I visited on my last day), Albertina, and Spanish Riding School. During the walking tour, I also befriended two very sweet young ladies(in their 60s and 70s) from Scotland. They were extremely kind and inquired about all the places I would visit in the next couple of days. They even gave me a couple of suggestions on do’s and don’ts.
The highlight of the tour was saved for the end. It was the St.Stephen’s Cathedral. This resplendent Cathedral was constructed in a span of 300 years and the South Tower took about 65 years to complete. The beauty of Gothic Architecture lies in the tall spires. These spires which are visually spectacular also embody the aspirations of humans to reach God. Another remarkable architectural detail is the ornate patterns and the stories that are painted on the glass of the Cathedral. This was prevalent in medieval times since not everyone knew how to read and write, and paintings were the easiest way to communicate stories of religious importance.
With this, the walking tour came to an end, and so did my sightseeing for the day. I enjoyed a traditional Vienna dessert called Kaiserschmarrn, topped with plum sauce, which was brilliant. I also went up the north tower for a beautiful view of the city and booked a classical concert on the way back.
P.S : looks like I only managed to cover Day 1 in this article. I always wanted to chronicle my travels to Europe in as much detail as possible, and hence, I don’t mind writing multiple articles as long as I do justice to them. I will cover Day 2 in the next article.
Have you traveled to Europe or Vienna before? What was your experience?

The city has come to a standstill. Cafés, bakeries, and shops are hidden behind shutters. So, I stand here in the middle of a cobblestone street, clutching my phone as if it can magically summon a croissant. Or, anything to fill my empty stomach.
Yesterday, this same street was alive with the rhythm of the city. The low hum of voices. The sound of countless footsteps bouncing off the stones. But today, it’s as if someone pressed pause, and I don’t know what to do with myself.
Then I remember it’s Sunday. By law, most shops in Austria are closed to honor the Christian tradition of it being a day of rest. People are still, but in a way that doesn’t feel like an absence. Instead, it feels like a choice, like the entire city has collectively decided to pause. To breathe.
The slow pace of Vienna on a Sunday morning is a stark contrast to back home, where Sundays are a time to catch up on errands. To check off tasks from a never-ending to-do list. And I must admit it feels unnatural at first. Almost wrong to let the day stretch out before me with no agenda. No plan. But as I wander through the streets of Vienna, I realize something. The…

I wrote this at the end of December but it has been stuck in drafts.
Looking back it was a lovely day and such fascinating history I saw.
Enjoy!
I was thinking about a hike today, but then I woke up to rain and wind so I quickly squashed those plans.
Instead, I decided to walk over to the Hundertwasser Museum, a place I’ve wanted to visit for a while.
Friedensreich Hundertwasser created eclectic buildings and works of art. The trash incineration plant in Vienna was even designed by him after the old plant burned down.
The museum building itself stands out, and the inside continues the themes. The floor is uneven so you experience it like nature. There is so much to see inside with art work, biographical details and so much more. Just fascinating and well worth the visit. Of course the museum has a shop and a cozy café to while away the time. Perfect for a rainy afternoon!
On the way to the museum, I discovered yet another piece of classical music history when I happened upon the building where Beethoven completed his 9th Symphony in 1823/24, one of my favorite pieces of music: so powerful!
Everywhere you walk here there is a plaque indicating some classical musician or other famous character lived.
All in all a relaxing and enjoyable day in Vienna. And more reasons why I love living here.
Happy Holidays!

This is a list of pretty courtyards of Vienna. Feel free to use it whenever you are lost in existential boredom. Here is a list on the Google Maps that I’ve compiled for your comfort. The route I walked is largely based on the one that the City of Vienna suggests on their city. In this text, I’m bringing together images and human-comments (vs. mechanical nomenclature texts that the city has put up) so that you can decide if visiting these locations worths your time.
All in all, I’ve found the chase for the inner yards fascinating in its own right. Vienna as a city is somewhat unwelcoming for walks. Most of the routes are extremely functional and channel you along the lines of the facades. There is nothing wrong with it in principle. In the long run, though, it gets very boring, when your city experience is reduced to walking by the endless storefronts and unappealing coffee-houses (most of the Austrians haven’t discovered graphic design yet; most of the people working here ask you “what is service design” with absolute blue-eyed honesty). In this context, many of the courtyards listed by the city are offering a stunning alternative to the predominant city plan.
I actually would recommend this route primarily to Austrians and their families. To such audiences, it should go with a message: “See? The world doesn’t end if you unlock your courtyard to the visitors. And, more so, you can pay the renovations with the money that retail and services on the ground floor can bring! The courtyards can be way more than just locked storage for your rubbish containers”.
The Stadt Wien website recommends Margaretenplatz as a starting point for the route and I can’t agree more. It is a very bobo area, somewhat off the tourist route. So you won’t be harassed by desperate men in Mozart suits or won’t have to watch miserable horses tugging tourist families in the carriages.
Margaretenhof in its 1884 glory reflects the flamboyant attitudes of the old money. Sadly, you can’t really get any closer to the building. Don’t worry, there is plenty more around. Read more or even more
Here you can check out the inner yard rented out by the city for commercial use. As I understand it (which might be wrong, cause Vienna has a very messy real estate public record), the property is historical and currently belongs to the city. Apparently, people really like this spot for no obvious reason. So the buildings on this spot have changed one another since the 16th century. The current one is from the late 1700s. It is not particularly special, but it is representative of Vienna’s looks pre-real-estate-boom. In the 19th century, rich people went nuts and started investing their fortunes in opulent real estate projects that now shape the splendor of Vienna. Of course, the trust-fund rich babies had no clue how the economy works and in 1873 the stock market crashed. Anyhow, here is a glimpse of what the city-block planning was like prior to this investment wave. Read more
This is one of my favorite locations on the list. There is nothing particularly splendid about it. Technically, it is just a commercial street fixed into a walk-though chain of the courtyards. I guess that the contrast with a relatively loud surrounding makes it very calming. Here you can also find a pretty good vegetarian place called “Secret Garden”.
It seems like the street is currently struggling to find a format and purpose that could interest tourists and locals in 2020. Some of the stores are in the Berlin-like decay state, some change the owners regularly. It is also not wheel-chair-, bike-, pram-accessible, in case you care. Read more
This yard is very cute. The business owners, running the venue on the ground floor have the taste that expands on the heritage and doesn’t go all-in on the stereotypes. I’m curious to come by in winter and see if they manage to utilize the yard as nicely.
This is one of the typical Pawlatschenhof, a courtyard with Pawlatschen-type balcony, that some guides will recommend you to visit. This was actually an entry point for me into the whole route. I wanted to see more of the housing solutions that utilized courtyard balcony raws. This is quite common in Budapest and very common in Tbilisi, whereas in Vienna you can’t find them so often. In the current trends around indoor-outdoor living spaces, this is a type of solution, that could be interesting to retro-fit to the existing housing. Actually, some of the house-owners in Vienna do it, and I may later include a few samples of such work to this list. Read more
Adlerhof’s scale is impressive. It’s a long corridor of identical well-yards and passages. Would I go there again? Not sure. Can it look good on a selfy? Absolutely.
This passage has suffered from pretty violent renovations and door-replacements. Vienna is actually quite bad in preserving original window-frames and doors. Burglary is common here and people often opt for ugly-but-safe options. Adlerhoft has had some original doors replaced with barn-like aluminum nonsense and some of the original windows were plastered. Read more
This passage is monumental. The state of it is pretty tragic, as the ground floor is occupied by rather tastelss and careless businesses, and columns are plastered with ridiculously ugly commercials. But the bones of the structure are quite impressive. Perhaps, when the wave of gentrification reaches this place, it will have a breath of fresh air. Read more
Lange Gasse 34 courtyard is not eventful. It worth a glance on your way from one place to another, just to see how one of these older patios looks like without a functional purpose to it. The funny thing about this structure is that you see it both in the Roman ruins and in the colonial houses (such as the ones you see in both of the Americas). If you have a good read on the raise and fall of this block-planning paradigm — let me know. Read more
The ground floor of this inner yard is a wreck. It is hard to say if the owners are working on renovating it or if they use it to dump construction rubbish in. But then the way the facades have developed through time is pretty interesting. Read more
The 90s and 2000s have railed hard over this passage. The oversized floor tiles make it look like you are on a Lewis Carroll’s bad trip. The absolutely shameless signage from Berlitz should actually be forcefully removed by the city as damaging to the soul. The vitrines are full of rubbish that only old tasteless ladies would care about. Should you visit? Perhaps. Some detailing on the doors, railing, and wood-carving is still interesting. But overall it is in a very tragic state. Read more
The yards on Blutgasse 3 were one of the most unexpected finds for me. I can not stand the 1st district in Vienna as a whole. It is a consumer-tourist hell, that I try to avoid in every city I visit. But then this chain of the backyards is actually very sweet. If it wasn’t on your tourist map — tag it for a change. Read more
To each their own, I guess. I find the look of this courtyard pretty tragic. But then if you want to check out the 15th-century wall segment — here you go. Read more
Here is one more victim of the 90s. This place could have been very Diagon-Alley-like, but then messy cheap signage, concrete floor, and an absolute lack of coordination make it more of a walk of shame. For crying out loud, they have a vitrine with toilet seats in the very center of the historical town. I highly doubt that this sells anything. Read more
At first, I wanted to skip this location. Because, honestly, it is doesn’t offer much. But then I couldn’t skip this storefront. I think the reasons are obvious. Read more
Sünnhof doesn’t try too hard to be likable. To be honest, it doesn’t even care if you exist. The hotel, that runs this passage is processing large batches of Chinese guests. The busses with them unload on the Ungargasse. They spend the night here, eat sausage, and continue on their prisoner-tour. Technically it is actually a very interesting street. It breaks down impossibly long blocks of Landstraße into a few walkable segments. It will also look like you are having a good time if you post a selfy from here to your Instagram. Read more

I’ve just returned from four days in Vienna with the family. It’s a great place for adults and kids. Expensive, but great. I’ve put the total prices of things below. Here’s what we got up to.
I’ve also written about how we packed for this trip with just two cabin sized bags.
Vienna was chosen by a usual plan of looking at the price of flights in the October half term and finding something reasonable. Once flights were looking good, we checked out Airbnb filtered by Superhosts and those with a decent number of 4.5+ reviews. We lucked out on our Airbnb, it was excellent.
It felt like we did less planning for Vienna. It’s a big place with tons of stuff to do. Looking through our go-to Lonely Planet felt kind of pointless; too much to do in not enough time. The ’72 hours in Vienna’ tips are kind of helpful, but we’ve learnt over time to make trips like this an 80/20 split in favour of the kids. And we know they’ll be happy with a constant supply of food and playgrounds.
Side note: The map that came with the guide book was poor and missed off the area we were staying in, so I bought this map from Stanfords. It wasn’t needed though as the map provided by the host was better than this.
Early start for our flight but made easier staying at an airport hotel. Time for coffees, juice and pastries before the 2.5 hour flight from Manchester.
Had planned to get the quick CAT train from the airport, but ticket machines said trains not running. Joined the queue for the longer/cheaper S7 S-Bahn train and checked with staff to make sure that train was running, it wasn’t. Had an helpful message from our Airbnb host to let us know about train issues.
Got an Uber to Wein Mitte station where train would have got us to (€26). Had a leisurely 2 mile stroll to our Airbnb apartment via Stadtpark, St. Stephen’s Cathedral, across the Donaukanal, Wettsteinpark. Me and the boy snacked on a slice of take away pizza (€4.50 each) and my wife and daughter shared some take away calamari (€11).
We were staying a few minutes from the impressive Augarten. Met our host, relaxed for an hour, then spent a few hours wandering through the Augarten, stopping at the playgrounds and wondering what two massive concrete tower blocks were. Looked online to see they’re WWII anti-aircraft structures called Flak Towers.
They peek out from behind trees, somehow hidden from view for large parts of time walking through the park. I’m really glad they haven’t been demolished.
Ate at a local pizza restaurant recommended by the host. Really reasonable for the 3 pizzas, fries, pasta and 6 drinks (€65).
Distance walked: 6.5 miles
A busy day started with our usual tradition of pastries from a local bakery (€22). Noticeably expensive. Checked Monzo for our trip to Bordeaux last year; same amount of pastries were €14.
Strolled to the closest U-Bahn (underground) at Friedensbrücke. Bought 48 hour travel passes which cover underground, overground trains, trams and buses (€56).
Caught the U4 line to Schottenring and strolled to the Jewish Museum Vienna (€30). Really interesting and informative exhibitions across three floors dating back to 1300’s. Kids really enjoyed learning about Jewish Identity in the Football Stadium and teams like Bayern Munich, Tottenham Hotspur, Ajax. Starting at the top floor meant we ended with Our City! Jewish Vienna — Then to Now which included 1945 to present day. Tickets last 7 days and cover a second venue at Museum Dorotheergasse.
40 displays of eye-distorting illusion and a highlight of the trip (€48). The kids really loved this place, so did we. Hands on puzzles, optical illusions, and clever displays to make excellent photos. The staff were really helpful too, pointing out how and where to take good photos. The “fixed gangway inside a rotating light display has you clinging to the rails entirely unnecessarily” was spot on.
Stopped for a coffee and cake at Café Hawelka, a dark, broody cafe that we didn’t realise was famous. 2 coffees, 2 juices, 3 cakes and a frankfurter got no change from €50.
Walked through the Volksgarten and headed towards some brass band music. Got to see the last minute preparations for the Prime Minister of Romania (we think) visiting. The 30 minute boot inspections was fascinating.
Caught the U3 at Volkstheater and felt on edge by an aggressive man asking for money. Pissed me off as I was holding my lads hand at the time and his tone scared him. On the tube had a gut feel we were next to a pickpocket and instincts kicked in so we got off at the next stop.
Ate at McDonalds (€22) and walked back to the apartment.
Distance walked: 7.5 mies (14 miles total)
Started the day with a coffee on the apartment balcony whilst the kids watched some TV. Opted from pastries from a local Billa supermarket (€15).
Caught the number 5 tram towards the centre as my wife really wanted to see the famous dancing white Lipizzaner horses. Booked tickets online to see the horses trained to music (€67).
Wife really enjoyed it, I found it quite relaxing listening to classical music for an hour, the kids were bored within 5 minutes. Later on that day my daughter said she’d spent the time thinking about how the seats were made. She gets the random thoughts from me.
Caught the U4 west to visit Schönbrunn Palace, apparently Austria’s most frequently visited tourist attraction. It was busy, but it’s so vast that it really wasn’t crowded. Felt good to be around space and trees and greenery. Entrance to the gardens is free and we wandered aimlessly.
If you visit do make sure you walk up the zig zag path towards the Gloriette as you’ll be rewarded with an outstanding view of the palace and Vienna in the background.
We visited the maze within the gardens which was excellent (€20). 3 mazes, a playground and coffee from vending machine at 45c. This was one of the kids highlights, particularly the climbing chiming poles with bells to ring if you get to the top. The did with some assistance.
Caught the U4 back to the centre, getting off at Schwedenplatz. Strolled through the Leopoldstadt area to visit a homeware store that my wife had seen online. Hopped on a tram that was heading in the direction of the apartment to save some tired feet.
Popped back to Billa as we were craving some home cooked food. Pasta for the kids, schnitzel and potatoes for us.
Distance walked: 7 miles (20.5 miles total)
26th October is a national holiday in Austria and our host had told us that most shops would be closed but travel, museums and the theme park would be open. Children also travel for free on this day too.
Our last day started with packing up as we were checking out. Our Airbnb hosts thankfully let us store our bags in the apartment which made for a much more pleasant stroll to Prater.
As our 48 hour travel passes had expired, we strolled the 2 miles stopping on the way at Sperling im Augarten for a mid-way drink. 2 espressos, 2 orange juices for a bargain €23.
This theme park was a great place to end the trip. The kids were excited to go on a some rides and amusement games. Their highlight was the Labrynth game/ride/puzzle where they had to work their way out. Basketball was a top arcade game. Free to wander round, most rides were €5 per person.
This iconic ferris wheel at Prate dates back to 1897 and was one thing that I’d wanted to do. It didn’t disappoint. It takes around 30 minutes to slowly go round and the views from the top are outstanding. I’m fine with heights, but the gentle swaying from 65 metres up was enough to make me check the kids weren’t near the doors (€34).
Our time in Vienna was coming to an end and we’d booked a final night in the Moxy Airport hotel. At €224 for the night it wasn’t cheap, but with a 3am alarm call the following morning being a 5 minute walk from the airport felt more reassuring that waiting on a taxi or Uber.
The Moxy is a beautiful hotel, modern vibe to the place and nicely kitted out. Our family room had two double beds, each in a separate room and each with their own tv. The kids loved it.
Welcome drinks vouchers were a great touch and we had a relaxing drink, played some board games, ate a final Viennese meal and headed up for an early night. Thankfully the kids got to sleep before the guests in the room above us started their thudding, slamming, shouting routine for the next few hours. Asking reception to have a word didn’t do anything. Got to sleep after midnight a few hours.
Stunning, but pointless. Waiting to hear back on my refund request.
Distance walked: 7.5 miles (28 miles total)
Woke up early, packed up and in the airport for 3.15am, ready for a coffee. Found out that things didn’t open until 4am, bugger.
The €36 pastries, 1 coffee, 2 juices from Veganista in the airport rounded off the trip nicely.
Landed back in Manchester and was home for 9am.
Cheers Vienna.

Quite family man. Travelling, walking, camping, wild swimming or just sitting with a coffee in the garden make me happy.

Family holidays have a contrasting character. They are calm, and serene, without the excess of novelty, since their aim is a morning coffee in a picturesque square, a tour full of history and mystery in an ancient building, and a relaxing walk in the snowy center of the Austrian city. On the other hand, they are erratic — think of a cannon full of gunpowder where all it takes is an irony to light the fuse. My family holiday in Vienna had a little of everything. For those not interested in personal drama, don’t go. There will be tips and places you absolutely must visit in that frosty lady called Vienna. Let’s get started…
At first, the trip starts with the classic fear of the plane. We arrive in Thessaloniki, sleep all the way from Larissa, pass through security, browse some liquor and chocolates, and boarding begins. We get into the “bucket” of the plane and a delicate lady sits next to me. She crosses herself, mumbles things, and at the first announcement from the captain she bites her lip in agony. On take-off, as if I remember, she let slip a scream. The weather was overcast, the cabin was quiet and I, with my headphones glued to my ears, was enjoying this mechanical miracle of flight. I distinctly remember when we reached maximum altitude, where the autopilot was activated and snacks were served, the clouds below us spread out like the most tender blanket. The sun colored the blanket golden and I, with the imagination of a seven-year-old, hoped I could sleep just once alongside all those who once existed and left, envisioning that after death there is this something, an indefinite continuity.
As soon as we landed, the cold greeted us with the question of how to get from the airport to the center of Vienna. The feeling of everyone now speaking a different language always fills me with optimism. Optimism because I managed to travel, and a trip always promises a new memory. But to the point… Here I will give you the 1st tip:
With plenty, we boarded the OBB, exchanged a few words with each other, and comfortably, I’d say, we made it to the center. As soon as we exited the station, a huge building rose up in front of us, which was the mall. We quickly said we would come back someday to browse and shop; we never did.
I fondly remember busting into the first bakery we found. For some reason, I was stuck with the idea of taking a warm espresso and wandering like a true Larissa resident through the cobbled streets of the Austrian city. The same enthusiasm didn’t continue, however, as I took a small sandwich with a piece of turkey, cheese, and a tomato, and paid close to 8€. Single espresso, of course. I knew from the first steps that the city bites and unfortunately it bites on food.
Our compass was a little golden statue that towered over every building in the city. The eye gazed at the oddities of Vienna. Cars stopped at crosswalks, statues popped out of buildings and all the passers-by seemed to me to be sulking. And while the eye gazed absentmindedly, the compass led us to St. Stephen’s Cathedral. Its appearance reminded me of the Duomo of Milan, only in miniature. The roof was mosaic-textured with Gothic architecture adorned with many statues. The statues, for the most part, represented religious, humble, and fearful people. Some held crosses, others were imprisoned behind stone bars, and as you continued to observe, the eye would somewhere fall upon monstrous creatures of the night with huge teeth and sharp angles. The visit to the cathedral was brief as the fatigue of the whole day began to emerge strongly.
And this is where the first coffee was made. The first impressions were painted vividly on the white table as the coffee came down. Father smoked happily, mother’s eyes feasted on the new images and sister enjoyed just being with us all.
After coffee, Google Maps worked, and we wandered around the market for a bit more when we finally got on the metro. By the time we got home, the bellies were purring as if we were the most coordinated choir.
We ordered Burger Kings 60€. 5 burgers, some fries, and a Coca-Cola if I remember correctly. So expensive… But, here comes the good part. My family was in a state of confusion, because putting both my and my father’s incessant hunger and expenses into the same equation, the math were unfortunately not coming out. The confusion brought much thought when the father blurted out the idea of a supermarket. Our room was on Wiedner Gurtel Street and right next door was a HOFER store. HOFER was super in every sense of the word since the products were decent and the prices were unbelievable. 2nd tip then:
Of course one night out of the 3 we stayed in Vienna we ate grand mansions. More specifically, we dined at the Purstner restaurant which is a traditional Bavarian tavern. The staff didn’t speak English, however, when you are hungry everything is easily translated. The interior design was vibrant, with stuffed animals flying from the ceiling, traditional beer pots adorning the shelves, and murals of jesters all around us. My sister got the traditional schnitzel (like foam but delicious), I got beef and pepper (too much pepper), my mother got soup and my father got something like a pork chop. And somewhere around here, I’ll give you the 3rd tip:
Following on from the above narrative about Day 1, after hitting the burgers, we slept in, recharged our batteries, and then visited Belvedere Palace. This palace was built as the summer estate of Eugene of Savoy. I imagine in the winter he got bored of it and went elsewhere. I’m not very good with humor.
Before the palace, there was a myriad of gardens of all shapes and colors. A waterfall dominated the center of the manicured vegetation and some weird statues lined the gardens, separating them from the paths. After much walking, we reached the entrance. We bought 2 bottles of water, paid 8€ and with a sweaty face we poured ourselves into the pure beauty of the marbles.
The welcome hall was an oasis of art. An imposing chandelier bathed the pageantry of colours representing a feast of angels and men. There were fireplaces in every corner, and from every wall hung paintings of every era, every concept, and every artist capable of making his mark. In addition to paintings, there were also sculptures in the palace. The most special of which was an exhibition where each sculpture captured in its expression a source of emotion, highlighting the fact that body language sometimes transcends poor words. Finally, I want to admit that enough said about my experience, I don’t want to prejudge your impression of the next attractions. So I’ll just list the sights we visited that took our breath away. Tip 4:
Another feature that struck me was the fact that there were men dressed as charlatans everywhere trying to convince you to attend an opera, ballet, or even a gallery tour. I’ve never seen art like that before. In Greece, when you see streetwalkers, they usually sell you some stolen glass. Anyway, we snapped up the offer and in the evening my sister and I met up at a palace to watch a ballet duet and listen to opera. I can say that this virgin experience impressed me. For the first time, I realized that music really does speak to your soul, if only you are absorbed in it. Violin, pirouettes, small voices, and champagne made up a beautiful evening in the cold Austrian city.
Finally, go for coffee at Central!

I love Vienna! I've only visited once, but it's a beautiful city with a fascinating history. I recently read Richard Cockett's Vienna: How the City of Ideas Created the Modern World, which left my head spinning. I wish you didn't have to write about book censorship there as well, but I'm glad that you are doing it. Thank you!

Vienna is so special to me… It will always be the city with unforgettable many memories. I feel tons of emotions on that trip: fear, love, excitement, suspicion, admiration, understanding, enthusiasm… Vienna is waiting for me, again.
Vienna is filled full of first experiences for me. First trip, first abroad, first flight… I am grateful that it all started with Vienna.
I have two of my best friends while in Vienna, we explored together, we laughed, we danced (it was so funny), tasted…
We stayed in the most beautiful hotel and after many experiences, it still protects its place on my top list. I can recommend it with peace of mind. Our receptionist was cheerful, friendly and sincere. He talked about his travels to our home country, tried to talk in our main language, sent videos about our traditional foods on WhatsApp… When I look at our hotel’s photos or think about it, I feel the beautiful smell of the hotel exactly. Magical.
We arrived in Vienna in the evening, and after settling in the hotel, we went to Mariahilfer Street. Since it was the first time, I was shocked by the early closing of the shopping places. The life stops early… I am not used to it.
The second day in Vienna started with a meeting with our Erasmus student friend at Karlskirche, it was a long time since we had seen him. Also, we met with a student from Vienna Technical University who was very interested in cars and Austria.
Our city exploration started! There were a lot of architectural masterpieces… Fascinating!
I had a detailed plan for the itinerary, nevertheless we started to be ahead on the plan. We went to Hundertwasser Houses and Prater on the second day instead of the third day.
I think we give the biggest appreciation to Prater… Me and my friend really like the Before Sunrise movie, and the place was special for us. We recorded videos, spent many times at the photo booth cabin, watched… It was fun.
My friend had kept talking about Wiener Rathaus since we arrived, her excitement spreaded to me. First, the architectural beauty captured us, then a closer look… Ice rink, fancy ornaments… All was magical. There was a song playing, suddenly we started to dance haha it was silly but funny! We stood right next to the ice rink and started watching around. I tried to keep that atmosphere in memory with every detail. Kids were skating, laughs were everywhere. Also, the screen on the building shows the area sometimes, we were seeing ourselves on the screen. Shaking hands… Our cheeks were hurting from smiling!
Third day, again St. Stephan Cathedral. One of the favorite spots…
We went to gothic Votivkirche.
We had melange on a cafe has Votivkirche view. It was delicious and despite of being soft coffee served with water, interesting.
Bonus Memory!
I studied for my lesson and before coming to Vienna, I researched Sisi and watched the trio. There were many references in the streets. Understanding them was making me feel satisfied.
Overall
Vienna is a little bit over the student budget. I want to visit Vienna again with a rich budget and at that time I must spend my time in the museums, have schnitzel in a more elegant restaurant, go on the Christmas time and skate at Wiener Rathaus.
Regards, Özlem.

When I first arrived in the city, I heard someone say ‘Vienna has it all, why would you ever leave?’”
Intrigued by this perspective, I decided to check whether it was true.
After basking in a few glorious autumn days and surviving gloomy winter in Vienna, I thought I’d document my observations. Here are a few things I didn’t expect when moved to *Wien*:
Vienna ranked the world’s ‘unfriendliest city’ in 2022. There is even a Viennese term that describes grumpy locals — Wiener Grant.
I was kinda ready to meet unfriendly Viennese when I just moved to Austria. But after a few months living in the city, I still can’t grasp where to find Wiener Grant. Yes, strangers don’t smile on the subway. But how cringy would it be if they did?
Why don’t I meet Wiener Grant that often? Either it is my language barrier that prevents me from understanding all the ugly things people complain about on a bus. Or, locals are actually nice, but they don’t want “outies” to know that. Why would Viennese want to share their nice public transport or clean tap water with others?
I’ve also heard this edgy theory — that I don’t get cold shoulders from strangers that often because I’m the “right” kind of immigrant: a taxpayer, a woman with a “Western look.” However, I would like to believe that Viennese are friendly by nature, no matter who is in front of them.
I wish I lived in Vienna when I was a smoker. Locals freely smoke in public, and bus stops seem to be their favorite spots. Throughout the city there are billboards for Camel cigarettes and tobacco kiosks.
It’s still far from Greece where students smoke in the uni cafeteria but smokers would love it here in Vienna.
Another thing I find outfashioned is the amount of printed newspapers and leaflets. Every week, a giant pile of printed leaflets is delivered to my post box.
So much waste. Call klima-aktivists.
[Apparently, if you place a sticker on your post box that says “Bitte keine Werbung,” you’ll stop receiving unwanted leaflets].
Vienna has all kinds of clubs, communities and events that range from the quirky to the downright bizarre. Here are some of the local clubs: Men’s Health Club, Shut Up & Write Club, Vienna Philosophy Circle, Stitch and Bitch, Badminton Society, Vegan Meetups.
Take, for example, the Granny Square Gang, a group dedicated to making crocheted blankets for homeless dogs. Ok, I made that one up. Yet, it certainly has the potential to exist in Vienna.
I have lived in many cities, but only Vienna offers so many opportunities to blend in.
In Vienna, I am not alone in my foreignness. From Turkish kebab stands to Vietnamese noodle stores, the city is a melting pot of cuisines, religions and languages. The best thing? Diasporas and locally born ones learned to co-exist.
Vienna, like a true multi national city offers a unique opportunity — to become Viennese (if you want to). All you need is to find your tribe, greet others by Grüß Gott and not to be afraid to shout “Zweite Kassa, bitte” in the supermarket.
All jokes aside. It inspires me to see so many foreign souls fearlessly making their homes in the capital of Austria. Vienna may not become “home” right away, but it has the potential for a smooth beginning.
Locals care a lot about the city.
In fact, once you register, you can also report whenever you see something broken, dirty or just plain wrong around Vienna (there is a neat little app for that purpose). Even if you are a foreigner, you can make a direct impact in the city.
Vienna has its less attractive sides as well. There are a few things to get used to — grey winter days, unfurnitured apartments, labyrinthine bureaucracy, supermarkets closing early on weekdays.
But after settling in, you will discover more reasons to love the city — the endless array of events, museums, and hiking trails, the sense of security, rich wine culture, and cherry on top — subway running all night on the weekend.
Maybe this city has everything to offer after all. You just need to find your favorite spots and people to care about, and you are good to go.
P.S. Many Viennese speak English proficiently, but delving into the language of the city — German — will make your life easier and give a deeper understanding of its unique vibes. Don’t shy away from putting your German skills to the test. As my one and only Austrian colleague once told me, “Here in Vienna, we got used to rusty German”.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stepping into a real-life Christmas wonderland, Vienna in December is the place to be. From twinkling lights draped across historic buildings to the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts filling the air, the city feels like something straight out of a fairy tale. I had always heard that Vienna was one of the most magical places to visit during the holiday season, but nothing prepared me for just how breathtaking it would be.
Reaching Vienna is easier than you might think. If you’re flying in, Vienna International Airport (VIE) is well-connected with flights from all over the world. From the airport, you can take the City Airport Train (CAT) which gets you to the city center in just 16 minutes. If you’re coming from a nearby European city, trains are an excellent option too, offering scenic routes through Austria’s picturesque countryside. I took a train from Munich, and as the snow-covered landscapes passed by, I knew I was in for something special.
Vienna is famous for its Christmas markets, and let me tell you, they do not disappoint. Here are a few you absolutely cannot miss:
The most iconic of them all, this market in front of Vienna’s City Hall is like something out of a holiday movie. With over 150 stalls selling handcrafted gifts, ornaments, and delicious food, it’s impossible to leave empty-handed. I grabbed a cup of Glühwein (mulled wine) and wandered through the market, soaking in the festive atmosphere.
For a more elegant setting, the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market is perfect. The backdrop of the grand palace makes everything feel even more magical. This market is ideal for finding high-quality artisan gifts and tasting traditional Austrian holiday treats.
Tucked away in narrow, cobblestone streets, this market feels cozy and intimate. It’s less touristy, making it a great spot to experience Vienna like a local. Here, I tried Kaiserschmarrn, a shredded pancake with powdered sugar and plum sauce — absolutely divine!
One of Vienna’s most famous landmarks, this Gothic cathedral looks even more stunning with Christmas lights twinkling around it. Climbing to the top rewards you with breathtaking panoramic views of the city.
Not only does this palace house Gustav Klimt’s famous painting The Kiss, but it also has its own charming Christmas market. Walking through the snow-dusted palace gardens at night was like stepping into a dream.
If you love music, you cannot leave Vienna without experiencing an opera or classical concert. I managed to get last-minute tickets to The Nutcracker, and it was pure magic. The combination of Tchaikovsky’s music and the grandeur of the opera house made it an unforgettable experience.
Vienna’s winter calls for rich, hearty dishes that warm you up from the inside. Here are a few must-try foods:
This classic Austrian dish — a breaded and fried veal cutlet — is crispy, golden, and absolutely delicious. I had mine with potato salad at Figlmüller, a restaurant famous for its schnitzel.
No trip to Vienna is complete without trying the world-famous Sacher Torte, a rich chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam. The best place to try it? Café Sacher, of course!
A warm slice of Apfelstrudel (apple strudel) with a side of vanilla sauce was the perfect dessert to enjoy at a cozy café while watching the snow fall outside.
One of the most magical moments of my trip was ice skating at the Rathausplatz Ice Rink, right in front of the beautifully illuminated City Hall. The atmosphere was electric, with Christmas music playing in the background and families gliding across the ice. I hadn’t been on skates in years, but somehow, in that moment, I felt like a kid again, completely lost in the joy of the season.
Vienna in December is more than just a destination — it’s an experience that stays with you. There’s something about the combination of history, music, food, and festive spirit that makes it feel truly special. Walking through the snow-covered streets, wrapped in my warmest coat, with the sounds of classical music drifting through the air, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and peace.
If you’re looking for a holiday getaway that feels straight out of a storybook, Vienna is the place to go. Trust me, once you experience Christmas here, you’ll want to come back every year.

The Viennese adore the River Danube. Over the centuries, they’ve depended on it for drinking water, food, and the movement of people and goods. It flows, after all, through four more capital cities before it empties into the Black Sea. On New Year’s Eve and at weddings, Austrians dance to Strauss’ joyous love song for the river, The Blue Danube waltz. Even today, the river is such a part of city life that it seems the residents believe that it runs through their back garden.
Vienna has the Danube to thank for its prosperity but, for centuries, it also lived under threat of capricious, catastrophic floods. Picture Austria and you think of mountains but the skiing capitals of Salzburg and Innsbruck are hours away by train. Vienna, home to a quarter of Austria’s 8.8 million people, sits in a geographical bowl. It’s a risky place to put a city which was, until 100 years ago, the centre of an empire. Even in the 20th century, the fear that large parts of the city could be washed away was a constraint on Vienna’s growth.
In 1988, Vienna completed its largest ever civil engineering project to address the flooding problem. Over the previous 16 years, they had dug out a new channel for the river, built two massive weirs, and piled 30 million cubic meters of soil into an island between the old and the new river. Enough soil was excavated and repurposed to cover Vienna’s largest park, the Prater, to a depth of 5 metres. It would have buried New York’s Central Park under almost 10 metres of earth. This completed Donauinsel (Danube Island) is so big that you would only have to run once around its circumference to complete a full marathon.
The construction of the Donauinsel was a project so large, requiring so much cooperation from so many different departments, that even just 31 years after its completion, it seems almost inconceivable that it could have occurred.
This is the story of how the city protected itself for the future, but also that of how the city gave its people that island as a gift.
For much of its history, Vienna perched not on the straight, steady river of today but on wetlands. Unregulated rivers flood and, in 1501, this happened cataclysmically.
The 1501 flood is as yet unmatched but as we face climate crisis, increasingly extreme summer storms and meltwater from what would previously have been freak winter snowfalls, 1501 plays on the minds of city planners. That flood destroyed bridges throughout Vienna and swept farms, orchards and livestock away. It was so destructive that, in the aftermath, Vienna’s land boundaries were completely redrawn. Landowners had lost their lives or been forced to abandon their property. For thousands of people in the city, it was time to start again.
1501 was the largest flood in Vienna’s history, but it wasn’t the last. The city lived with regular floods until the 19th century, when the Hapsburgs were at the height of their power. Famously, the emperor Franz Joseph vowed to remake the centre of Vienna. In a 30-year redevelopment project, Franz Joseph tore down the old city walls and replaced them with the Ringstrasse; a wide boulevard inspired by the streets of Paris. They erected the new Rathaus (city hall), Parliament, theatres and museums in a variety of architectural styles to give the illusion that this city-wide remodelling had happened organically, over centuries, in the context of an empire which had endured for generations and would continue for generations to come.
At the same time, Vienna’s population exploded as people came from all corners of the empire to work. In the same year the Ringstrasse was to be completed, the population was projected to break 1 million for the first time. Many of the new arrivals settled in low-lying areas of the city such as Leopoldstadt (today’s second district) and the villages of Stadtlau, Floridsdorf and Jedlsee on the other side of the Danube.
Whether the new residents knew it or not, their homes and livelihoods were in danger. The first district was on a slope, meaning that Stephansdom cathedral, the Hofburg palace, and the brand new Ringstrasse were never at risk; it was the residential districts which had to be protected if the city was to continue to prosper. We can only imagine the frustration of the Emperor who had just made over his city to his personal tastes, a man who kept lions in the garden of his summer palace and had maintained hunting ground the size of a medium sized town within the city limits, when his river wouldn’t behave.
The arrival of the telegraph in the 1840s brought some relief. With the telegraph, warning could be sent downstream from Linz when flooding was imminent. A message relayed to Vienna gave the people a days’ notice. It wasn’t much but it was enough time to protect their belongings and move to high ground instead of scrambling to the roof as the water rose around them. Understandably, the citizens continued to complain that this was not enough.
The Hapsburgs took radical action to address the problem in the 1860s and 70s. Franz Joseph enlisted the engineer behind the newly completed Suez Canal and they brought the Danube under control.
The plan was this:
First, they would build the Donaukanal (Danube Canal). The new canal would separate Leopoldstadt from the first district and run from the northern to the southern edges of the city. Thanks to the weirs and locks at the borders, the water level would remain almost constant.
Then, on the eastern side of the districts of Leopoldstadt and Brigittenau, they would carve a whole new riverbed for the Danube proper.
Finally, the old curve of the river would be set aside as the Alte Donau (Old Danube) which still exists in the 21st and 22nd districts as a haven for nature and leisure.
Instead of uncontrollable wetlands, their plan gave Vienna efficient, dependable shipping channels and a wide area which could be flooded without damage to the city.
The defences were undeniably a great feat of engineering and life in the city improved. In relative safety, Vienna grew to absorb the previously precarious villages on its outskirts. The expansion of the city continued even as the Hapsburg dynasty came to an end, even as two world wars took Vienna from the central pearl of a sprawling empire to the ‘fat head’ of a country depleted of land, resources and population.
But Franz Joseph’s defences only held for 70 years.
In 1954, another flood ravaged the new districts. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes. An outraged public demanded urgent plans for new flood protection.
Vienna reckoned with a number of solutions. Bigger dams were proposed but these would have been too dangerous were they to fail. The option of broadening the channel was discussed but making the river wider would also make it shallow, causing problems for large modern barges. Diverting the river to the north was a possibility but that area was already earmarked for development as the city recovered from the war.
Enter the Austrian engineer August Zottl, the first in his guild to occupy himself with the problem of alpine floodwaters. In 1957, when three years of calm weather had failed to dampen public interest in the project, he presented his plan to protect Vienna.
From the beginning, Zottl designed his system to cope with a flood of the same magnitude as that of 1501. His proposal was to build a second channel for the Danube parallel to the one dug in the 1870s. There would be a weir at the top of the new channel, which could be opened in the event of flooding to take pressure off the shipping channel. There would also be new motorways on the banks, which in times of absolute peril would act as an artificial flood plain in order to protect the city. And what to do with the vast amount of earth they would have to excavate? Place it between the two channels and construct an island from scratch.
Zottl’s plan was complicated, and he had to be persistent to win over the planners. It wasn’t until 15 years after his initial proposal that the city agreed to start work and, even then, the ground was broken before anyone had agreed on what to do with the new land they would create.
The Donauinsel is 21km long and 210 meters at its widest point. To the south, it extends all the way to the city’s border. To the north, it goes most of the way to the neighbouring town of Klosterneuburg. The idea of a modern city presented with such a vast new area for development was unheard of. Naturally, there were a lot of opinions on what to do with the land. Some wanted to use it for a major new train station, others a university campus, others for factories.
While building work continued, executives and planners sat in boardrooms, focussing largely on the idea of an industrial estate. On the Ringstrasse, however, crowds of people, the majority of them students, marched to demand that the new land be given to the people. It seemed like the most logical solution, they argued, since the people were using it already. In the summers of the 1970s and 80s, long before there was even a blade of grass on the island, sunbathers laid out their towels on the gravel and spent the day lying under the cranes.
In spite of complaints that their demand was ‘communist,’ the protesters won. Not only would the people have access to the whole island, it would be free and without fences. No private clubs. No golf courses. No industry. Just a vast space for recreation.
Today, three of Vienna’s five underground lines have stations either on the Donauinsel or the riverbank, so that the people can reach it directly from most of the city. On the island, you’ll find everything from the world’s biggest floating trampoline complex to a wakeboard lift, Saturday morning kite festivals to Vienna’s Muggle Quidditch team. There’s a grammar school built on a boat moored to the island and a number of beaches reserved just for dogs. There are pontoons from which people jump into the new river channel and swim to the other side. There’s a playpark with a stream running through it where kids build muddy sandcastles in the middle of their landlocked country. In the more secluded parts of the island, there are also nudist beaches.
Every year since 1984 (four years before it was officially completed), the island has played host to Donauinselfest, a music festival that calls itself the biggest free outdoor party in Europe. Big-name acts travel from around the world to play to almost 3 million visitors. Most years, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra also puts in an appearance.
Vienna continues to invest in the Dounauinsel too. Wi-Fi is now available on a large part of the island, allowing people to work in the fresh air. The island is home to 1.8 million trees and, now they are established, projects are being undertaken to maximise the space as a habitat for diverse wildlife. Community gardens are also increasingly popular. Just last year, the city gardeners planted an orchard of 30 fruit trees. Anyone is welcome to harvest the fruit, provided they take only as much as they can hold in their hands.
Most happily, Zottl’s flood defence plan was such a success that a great deal of Vienna’s population is unaware of the critical role the Donauinsel plays. On average, the weir is opened twice a year so the new channel can take the extra water. The biggest test of the system came in July 2013 when overwhelming storms hit the Danube basin. Vienna experienced more than two months’ worth of rainfall in two days. The Donauinsel was partially flooded but, while towns such as Passau were devastated by the worst floods since 1501, Vienna was undamaged.
The Danube hasn’t flowed through the centre of Vienna since the Donaukanal was first constructed. Bratislava castle is built on a rock overlooking the water. The famous Hungarian Parliament building sits on the water too, as does the whole of Old Belgrade. In Vienna, however, you have to walk for several kilometres to get from the first district to the river. You can’t see the cathedral from the water, or Karlskirche, or the Opera, or the Riesenrad Ferris wheel.
But while the Danube doesn’t run past Vienna’s most famous tourist attractions, it does go through the area where people actually live. The turbulent history of Vienna and its river was never a struggle to protect its crown jewels, its religious artefacts, its palaces. It was about saving people’s homes and their ability to put down roots without fear that they would be washed away.
Now that the flood risk is mitigated, the river is more important than ever to the Viennese as part of their life outside work, although it could be argued that an island wrought by all the might of 20th century engineering technology is a surreal place to to withdraw from the pace of urban life. Though visitors know that the island is still new, the trees have grown and the paths have weathered to the extent that the island no longer feels man made. Most importantly, if you take a bike and cycle for 20 minutes, you can only see the city in the distance. To be within the borders of a European capital and yet have it be so easy to escape is a gift.
In 1988, when the Donauinsel was opened, it was estimated that 100,000 people a day would visit. 30 years later, in a city of only 2 million people, you’ll find 2–300 000 of them somewhere on the island when the sun comes out. Beer in a cooler, someone cycling up and down the footpaths selling ice cream, sun cream (hopefully) applied, the Viennese still love nothing more than a day in the fresh air by the water. And, on days like that, it must be said that the river is, quite astonishingly, blue.

All great cities lay claim to at least one golden moment. While we might quibble over what’s required to earn that label, one thing seems clear: Fabled destiny often coexists with searing contradictions.
Vienna in 1900 was a perfect example.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the imperial city of the ruling Hapsburgs and Europe’s cosmopolitan center of music and pleasure. It was home to Sigmund Freud and the two Gustavs of music and art (Mahler and Klimt ), a pantheon of poets, composers, literati, and theater notables; a yeasty mix of immigrants from throughout the sprawling Austro-Hungarian empire; the sixth largest Jewish population in the world; and plentiful parks, palaces, coffee houses, and heart-stopping pastries.
Yet as Stefan Zweig (1881–1942) — Vienna’s native son, member of the city’s Jewish bourgeoisie, and famed author — understood well, Vienna’s underbelly was in ferment. Suicide was rampant. So, too, were syphilis, cholera, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Infant mortality was high and life expectancy low at a mere 38 years. Anti-Semitism was also on the rise as was the disaffection of youth, shackled by rules and norms governing every aspect of life.
With the help of Zweig’s 1942, 450-page autobiography, aptly titled The World of Yesterday, here are some keen observations of this…

My first ever Workation I went on to Vienna was actually quite a lame experience. But let me start from the beginning.
I’m from Austria, so I figured why not go to its capital Vienna for a test run and see how such a trip might turn out, if I packed in everything I thought I need and if the travel bag I already owned would be enough (hint: it wasn’t, it didn’t have wheels and so I almost ruined my back and shoulder with all the stuff I brought with me). Furthermore, my sister is living in Vienna and so what could go wrong, having her around.
Now thinking back, I see that I even made some Workations before that time before even knowing what that is. I just visited my sister in her apartment, brought some cloths and my laptop with me, and spend a good time with her. I think at this time the word Workation wasn’t even invented yet and so I’m tempted to say that I was one of the pioneers of this movement.
To get a primer on Workations please check this article.
Now back to my first “real” Workation: There are a couple of reasons why it was such a failure. For one, I chose a pretty bad Airbnb. It was my first time on this platform and so I wasn’t that experienced yet. On the photos everything looked pretty nice, but then arriving at the apartment all the niceness was suddenly gone. The place was quite run down for a rather high price and it was on the tiny side. At least it had everything I needed: A bed to sleep, a couch to sit at, a table to work, and a kitchen to cook — all crammed into a tiny apartment, unfortunately.
Actually, the first day was quite enjoyable. It was a holiday, so I had the whole day to walk around, explore the city, and check what I could do in the neighborhood in the next days. My first goal was to get breakfast and I found this lovely place with a good selection of food. But this wasn’t the best part: I went out on this Workation to meet people and to have some lucky encounters, which strangely happened on the first day right away, basically in the first hours of the trip. There was this elder guy sitting next to me who saw that I was reading on my iPad and approached me about his own device which he seemed to have problems with.
But that was only a small part of the conversation in the end. It turned out that he was a cook, and a pretty famous one who had travelled the world pursuing his passion and meeting quite some celebrities while doing that (Schwarzenegger, anyone?). It must have been at least one hour while I listened to him — and the breakfast was good too.
And then reality kicked in. I vividly remember the first working day of my Workation: It was the first day after a long weekend and so I not only had more than enough to catch up with but there was also the “added stress” of being in a totally unfamiliar place, without the usual work gear, no breakfast bought yet, me sitting in this tiny room (which neither was beneficial to my motivation nor inspiration). And to add to that, I also needed to figure out what to do in Vienna. I mean, I was in this awesome city without a plan what to do or where to go. Oh boy, I still get the goose bumps when thinking about this moment …
Another reason why I didn’t enjoy this Workation at first was that I wasn’t ready yet to see all the possibilities of such a trip, working in different places and not sitting in the apartment all day (as I’m anyway doing it at home too, so what’s the point?). Unfortunately, this didn’t change much until I went home again, but it at least gave me a glimpse of what such a trip could actually mean — and I learned a lot from it and did much, much better on my second Workation. I’ll tell you about it another article, stay tuned!
I need to admit that the weather also wasn’t in my favor and so it must have been the third day or so where I finally took the courage and went out to have breakfast and I was so bold to take my work gear with me. Unfortunately, I didn’t have much experience with that yet and the MacBook I had at this time didn’t last very long and the external battery was lame too (and surely there was no power plug nearby). So I ended up having a call with a colleague on the iPad which was also close to being out of power. At least the breakfast I had was delicious, it was a mixture of Indian food I had never tasted before with some Turkish coffee I also hadn’t experienced so far. And then there was sunshine, a lot.
I made all the mistakes you shouldn’t make when being on a Workation but despite all the challenges I tried it again the other day and sat in a cafè near the riverside of the river Danube that flows though Vienna. It must be lovely here in the summer — and it was also the first time when I realized how nasty direct sunlight on a laptop screen can be. But it was still an enjoyable experience, sitting outside, having a lot of people around you, being able to order some cool drinks and freeing your mind in the fresh air.
What I did pretty well on this Workation in Vienna was to explore the city in my free time — I couldn’t wait until I finished work (which was usually quite late, as I stressed out a lot and got less work done than I wanted) to walk around, which I did a lot. I think there must have been no place in the city center that I didn’t see. And I ate a lot of good food, which Vienna is famous for, like Wiener Schnitzel or Gulasch, and drank some good local beer. Then there was also the time I spent with my sister, she even managed to show me some spots I didn’t see before and took me out to an exhibition of Keith Haring in the “Wiener Albertina,” a famous museum.
All in all, my first Workation wasn’t the experience I was looking for and surely not the best prerequisite to go on more such trips. But it didn’t hold me back from going on another similar trip just a month later, that I had already booked and was very excited about (Trieste, Italy, to be precise). It also taught me to plan well on one side, to prevent mental overload when being in an uncommon location, but at the same time be spontaneous and appreciate all the opportunities you have in such a city.
Most of all, it allowed me to see how important it is to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself. I had these awesome possibilities as a former employee of Alludo and it would have been nothing short of stupid to not use them and enjoy the given freedom as much as I could.
If nothing else, the trip to Vienna helped me to see what I may have forgotten to pack and in which mistakes I should not repeat again, so it was a useful lesson how NOT to do a Workation. And that alone helped me to enjoy my future trips even more, so I tried to see the positive sides as much as I could. It also made me realize that there is nothing in life that doesn’t happen or a reason.
Would you also like to go on a Workation and avoid the same mistakes I made? I’d love to help you make this trip into an unforgettable experience. Check out my feed on Instagram and send me a message.

You can’t see everything in so short a time, so I’d like to share my experience during a spontaneous three-days trip to Vienna, Austria on May 2018. I hope it will help you to explore this majestic city more easily.
You’ll find:
My name is Cyrill and I live in the extraordinary and picturesque city of Odessa, Ukraine. (I know, I know, my name do sounds strange. I like to think that it’s like Sirius Black from Harry Potter. But less cool. And without magic. And Gary Oldman…
I’m a practical consultant who provides services for software development. Principally, my services cover writing code to enhance system functionality and architecture. We were in Vienna on business meeting with my friend and partner John F. McElroy. We’d known each other for some period of time, but we’d actually never met in person. In April we started discussing the pros and cons of places to meet and came up with Vienna.
It’s not easy to travel outside Ukraine — at least until the association agreement between Ukraine and EU which established biometric (chip) passports. But just my luck! I didn’t have this new version of the document and had to apply for a visa. Delay, delay.
But finally in May, I was fully ready for the trip. I felt a bit like Bilbo Baggins — excited about an adventure into the unknown.
My trip was devoted to two cities: Vienna and Salzburg. A first observation: I made it on a plane, where I met a group of older Austrians flying home from a trip to Georgia. The amiable man sitting next to me told me that he was from Salzburg (imagine my wonder). He recommended seeing the Salt Mine Berchtesgaden. (Turns out that I wasn’t able to see it. Too far from my hotel. But I heartily recommend it to you!)
A second observation: I can’t remember somebody in my hometown who didn’t know the name of a nearby street or in which direction a train would take you. On the way into Vienna, I found a number of these somebodies. And yet, I also encountered some of the kindest people, who empathized with my lostness and tried to help me in every way they could.
The roots of my lostness came from an entangled system of pointers, the obscure locations of some offices, and a serious leak in my Deutsch knowledge. Some friends told me that there’s no problem finding both English and Russian speakers (easier to understand for me) because of the historical cultural mixture of Eastern and Western residents. But the weight definitely falls toward English. Even when they heard my pronunciation, hotel-hosts used broken English in Vienna. (In Salzburg, it was much better.)
If you plan to spend most of your time in museums, galleries, etc, it’s worth purchasing a ViennaPASS. You can grab one at the airport as you arrive or in town later. I’d recommend waiting for a sale, which happens quite often, and buy a 2-days pass online + include a TravelCard for public transport usage.
Important: If you’re not one for museums, etc., there’s no point in buying a ViennaPASS. But a TravelCard will be useful in any case.
It offers you:
In my view, 2 days are more than enough to visit 50–60% of the places listed at ViennaPASS’s webpage. You’ll save up to 33% on tickets + transport and be happy with what you managed to explore. I won’t lie: I have a sense of incompleteness, but I’m also sure that I did a lot and have a better sense of what will be my moves next time.
Note: Vienna isn’t the only city participating in the PASS program. Check the list of cities provided by Leisure Pass Group. If a city you want to visit isn’t on the list (like Salzburg for me), there are separate tourist cards provided by the cities themselves. The one I used was called the Salzburg Card. It can be also purchased online and offers same discount system — but at a crazy low price!
If you’re visiting several cities, you’ll immediately feel the difference in pricing for services included on each of the cards. Let’s do a quick comparison:
The cost per ticket to museum, let’s say, can vary from €10–20. Bus — €2, subway is around €2.50. We had at least 4–6 journeys on a subway per day and some tourist locations have internal exhibits that required their own ticket. You can imagine how the card helps in this case and literally opens the doors everywhere.
Your card starts working the first time it’s used. So think twice. Do you need it today or want to have fresh start in the morning?
Note: John didn’t have my lostness problem. He avoided it by taking a taxi straight to the hotel. No chance to experience “the beauty” of traveling by train and then on foot with my full Under Armour Storm 34L backpack.
By the way, another possibility for getting to the city is the speedy 16-minute non-stop train called CAT (City Airport Train). It costs €12.00. If you prefer business class, it’s very cozy. I was looking for another experience, so traveling the ordinary train seemed more complex but more fun.
I found it hard to find where to buy tickets. There are automatic kiosks selling them, but if you need someone to ask directions, an inspector aboard the train can help. He checks and sells tickets, so you can breathe easy.
Phone numbers. Austria phone code — 43, Vienna — 1, Salzburg — 662. E.g. +43 662, +43 1 etc. Don’t forget to enable foreign roaming for your mobile operator, although nowadays, it’s usually done automatically.
Emergency calls. Firefighters — 122, Police — 133, Ambulance — 144. It was surprising not seeing any police in cities. In Salzburg, right outside the train station, a police car arrived and lots of people reacted as if it was some kind of miracle.
Toilets. There are cabins usually near parks or crowded areas. They cost around €0.50. Scrooges can find salvation in McDonalds or other fast foods shops.
Café Central. If you’re looking for a cafe with a rich historical past, Café Central is the place to go. In the early years of the twentieth century, the Austro-Hungarian police turned a blind eye to Vienna’s expat enemies of the tsar. They even supported them. And you’d find these dissidents gathered at Café Central. Trotsky lived in Vienna longer than others — from 1907–1914. His son was born here. Trotsky’s regular interlocutor at the cafe was the psychoanalyst Alfred Adler. (Sigmund Freud, one of Vienna’s most famous citizens, refused to visit Café Central, because of his long-standing dislike of Adler.) Joseph Stalin, who arrived in the city in 1913, met his future political opponent Trotsky at the cafe. Lenin also visited Vienna in 1913 and printed 50,000 anti-tsar leaflets there. So there’s a LOT of history at the Café Central. Unfortunately, we didn’t get inside, because it was overcrowded. But the whole district around the cafe definitely catches your attention. Each building, each sign speaks for itself.
Art History Museum and it’s cafe. We didn’t have a chance to visit this famous spot, even though we were staying just a block away. But don’t mind my neglect. The museum and the cafe totally worth your attention. The whole place is huge, and you’ll probably spend several hours exploring its exhibits. I love in-museum cafe! It operates seven days a week from 10AM -5PM and offers a gourmet evening on Thursdays 6:30PM- 10PM. You’ll probably have to make a booking by calling +43 (0)50 876–1001.
Shoes. Shoes are a big thing in Vienna. I don’t know why but they are. Shoe stores can be found all over the place, and personally I couldn’t help but stop and check out some of them.
The city is divided into several areas. The map below helps to explain them more quickly and points at interesting spots.
It depends on how you’re allocating your time, but I recommend exploring the Center and Ring (1). If you have more time, definitely spend half your day at the beautiful Schonbrunn park (4) and on your return (assuming that you’re staying in the center city) visit Belvedere palace (3). These are the top spots that you really have to see. Everything else is optional and can be done next time you decide to visit Vienna again.
Old city or the First district. This is basically the center of the city, where almost everything is situated. It’s surrounded with the circle of boulevards called Ring, where you’ll find the The Art History Museum, Hofburg (you’ll pass it often ), Vienna State Opera, and Museum district.
Another side note: I remember watching a TV show once, where a city-guide gave personal tips on traveling. Great tip: If an owner is standing near the entrance of his or her restaurant and personally invites you inside, the food is sure to be awful there. We went against this advice only once (when we had to). But it’s worth heeding, although food in Vienna is really quite good, on the whole.
Back to the city center: You’ll know that you’re here, because the streets start to narrow. Massive buildings loom over you, and you get lost in a labyrinth of small courtyards. Because there were a lot of tourists, it feels like everyone’s gathered into a single, uncharted voyage.
Also in the city center, you’ll find that you can use services of one of the bike-for-rent companies. That really speeds up traveling. We used O-Bike. We installed their application, paid for sign up, and off we went. Believe me, it’s worth the money.
If you walk from the center clockwise, let’s say from the Stadtpark (between Stadtpark and Vienna Mitte subway stations, or from St. Stephen’s Cathedral), you’ll reach a suburban area. It’s worth moving in that direction, because this way you’ll discover lots of interesting places simply by walking aimlessly around the streets. (Nothing like aimless walking for making discoveries!)
Because we were on wheels, we were able to make a fairly wide circle, riding around the Danube riverfront near the house of Hundertwasserhaus (a pretty, colorful house with trees on the roof) and then turning counterclockwise in the direction of the Prater amusement park. The ferris wheel is famous because it’s at the center of the climactic scene in Carol Reed’s The Third Man. My companions were super excited to see it.
Afterward our plans for the evening changed, and we separated for a few hours. My primary goal was getting to the Danube Tower — the highest point in the city (around 252 meters). There’s a rotating panoramic restaurant which serves tasty Austrian strudel. Imagine my disappointment after I reached this place, passing a lovely family park and UN building, and finding out that was closed for reconstruction! Oh man . . .
A reminder: we visited Vienna in May, 2018. So I really hope, for the sake of new travelers, that it’s already reconstructed and better than ever. The view promised from that height should be unforgettable!
In case you’ll move into direction of area (3), you’ll discover the unremarkable Haus Wittgenstein along with the truly interesting historical monument, the baroque Belvedere palace. You’ll be able to find more materials about tourist spots in my next story chapters.
As an appetizer: I’d like to share a small note from a native citizen. Location of cozy restaurant, not far from the center of the city (near the Freud Museum) at Berggasse 24, serving simple but very delicious peasant food. It’s called Gasthaus Rebhuhn.
We have smaller portions at home, so think twice before order two dishes. I had Schnitzel — fried chicken steak (house specialty) and potato salad. Schnitzel was very dry, crispy and took the whole plate (don’t forget to have beer or wine). Salat was sweet and had original flavor in it. White wine should better emphasize the taste. Menu is very diverse, but this place is known for their Schnitzel which why it’s worth tasting one. Time flies by while you have a friendly chat supported by atmosphere of mysterious and welcoming Vienna. Guten Appetit!

At least its not Bratislava
We went to Vienna mid-August of 2019. I’ve been there previously two years ago but now we opted to go together. As you’ll no doubt discover we’re both passive-ish tourists. Not that we won’t be out for the entire day when we’re abroad but often our days would start past 12pm and we’ll find ourselves taking an Uber rather than running since 6am with five backpacks. Maybe that’s to come in a few years but for now its comfortable beds all the way.
It’s not everyone’s cup of tea but if you’re into arts, Baroque European architecture and a strudel or two then its the place to be. Unlike places like Rome or Paris, Vienna doesn’t suffer from swarms of tourism. Don’t get me wrong it’s not dead on the streets but if you’re used to lining up for 6 hours to get into The Colosseum you will be pleasantly surprised having to wait 10 or so minutes to get into most major attractions.
So what about museums? There are plenty of those. I had a leaflet that listed 50 or so but I looked it up and there are a 100 plus. You can pick what you’d like from Royal apartments, natural history or horses there is plenty for everyone apart from people who don’t like museums. If that’s you then go to the Film Museum as its closed for the summer.
Since Vienna is in Austria and Austria is German you can’t avoid the art college crowd. Thankfully they keep to themselves here and only provide Vienna with modern art and overpriced food. If you would like to spend 25 euros on a porridge and a smoothie Ilona would recommend Superfood Deli.
The entire city centre is littered with good shops from the fanciest H&M building to your average Saint Laurent. There is also a very large shopping street slightly outside the centre for more regular things like Esprit and mymuesli.
However if you want IQOS cigarettes like Ilona then you will have to take a train to Bratislava (which we did).
Vienna has one of the most reliable Metro systems we’ve been to. For 17 euros you can get an unlimited travel pass for a week (7 days). This includes the metro, trams, buses, all that stuff. Everything is very well connected. Vienna also has Uber and Uber with Lime integration. That’s their electric scooters. There are also other brands that do the scooter service but we use Uber so here we are.
Vienna has the first Hard Rock cafe we tried in Europe that wasn’t greasy. And to be honest with the most polite staff too. Plachuttas Gasthaus zur Oper is another great place, we went for Schnitzel. For amazing Apple Strudel a good place to go would be Residence Cafe and Restaurant which is right next to Schönbrunn Palace. Sacher cake is also a must try! Ok it’s just chocolate cake but its a really really good chocolate cake.
What if you realise 25 euro porridge is not your cup of tea? What do you do then? You run to your nearest Billa supermarket and grab a poppy seed Strudel to fill you up with goodness.
You can also find your usual Spar and a re-branded Aldi but you won’t have to make that hard choice as all places are always well stocked with good food that’s well priced. Also they have some great sausages.
Honorable mention: I got a muesli with milk and a yogurt, both were under 80 cents.
This time we got an AirBNB. It was perfect. Was hosted by a lovely chap called Christian, who was more enthusiastic than most hotel staff I encountered. The apartment was 3min from one of the main shopping streets and metro and we slept with the windows open because it was so quiet.
We give Vienna a solid 9/10
Ok bye thank you.

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

Living in the world’s most liveable city comes with its own challenges! Vienna is one of the best cities in the world, however, it has lots of space for improvement — especially when it comes to digitalization.
Austrians love their Euro bills and coins and won’t replace them completely with digital payment solutions anytime soon. More and more businesses are adapting to the digital movement, however, you can’t leave the house completely without Cash. You always need to think about carrying some Euros with you as money businesses still require you to pay in cash.After talking to some business owners we agreed that there is only one main reason for the slow adaption:
High commissions for digital payments and it’s not sustainable for businesses to allow customers to pay lower amounts with cards. Business owners pay a fixed rate of 25 cents to 45 cents per transaction PLUS a percentage of the transaction sum. It totally makes sense from a business point of view to allow card payments only for bigger transactions.
Once we started traveling a lot we started to appreciate these long opening hours in other countries. Shops in Austria are only open 6 days a week from around 7 AM to 8 PM and are closed on Sundays. When I say closed, I mean completely closed. No grocery shopping on Sundays and Holidays. There are some exceptions at main train stations and airports, but these are crowded and aren’t really meant for regular shopping.
If you’re moving to Vienna, coming from a country with strong small-talk culture, you might experience the holy private space of Viennese quite early.Privacy is one of the most important assets here in Vienna and you don’t exchange this information with strangers. Like many other topics, it has its pros and cons, and there is no right or wrong. However, that’s something that I’m missing here in Vienna. I’m originally from Iran and small talk is part of our culture. Talking to strangers without invading their personal space is totally normal, which is in most cases a very nice experience and it’s boosting your mood automatically. Of course, there are also negative experiences but I think in general it’s a good thing and is more a cultural thing, so it can’t be adapted that fast.
The older you get the more complicated it gets to meet with your friends or loved ones. That’s why I’m a big fan of flexibility and spontaneity. Meeting loved ones shouldn’t become rocket science and you should be able to meet them whenever you feel the desire. Everybody is or acts super busy and opens their online calendar when you want to schedule an appointment. That’s maybe a point which most people don’t consider as a problem, but I think you only realize it once you experienced the opposite. Planning is healthy and everybody should do a little bit of planning, but don’t forget to live the moments and make space for some flexibility. If you’re a spontaneous person feel free to be a good example when living in Vienna :)
If you’re a handy person and love repairing your fridge, washing machine, pipes, and other home projects, then this point is not for you. But if you’re like me and have two left hands and need help to repair all of these things, then Vienna will welcome you with very high costs.To give you an example: The ice-maker of our fridge is broken for two years now and tried to fix it with YouTube videos, but didn’t succeed yet. So the problem is not that I’m greedy and don’t want to spend 100–150 euros to repair it. The main problem is that at the beginning you don’t really get a clear picture of the upcoming costs, because you pay only 100 € for the technician to arrive and have a look at the root cause. If you’re lucky the technician finds the root cause and replaces it for you right away. But if not, you could end up paying around 500€ for new parts and replacement costs. Labor is very expensive in Austria and it has the effect that many people try to repair everything by themselves, which has a nice side effect. You get handier and gain new experiences :)
We have also a YouTube Video on the same topic! Feel free to watch it and let us know in the comments below what annoys you most about your city.

I recently visited a Louis Vuitton store in Vienna, and honestly, it was an experience I won’t forget anytime soon. Here’s a casual rundown of what I saw and how each little detail was clearly designed to give you that luxury vibe, all while using clever marketing strategies that make you feel extra special.
As soon as we got there, we noticed that only a handful of people were let in at a time — if someone left, only then would someone else get a chance to step inside. This controlled entry isn’t just about keeping the crowd at bay; it’s a smart scarcity tactic. By limiting the number of guests, LV makes you feel like you’re part of an exclusive club, boosting that “I’m really getting something special” feeling.
Right at the door, a friendly doorman greeted us with a big smile. Moments later, a staff member came up, asked for our name, and asked what we were after. It felt super personal — like they were really interested in making sure we had a great time. This personal touch is all about relationship marketing; they want you to feel known and valued, not just like another face in the crowd.
While wandering around in the store, we noticed every item was displayed with gorgeous lighting and plenty of space. Each product got its own spotlight, which made them look extra tempting. This kind of visual merchandising is a classic move to trigger those impulse buys — making everything look so exclusive and high quality that you just want to take it home.
At one point, we had our eye on a particular bag, but it was behind a counter with a staff member busy chatting with someone else. We waited a bit, and when we asked to see it, she casually said, “I’m busy right now, but if you’re on our list, someone will be with you soon.” It was clear that they’re all about consultative selling — taking their time so every customer feels important rather than rushed.
When we were about to leave, a man with a tablet approached and confirmed our name, saying someone would assist us shortly (not only he had our names but probably realised that we were leaving as no one was attending us). Then, he assigned another staff member who, introduced herself and led us to a cozy seating area. Firstly she asked if we would like water, tea, or champagne. Serving a drink might seem like a small gesture, but it’s a clever way to build trust through the reciprocity principle — making you feel that the experience is all about taking care of you. She also asked some very basic but important discovery questions like what we were looking for, is there anything we found, are we looking to buy a bag for a specific occasion or in general and then casually slipping in between the conversation that not all products are displayed so we can ask for some more products in case we do not manage to zero in on something.
Out of our 3 shortlisted bags she showed us the bags one at a time and allowed us to ‘try’ each bag , diving into details about each one — talking about colour, how it would work for different occasions, and even how exclusive it was — all without mentioning the price until we asked. Not only that she tactfully during the conversation mentioned how we can save taxes, without making us feel offended. A neat trick in luxury marketing: keeping the focus on the quality and the experience, not just the cost.
When it looked like we were not ready to decide on the bag we have shortlisted, she immediately offered to show us another option that might be a better fit for our taste. This kind of adaptive, consultative approach really makes you feel taken care of.
And then, just when we thought we were done, and about to leave without the bag (obviously because we came in for window shopping & experience), we asked if the bag could be delivered to us at our hotel. She confirmed it right away and then casually mentioned that she’d be going on vacation the day after next day and would only be available until 6:30 PM tomorrow. This little nudge of urgency was so subtle but effective — it made me feel like we needed to act soon without ever feeling pressured.
Throughout our visit, she never once pushed us to buy something. Instead, she let us enjoy the experience — showing one bag at a time, giving us all the details, and making us feel like we were the only customer that mattered. And when we asked for more water before leaving, she was right there with a tray, rounding off the experience with that extra touch of courtesy.
All in all, our trip to Louis Vuitton in Vienna was a perfect blend of luxury, personal attention, and smart marketing that makes you not just a buyer, but part of an exclusive experience. It’s clear why LV is a legend in luxury retail — every detail is designed to make you feel like you’re part of something truly special.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that, so we took a train from Bratislava to Vienna. The ride was only 60 minutes long, and both of us took the opportunity to read. I was close to finishing Atlas Shrugged and wanted to savor the final pages. Sitting next to Caroline, I was able to do that. Somehow, the silence we shared during that ride was just as romantic as the previous night. Neither of us needed to fill the air with words just for the sake of it. That’s a quality I love in not just women, but all people. Being able to shut the fuck up shows a security in one’s self.
The train station wasn’t far from the downtown area of the city, so we walked around to look for a hostel. We had no luck. When we finally got too tired to carry our bags, we stopped in a bar. We drank whatever the bartender suggested, some local beer I’m sure. That part alludes me. I usually remember what I drink in every bar. I won’t be able to tell you who was there with me, but I almost always know what I was drinking. What I do remember though, is that David Hasselhoff’s music was playing the entire time. I hated it from the jump, but had no clue who the artist was.
“What is this garbage we’re listening to?” I asked Caroline.
“It’s David Hasselhoff.”
“That’s crazy! In America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch.”
“Are you being serious right now?” She asked, incredulously.
“Yeah, the same exact name.”
“IT’S THE SAME PERSON, YOU DODO.”
“Wait, so he’s a musician too?”
“This is blowing my mind,” she said. “He’s like the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He has more than 20 albums.”
“Ok, now you’re blowing my mind.”
“And, we have Baywatch in Australia too. I don’t live on the moon.”
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. The fact remains though, that shit was painful to listen to. His music sounds like a knock off of Depeche Mode, but more robotic and cheesy. Luckily, while sitting at the bar, we met a few fellow backpackers. You can find the answers to most problems in a bar. You can find the causes too. They were nice enough to walk us over to the nearby hostel they were staying at. Fortunately, there were rooms available.
It was one of the nicest hostels I’d seen up until that point. There were multiple recreation areas, along with a courtyard that had one of those chessboards with foot-tall pieces. I taught Caroline chess there. The kitchen was really nice too. There were even nice wooden tables to sit at while we enjoyed the free breakfast provided each day. It was a nice change from having to eat standing up. The only thing they didn’t have was a bar, otherwise it was perfect.
I finished my book that afternoon in the courtyard while sitting next to Caroline. I felt emotional putting it down for the last time. By then the pages were completely worn down and both covers were gone. It looked like it had been through a war, and maybe it had, considering it was a late 60’s edition that I’d bought near Washington Square Park a few months prior.
I’d already finished all of Ayn Rand’s books at that point and needed more words to burn through. Instead of reading though, I decided to write some letters. I’d bought some cool, vintage airmail envelopes (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border) in Amsterdam and really wanted to use them. I got some paper there too. For me, at the time, it was all about thin paper. Whenever I found it I had to buy it. I wanted the stuff as thin as a newspaper. I also knew I’d potentially write a book about the trip one day and wanted some documentation. I made copies of the letters by hand before sending them.
Caroline and I weren’t staying in the same room that night, so when I was done writing I said goodnight and went to bed. It was the earliest I’d gone to bed throughout the whole trip.
The next day, I woke up and took a walk by myself. I just wanted to explore and enjoy the nice spring weather, no plans at all. Again, museums were out of the question, so I just popped some Adderall and let my feet guide me. I could wander for miles on Adderall. I could do anything for hours on it really.
After a bit, I found myself in an outdoor shopping mall. While I was window shopping I faintly heard the sound of the Wu-Tang Clan song Triumph playing in a nearby store. When I looked to my right, it all made sense. It was a skate shop. I entered looking like one of the Goonies after they found One-Eyed Willy’s dabloons.
A guy who worked there was standing in the doorway. I said to him,“You have no clue how good it feels to hear Wu out in the wild. I’m from America and damn have I been missing hip hop. I thought all you guys played in this country was David Hasselhoff.”
“Haha, we listen to other stuff,” he told me, in better English than I expected.
“I’m going to a Raekwon show in Amsterdam next week.”
“Really?!”
“Yeah, I was already there a couple weeks ago, but I can’t miss this show. Plus, I need to buy more weed.”
“I can sell you some.”
I told you, drugs come to me.
I paid him 60 Euros for a quarter ounce of above par weed, and he gave it to me right in the store. I thought about buying some Nike Dunks as a good gesture, but thought otherwise after seeing the prices. I never understood people who spend all of their money on shoes. Then again, I spend all my money on weed, so…
We shook hands and said goodbye.
“If I ever come back to Vienna, this will be my first stop.”
“Cheers.”
When I returned to the Hostel, Caroline was there.
“What’s up lady?” I asked, playfully.
“I heard about a good bar that’s in walking distance. Some guy over there told me about it. He described it as weird and completely empty.”
“Perfect.”
“It is, right?”
“I meant you. You’re just perfect.”
“Aww, you make me blush, John McEnroe.”
“Please…”
The bar was everything the guy said it was. It looked more like an empty Chili’s than a bar. There were way too many booths, and the bar only sat 6. Normally, I’d sit at the bar in that situation but Caroline didn’t want to take the chance of getting stuck with an English speaking ex-pat blabber of a bartender.
Beers turned into Sambuca shots very quickly. She was the one ordering this time, and I was certain she was trying to ply me with enough liquor so I’d finally make a move on her. Obviously, it worked. A man can only be so strong, even the best ones.
We disappeared one after the other into the men’s bathroom, as to deceive the bartender into thinking it was a normal bathroom run. Again, very Danny Ocean of me.
We started kissing as soon as she opened the door. Then I put her on top of the sink and… Well, the rest I’ll leave to your imagination.
After a few minutes of fun, we fixed our clothes and left the bathroom. I can’t be sure of the reason but as soon as the bartender saw us, he asked us to pay our tab and leave. As I told you before, being asked to leave is way different than being thrown out.
We kissed and fondled each other on the walk back to the hostel. I hadn’t experienced that since college. I don’t know if there’s anything better then a fondle walk. It really makes you feel like a teenager again.
When we got to the hostel, we sat and chatted before going to bed.
“I think I want to go to Germany tomorrow. Do you want to come with?” I asked her.
“I don’t think so. I want to stay here longer and see museums.”
She was doing what I did to her, making me wait.
“I understand.”
We hugged, then stared at each other, our arms still intertwined. Neither of us needed words to express what we felt. We spent five magical days together. It didn’t need to be anything more than that. We were both content.
“Goodnight, pretty lady.”
“Goodnight, Mr. McEnroe. See you when I see you.”

The Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics: Distinctions and Parallels in Vienna’s Intellectual Landscape,https://medium.com/@JoshuaDGlawson/the-vienna-circle-and-the-austrian-school-of-economics-distinctions-and-parallels-in-viennas-29187e19089e,"Sign up

Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a vibrant center of intellectual activity, nurturing diverse schools of thought that would leave a lasting impact on philosophy, economics, and the social sciences.
Two of the most significant intellectual movements to emerge from this environment were the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics.
While both were products of the same cultural milieu, they differed significantly in their objectives, methodologies, and areas of focus. However, they also shared certain parallels that make their comparison intriguing.
The Vienna Circle emerged in the early 20th century, primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, as a group of philosophers and scientists committed to the development of logical positivism (or logical empiricism). Their main concern was the logical analysis of scientific knowledge, with a focus on distinguishing between meaningful and meaningless statements. They sought to apply rigorous logical and mathematical methods to philosophy, with the goal of eliminating metaphysics and focusing on empirically verifiable statements.
Key figures in the Vienna Circle included Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath, who collectively aimed to create a unified scientific language grounded in empirical evidence. The Vienna Circle was particularly influenced by philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ernst Mach, David Hume, and logicians like Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Their work laid the foundation for much of 20th-century analytic philosophy.
In contrast, the Austrian School of Economics originated in the late 19th century with Carl Menger, whose 1871 work Principles of Economics introduced the concept of marginal utility. This school focused on economics, emphasizing individual human action, subjective value, and the limitations of central planning.
Unlike the Vienna Circle, which was preoccupied with logical analysis and the philosophy of science, the Austrian School concentrated on understanding market processes, capital theory, and the dynamics of economic systems.
Prominent figures of the Austrian School included Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek. Their work contributed to key economic concepts such as praxeology (the study of human action), critiques of socialism, and the importance of price signals in a market economy.
One of the most significant distinctions between the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics lies in their respective methodologies.
The Vienna Circle championed logical empiricism and verificationism. They believed that the meaning of a statement could only be established if it could be empirically verified or if it was a tautology in logic. This focus on empirical verification and the rejection of metaphysics led them to develop complex systems of logical analysis and to apply the methods of the natural sciences to philosophical problems.
In contrast, the Austrian School relied on methodological individualism and deductive reasoning from basic axioms, particularly the principle of human action, known as praxeology. Austrian economists were skeptical of applying mathematical models and empirical methods to economics, as they believed that such methods could not fully capture the complexities of human behavior and market processes. Instead, they emphasized theoretical analysis based on logical deductions from fundamental principles of human action.
The differences between the two schools also extended to their views on science and knowledge.
The Vienna Circle sought to unify the sciences through a common logical framework. They believed that by applying the methods of logic and mathematics, it was possible to create a precise language for science, free from the ambiguities of everyday language. Their goal was to reduce all scientific knowledge to a set of logical propositions that could be verified through empirical observation.
The Austrian School, on the other hand, was more skeptical of the application of scientific methods to economics. While they valued knowledge and understanding of economic processes, they argued that economics was fundamentally different from the natural sciences because it dealt with human behavior, which could not be predicted or measured with the same precision as physical phenomena. Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek argued that economics required a different approach — one that recognized the limits of knowledge and the role of individual decision-making in shaping economic outcomes.
Despite these differences, there were also notable parallels between the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics, particularly in their skepticism of central planning and authority.
Both schools were critical of grand metaphysical systems and authoritarian approaches to knowledge or governance.
The Vienna Circle sought to dismantle traditional philosophical systems that relied on untestable assertions, advocating instead for a form of empiricism that demanded evidence and logical consistency.
Similarly, the Austrian School critiqued centralized economic planning and interventionism, arguing that such approaches were based on flawed assumptions about the ability to predict and control complex economic systems.
Friedrich Hayek’s work, in particular, echoed some of the Vienna Circle’s concerns about the dangers of overconfidence in human knowledge. His famous critique of socialism emphasized the impossibility of central planners having sufficient information to manage an economy effectively — a view that resonated with the Vienna Circle’s insistence on empirical verification and skepticism of grandiose claims.
Ultimately, while the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics both emerged from Vienna’s rich intellectual environment, their legacies diverged significantly.
The Vienna Circle’s influence was most strongly felt in the fields of philosophy, particularly in the development of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of science. Their ideas about logical analysis, the rejection of metaphysics, and the emphasis on empirical verification shaped much of 20th-century philosophical thought.
The Austrian School of Economics, meanwhile, became one of the leading schools of economic thought, particularly in its critiques of socialism and advocacy for free markets. Figures like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek continued to shape economic theory and policy debates, particularly in the context of discussions about the role of government in the economy.
While the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics operated in different intellectual spheres, they shared a common context in the rich intellectual environment of Vienna. Both schools were skeptical of grand systems and central planning, yet they diverged in their methodologies, objectives, and areas of focus.
The Vienna Circle sought to apply the methods of logic and science to philosophical problems, while the Austrian School emphasized the importance of individual human action and the limitations of scientific methods in understanding economics.
Together, they represent two distinct yet parallel threads in the intellectual history of Vienna, each leaving a lasting impact on their respective fields.

Vienna is a beautiful city, with significant uniqe baroque architectures. Vienna is one of my favorite cities. Additionally, Vienna is classified as the best living place for years.
As the name itself suggest that the castle has vivid and beautiful colors, that give a great idea of the life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This castle has a very green garden, with a huge plant labyrinth. There is a very famous story about this castle and especially about the plant labyrinth. The story is about a stunning empress Sissi, and her assassination.
On your way out of the castle, I would prefer you to visit the Tiergarten ( the zoo). The Zoo has many exotic and interesting animals. The workers in the zoo as well make extreamly interesting shows with the animals.

Vienna is the only city of my tour where I spent more time indoors than outdoors. So I didn’t take many pictures of the city and the buildings. The weather was über cold and my back was really aching from the weight of my coat and my camera, but the main reason was that it was Gustav Klimt’s city. And not only did he work on a lot of buildings in the city, but his paintings can be found in different museums as well. But before locking myself between closed doors, I took advantage of the first day’s beautiful sky to wander around the small paved streets of the city center. I felt many different things while discovering this new city. The buildings were tall and spotless, and the monuments were the biggest I’ve ever seen. Most of the city was painted in various shades of white: from pearl to ivory, pure white or cream. The contrast of white on the endless blue sky was incredible. In the very posh Main Street of the city center, I felt as if I were in a ski resort, without the snow. Vienna was an open-air museum, with a display of incredible works of art everywhere.
So my first day was focused on the city center, inside the tram lines that were drawing a circle around the center. I started to spot there and there some details of the Secession’s inspiration. The Engel Apotheke, the Ankeruhr Clock, the building on 16 Kärntner Strasse, the Cafe-Konditorei Aida… Of course I was not only looking at Art Nouveau details. The first day in a city was usually the time where I would be a proper tourist, viewing as much of the city as I could in one day, getting to know my surroundings better. Vienna was everything that I was told it was: majestic, monumental, very detailed and decorated buildings, quite easy to walk around on foot. There weren’t many narrow pre-renaissance streets like the Quartier Latin in Paris, for most of Vienna’s architecture is classicist, baroque or romanesque. However some remarkable exceptions can be found: the Hundertwasserhaus by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, an incredible expressionist appartement building, but also the Sezessionstil Palace, Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station, and the Kirche am Steinhof by Otto Wagner, three beautiful Art Nouveau buildings.
I use Art Nouveau and Sezessionstil to describe the architecture and art that can be found in Vienna. But to be completely accurate, I should even say Jugendstil. Art Nouveau is a global artistic movement that has spread through all of Europe, even as far as St Petersburg. However, it has a very specific name and style in every country.In France, and Belgium, it’s called Art Nouveau and, very much like the Liberty Style in Italy, it’s a very busy, detailed, asymmetric and decadent floral and organic design. In Spain, the catalan modernism movement is quite similar to Art Nouveau, but has more medieval, gothic and Arab influences. In the UK, it’s called Arts and Crafts and it’s already a little more stripped down, with more use of geometrical lines and symmetries. And to finish, there’s Germany’s Jugendstil, founded in Munich and that later influenced the Sezessionstil in Vienna. The Jugendstil movement is, like Arts and Crafts, quite close to the Art Deco movement in some ways, using geometric lines, which is something you couldn’t find in Art Nouveau. But there’s still a very strong presence of natural and organic inspirations. To me, the main characteristic that makes Jugendstil quite different from Art Nouveau is its Greek and Roman art and architecture style’s influences. Even a little bit of Japanese prints. Also, the recurrent use of mythological creatures, strong women and floral embellishments makes it a very one-of-a-kind artistic style. But I’ll write a longer and more detailed article on those artistic differences, that I got to learn and witness during my journey.
I was staying in a lovely hostel outside of the center, that took me some time on foot to get back to. There, I started to work on my daily pictures, when I met a guy from Alexandrie who was studying in Budapest and was staying in Vienna for the week-end. It was an amusing coincidence, and we began to talk about our common experience of Budapest and Vienna. He told me he intended to do a pub crawl the night after to meet people, but I didn’t feel like getting hammered with people I had just met in a city that I didn’t know much either. And knowing what happened to me on the next day, I guess I was right to be careful.
Traveling solo has up and downsides. And traveling alone as a woman has made me more concerned for my safety. But the only worrying moment during my tour was, surprisingly, in one of Vienna’s most central subway stations. Vienna was quite wide spread, so I had to take the subway/tram a few times during my stay if I were to be able to visit everything that I wanted. The second evening, as I was leaving the subway platform to get back to the surface, my peripheral vision caught the sight of a wary man locking his gaze on me, turning his heels and slowly walking towards me. My first reaction, as usual, was to pretend I hadn’t noticed him, as I tightened the grasp on my bag. My eyes scanned quickly my closest surroundings, as the man managed to slow his pace enough to find himself in my footsteps. It could have been a mere coincidence, was I thinking. I saw a few people on the escalator and rapidly climbed as close as I could behind them. The guy had suddenly caught up with me and hit his chest against my back, waving a drunken sorry, making the couple in front of me notice the situation. I decided to play it safe and gently poked the elbow of man before me. I silently pointed at the man behind, trying to make him understand I was not feeling secure. He nodded and spoke to his companion. I felt some reluctance on his part, but was quite decided to not find myself alone. When the escalator came to its end, I stayed close to them until I could see the other one hesitate for a few seconds before leaving the station in a different way. He might just have been a drunk like many people I had already stumbled upon in the metro, but this time my guts told me that I was a prey. And that is not something I ever want to feel again. At least those last seven years taking the metro alone in Paris had taught me some good instincts. But somehow I can’t help but wonder if it’s normal to be relieved to have developed such instincts. Why should anyone be scared to walk alone?
I decided not to let this unfortunate event put me to bed. I had lived an incredible experience a little bit earlier during the day, when I finally checked a box off my bucket-list: seeing my favorite painting, Judith und Holofernes.
My second day was destined to be spent going from museum to museum. I had done some researches on Klimt’s art, and had made a list of all the places to visit in order to see as many works of his art as possible (so yes, be prepared, the rest of this article is going to be very Klimt-centered). Most of his paintings could be found in the Belvedere Palace, an amazing baroque building complex a little bit outside of the center.The complex consists of two palaces, the Upper and Lower Belvedere. Unfortunately for me, the latter was closed for renovations (again). So I focused myself on the Upper Belvedere, where thankfully most of Klimt’s artworks were exhibited.
I arrived in front of the entrance and was welcomed by the beautiful sculpture of a Sphinx, in a very Jugendstil design. The main hall of the building was quite amazing as well, baroque carvings and sculptures all over the tall walls and large ceilings, all painted in the purest white. The whole place itself was a work of art. I began to travel through Austria’s history with paintings of the Habsburg Monarchy’s main leaders. I also admired beautiful landscapes of the countryside, and paintings of the country’s most famous artists through the centuries. I took my time, not wanting to rush the moment when I would finally set my eyes on the painting I came to see. And I finally set foot in the room where the first Secession paintings of Klimt were to be seen. I tried to stay focused on each and every one in front of me as I was slowly making my way through the room, not wanting to spoil myself by taking a full view of the room. First, the « Lady at the Fireplace », a Symbolism piece, where the main color palette Klimt used was black and dark grey, outlined by a simple golden frame. Then, « Josef Lewinsky als Carlos in Clavigo ». This one had already the influence of what would become later Klimt’s trademark: a geometric design, golden and greek-like details framing the main character in the center of the painting, and Klimt’s distinctive handwriting giving a name to the painting. After a disturbing but fascinating piece called « Die bösen Mütter » from Giovanni Segantini, where bad mothers were trapped on a tree with the child they wanted to abandon until they took their responsibility for it, I slowly turned to face the incredible Judith.
To be perfectly honest, the first thing that came to my mind was « Oh, she’s smaller than I had imagined » (people who saw the Joconde for the first time would understand the feeling). And yet, the size did not tarnish the beautiful arrogance of Judith’s expression. The end of the 19th century was a new page for women in Europe. They strongly believed in their rights and were ready to fight for them. They began to take a more important place in the world and in the society. They were no longer the pure, sweet and innocent mother figure like Marie-Madeleine that they were forced into for centuries. No, they had become Eve, capable of choosing for themselves what was right, to take the path to knowledge and therefore, power. And Klimt was quite aware of these changes. He used to say « There is no self-portrait of me. I am not interested in my own person as “object of representation”, but in other beings, especially female, and even more in apparitions. » Most of his female figures were strong, independent women. In the artistic movement he founded, the Vienna Secession, many female artists were included. Judith is the archetype of the femme fatale, described by Franz A. J. Szabo as a « [symbol of] triumph of the erotic feminine principle over the aggressive masculine one ». Male critics would depict her as a cruel woman, taking pleasure in the murder of her opponent. But that’s not what I feel from the painting. She’s arrogant, sensual and beautiful. But moreover, she’s powerful. She wasn’t afraid to use her feminity and erotism to trick Holofernes. But she did not do it to please herself. She did what she had to do to protect her people, and with the weapons that she could use. Women don’t have brute force, so they rely on other skills. Her facial expression does not say « I enjoyed killing Holofernes ». It says « See what happens when you underestimate women’s abilities ». Klimt’s Judith is a fierce strategist, who prides herself with the result of her plotting. Why should she be called cruel for that?
I could have stayed in front of the paintings for hours, taking in closely every details as possible. The metallic, golden and geometrical frame was designed by Gustav and created by his brother, Georg, the least famous of the Klimt Brothers and yet a brilliant craftsman. The jewels of Judith, especially her fascinating necklace, are an intricate mix of gold and precious stones. Her translucent cape is opened on her chest, showing her breast. And she holds Holofernes’ head against her hip, almost out of the picture, to illustrate that he’s not the main interest of the painting, merely a means to an end.
Next to Judith was Vivien, a sculpture by the master of Symbolism and member of the Vienna Secession, Fernand Khnopff. Although this sculpture and the global work of the artist are aesthetically breathtaking, he was not known to be very kind towards women, rather the opposite. I was quite surprised to see this association, for I believe Klimt and Khnopff did not share the same opinion on women. But females in Khnopff paintings are, very much like Klimt’s, ethereal figures of seduction and erotism, inspired by the Preraphaelist muses, and he was a true inspiration to a younger Klimt.
Exhibitions and museums tend to teach you a lot more than common knowledge on the artists behind the paintings that you can easily admire. I learned about Khnopff’s disdain towards women during the Petit Palais exhibition in Paris last year. And later in Vienna, I discovered that another painter that I admired, Egon Schiele, has served time in jail for abusing one of his models, an underaged young girl. Getting to know more about the men behind the art, learning about their retrograde values or hideous crimes led me to a point where I was wondering whether I should still admire their work. It was easy to do so when their paintings were just paintings. But knowing more about the artists however, brought up some conflicting emotions. The never-ending question of separating the man and the artist. To be honest, I still haven’t found the right answer to that question. So for now, I continue to admire Schiele and Khnopff’s paintings for the work of art they are, and since they’re long gone, they can’t benefit from that.
In the following room after Judith, were exhibited some of Klimt’s masterpieces: The Kiss, was in the center of it all ; some portraits: Sonja Knips, Fritza Riedler, Amalie Zuckerkandl, and Johanna Staude ; the unfinished Die Braut, and finally Adam und Eva. From Schiele could be found the marvelous pieces Tod und Mädchen, Die Familie and Die Umarmung. I spent many hours in contemplation of these paintings before leaving the museum, light headed and with a feeling of accomplishment.
I went back to the city center and grabbed lunch at the Palmenhaus, a beautiful greenhouse that was mostly turned into a restaurant, but still with beautiful trees inside. The left side of the Palmhaus was used as a butterflies greenhouse, so I took the chance to enter this eerie and enchanting universe. Then, I went to the Leopold Museum. I wanted to visit the Museum of Art History beforehand, where I could find Klimt’s Athena and Cleopatra’s paintings on the great hall’s walls, but the entrance’s fees of all the museums I wanted to visit began to pile up considerably. Culture in Vienna came with a price, and not a cheap one. The Leopold Museum was cheaper and different, more modern, so I was curious to visit it. And I was right to follow my instincts because the museum had a whole room dedicated to the Vienna Secession and some famous artists, including women like Alma Mahler, Emilie Flöge, Berta Zuckerkandl, Dora Kallmus… I also found more of Schiele’s paintings, Klimt’s Death and Life and more importantly, the amazing triptych Medicine, Philosophy and Jurisprudence. The latter is a reproduction of his original artwork, a controversial piece painted for the University of Vienna, that was unfortunately burnt by the Nazis in 1945.
But Klimt’s triptych was not the only inheritance of the Secession that fell in the hands of the Nazis. The Secession Palace was destroyed for they viewed it as a symbol of decadent art. However, it was faithfully reconstructed after the War. I visited the Palace on my last day in Vienna. I also came across a couple of Jugendstil buildings close to the Palace, like the Majolikahaus built by Otto Wagner. To be fair, there are two things that are really interesting about the Secession Palace nowadays: the building itself, and Klimt’s masterpiece of the Beethoven Frieze.
The Palace was designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a manifesto for Vienna’s Secession, an artistic movement created by artists such as Klimt, Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner, who resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists to rebel against their traditional (if not retrograde) artistic point of view. The Palace itself is a white, geometrical building with touches of gold and green. It’s the essence of the Jugendstil style: the roof is a giant globe of golden olive tree leaves, three owls are perched on the sides of the monument and the entrance is garded by three Gorgons’ heads, representing painting, sculpture, and architecture, and two geckos. The famous « Ver Sacrum » (sacred spring, inspired by antic italien rites), the Secession’s motto, words are pinned on the wall near the entrance, and you can read « Der Zeit ihre Kunst, Der Kunst hire Freiheit » (to every age its art, to every art its freedom) above the Gorgons.
Inside the Palace, in the basement, can be admired the Beethoven Frieze. It represents mankind’s search for happiness through the journey of a Golden Knight, followed by the figures of compassion and ambition. The Knight has to face dark forces such as the titan Typhoeus, his daughters the Gorgons of lust, intemperance and indecency, the three Fates, and allegories of pain, disease and death. But, thanks to the figure of Poetry in the last panel, the Knight reaches the « Ode to Joy », where five women representing the Arts are painted. The painting represents how mankind can appease its suffering through the arts. Klimt created here a total work of art, combining painting with music and architecture (through the use of space, the three walls, the high frieze, and the Secession building).
And that, was the most beautiful lesson to be learned while my artistic journey in Vienna was coming to an end. I ended up the day with a guided visit of the Burgtheater, where Ernst and Gustav Klimt had painted the ceilings with another friend, Franz Matsch. It was before they decided to resign from the traditional ways of the Association of Austrian Artists. And it’s the only place where you can find a little cameo of the three artists, and it might be the only self-portrait of Gustav Klimt that could ever be found.

“My dream writing room would be the Imperial Library in Vienna.” Fran Lebowitz
The word “cosy” means different things to different people. For some, it’s sipping a cup of chai in the comfort of home. For others, it’s watching your favorite series without interruptions. It might be talking to friends or family about something meaningful, or spending quality time with loved ones. In other words, it’s that moment when you’re truly yourself — when you’re not bound by any obligation, when you’re quietly loving yourself, and when you’re living, not just existing.
I try to find these cosy moments in my home, and today that moment came while painting a memory from Vienna. The art is far from perfect and still incomplete. The art is inspired from a church which was across our apartment in Vienna. I snapped a photo, thinking that one day I might paint it. Today, I finally did. When you visit a city, you carry it with you forever and Vienna is that city for me. Isn’t is beautiful you need not pay money to be an artist or a writer. Your own memories are enough. All you need is a pen and a paper and you keep doing it again and again as if that’s how you will attain salvation.
I’ll take my time with this. Watercolor isn’t my favorite medium, but I will try to do my best to paint the memory.
February Weeds & Wildflowers Writing Prompt is Cosy. Sharing today’s memory for the same. Thanks to the editors of Weeds and Wildflowers publication for the space for my rambling.

Vienna is a thriving cultural hub with beautiful architecture and fascinating history. It was also named the “World’s Most Livable City” by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
That’s why I recently packed my bags and moved to Vienna. I wanted to see if the city lived up to the hype. And sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.
Here are my first impressions of Vienna:
While wandering the streets of Vienna, a street food stall caught my eye. I decided I would try some traditional Austrian food. Not knowing a lot of German or Austrian cuisine, I pointed to what I thought looked tasty.
“Käsekrainer” the man said.
“Danke schön (Thank you),” I replied.
He handed me a plate with the largest sausage I had ever seen in my life, cut up into small pieces. Then, he gave me a slice of bread and some ketchup on the side.

Are there still fireworks in a famously quiet, central residential area in Austria’s capital?
New Year’s Eve in Vienna used to sound like being thrown into a war zone — a staccato of explosions with sound volume close to or above the pain threshold for hours and hours and hours … But those days are gone. Over the last few years, the change of years became relatively silent in Austria’s capital. Officially, the main reason is that Vienna has forbidden all pyrotechnics above class F1 (anything children are legally allowed to use) within city borders. Further, supermarkets no longer sell fireworks, citizens are more concerned about the environmental and climate impact, and dog owners (Austrians cherish their furry family members) have become more vocal.
This is especially true for my residential area — the Nordbahnhofviertel. This rather new part of the city, although very central, is quiet as can be. It is traffic-calmed, has many driving bans, and sometimes you get the impression that there are more cargo bikes than cars. And, predominantly inhabited by young families, it is not a party hotspot by far.
Anyway, even there, fireworks and firecrackers still exist, and people either love or hate them. Depending on the side, the reported noise quantification fluctuates between Animal Crossing and Call of Duty scenarios. Unsatisfying as this is, I have decided to put a little more data into this discussion.
I have used the mobile app Night Hark to measure the sound volume during the night and to detect the sound of fireworks/firecrackers. Therefore, I have placed an iPhone 8 next to the closed window in my apartment on the third floor and let it record the night. I put it into my home office room with closed doors, so there might be some noise contamination from my family and me, but it shouldn’t be too bad. After all, I can code there without being disturbed by my kids playing Ninja in the living room shouting the name of Jutsus.
I will report the sound volume in decibels full scale. Since mobile phones use digital microphones, one only gets the sound pressure level relative to the maximum signal capacity of the microphone (= 0 dbfs). I don’t know how much that is for an iPhone, but my best guess would be to put it somewhere close to 100 dB. The app would also return an A-filtered measure, which is tuned to the hearing spectrum of humans, but since this is at least partly about animals and I have no clue if A-filtered would be appropriate, I stick with dbfs (if you know more about this, please let me know in the comments).
Before we get to the results, a last help for interpreting them: Loudness is not linear. An increase of 10 dB corresponds to a perceived doubling of loudness. So 60 dB is double as loud as 50 dB.
We can see in Fig. 1, which displays the max sound pressure level per minute, that there is a build-up till midnight when loudness jumps to its max value and stays there for around half an hour before ebbing down. During the build-up there seem to be two local maxima at around 19:00 and 21:00 — maybe those were fireworks for very small and small children who cannot stay awake till midnight. After 2 o’clock, it is practically quiet.
Further, the scale was never maxed out with 0 dbfs, so the phone could have been able to quantify even louder sounds. The loudest minute was 0:32 with -17.8 dbfs. If my guess of a max value of 100 dB is correct, this would correspond to 82.3 dB, or for reference, a motorcycle or a crying baby. Not quiet, but only an eighth of the loudness of a disco at 110 dB or a 32nd of the pain threshold at 130 dB.
Honing in on fireworks and firecrackers, I looked at the count of either fireworks or explosion classifications with a score greater or equal to .05. (Night Hark uses YAMNet, a neural network, that can classify sound snippets of 0.975 seconds into 500+ categories. Each sound category gets a score between 0 and 1, with greater values indicating a higher likelihood that the snippet belongs to the specific category). Since the sound behind the window is somewhat muffled and the time resolution is limited, this is no 1:1 representation of the actual number of bangs, but the proportions between time-frames should be valid.
In Fig. 2, we can again see a clear peak at midnight, a local maximum at 20:30, and a hard stop at 02:00.
Whether this is a lot or quasi-nothing lies in the ear of the listener, but I am sure this is comparatively silent for New Year’s Eve in a metropolis. I am interested in your experiences and thoughts on that, so please let me know in the comments.
If you want to look at the data, you can find it here.
Night Hark, the app I have used for the sound measurements, is available on iOS and Android.

It is the curse of my life that I can move faster than the seasons, hop between continents overnight and change countries like fashion but I can never escape seasonal allergies. I thought coming to Vienna from Croatia would be a good change of climate and that change of seasons would get rid of my allergies. Alas, the springtime pains continue.
I spent two nights in Vienna with enough time on the first day to walk around the city and take pictures of all the baroque and neoclassical architecture. I started off at the Wein Rathaus (city hall) and then wandered through a rose garden to the Ephesos Museum and later arrived at St. Stephen’s Cathedral. What I noticed the most along the streets were the decorations at the top and corners of the buildings.
Many of the older buildings have statues sculpted and moulded to tell a story that I do not know. I wondered if these semiotics remained relevant today and if knowing them would make the buildings any more significant or if they’re just meaningless decoration. Somehow I doubt it.
In Invisible Cities by Itali Calvino Marco Polo says, “You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.” To which Khan replies, “or the questions it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.”
Stephen’s Cathedral is the jewel of the city and it was kinda cool but also less impressive than I expected. Mass was in session so I couldn’t walk the nave but it wasn’t as tall nor as ground as other cathedrals I’ve visited.
On the south side is a tower 343 steps up to the bell tower. The entrance is sort of hidden in the corner. I thought there’d be more to it but it was literally a single spiral staircase going up and up and up. The only break was for the bell room, sans bell, and at the top it was a chamber to buy souvenirs with small windows on the four sides. I thought the cityscape would be more interesting but there wasn’t much to see. The roof had an interesting tiled pattern on it but even that was difficult to see from this vantage.
Since it was going to rain the next day I decided to check out some nearby parks to see if they were interesting. I walked along the canals and came to Augarten park which had a distinctly familiar tower. It was only after reading the plaque that I remembered seeing it in a YouTube video. These are two of six World War 2 anti-aircraft towers built to protect the city. One is a command/communication tower and the other is for the guns.
After my thesis I’ve taken an interest in the architecture of memorials and dilapidated structures. The architecture of this war has been preserved as a reminder to the horrors of forced labour under the social nationalist regime — but it got me thinking about how we preserve old and culturally important of structures. The towers are clearly decaying and concrete is spalling off. Around the base is a fence. They no longer guard the city but being surrounded by parkland are evident along the city skyline.
At first I wondered why the structure isn’t open to the public to climb and explore. Since it’s from a recent war and not a long ago castle or fortress this probably isn’t appropriate. It’s also apparently dangerous according to the youtube video because of a failed attempt to destroy it.
But to leave it to decay seems like a lost opportunity. Why isn’t there art? Murals or ribbons or lights that in the immediate term express peace juxtaposed to war. I’d first seen the towers from the top of St. Stephen’s cathedral. I’d thought them a fortress worth checking out. I suppose I was partly correct, but if they had been colourful and less stoic, maybe there would be a better relationship to the city. In the long term, seeing vegetation slowly consume the structure might be a suitable future. This would be better then the current state of decay as pigeon on roosts but I suspect realistically they will fall into disrepair to a state where the government has to demolish them.
I found this online, https://www.worldbook.com/behind-the-headlines/Mythic-Monday-The-Riddle-of-the-Sphinx:
The Sphinx is found in both ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology. In the story of Oedipus, the goddess Hera sent the Sphinx to plague the people of the ancient city of Thebes. This was punishment for an ancient crime, possibly the failure to atone for the crimes of a former king of Thebes. The Sphinx sat perched on a mountain cliff nearby the ancient city. The creature guarded Thebes with a riddle that she had learned from the Muses. Each time a traveler failed to solve her riddle, she devoured them, effectively preventing anyone from leaving or entering the city.
The riddle? “What being has four legs, then two, and then three?” Some accounts write it, “What has four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?”
After many people guessed incorrectly and were killed, the king of Thebes announced that he would give the kingdom to anyone who could solve the riddle. The road past Mount Phicion, where the Sphinx awaited her victims, was strewn with the bones of people who had failed to find the right answer. Eventually, Oedipus, fleeing Corinth, solved the riddle. He answered, “Man, who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two legs, and finally needs a cane in old age.” Upon hearing the correct answer, the Sphinx jumped from the cliff to her death. The plague of Thebes was lifted.
It would seem that Vienna is asking me what wonders I like while simultaneously holding me captive. But where the riddle has a simple answer, the question might be rhetoric. I’m not convinced that the answer is a wonder at all…
The wonders of Vienna seem to palaces and the most prominent is the Schönbrunn Palace. It was an 18th century summer home for the emperor and there are two tours of the inside. These tours have been scripted to move the highest volume of tourists through in the least time. Measured by the number of rooms (22 or 40) the latter takes just 50 minutes. Both are accompanied by audio guides to shuffle along the cattle and since photography isn’t allowed, there’s little reason to linger.
I was once again sniffled by being too old to get the student discount and ended up paying more because I visited the Sisi museum but didn’t get a combined ticket (the student rates would have been cheaper). The Sisi museum was more interesting because the second half was a story about the empress and had a narrative to follow. In both places I was surprised by the lack of luxury on the interior since there are so many other decorated buildings with statues and faces on the facades in the city. This might be because the emperor Franz Joseph was known for leading a simple life devoted to running the country. Another strange aspect of the two residence I saw, at the summer palace and in the city, were that the main rooms didn’t seem to be located central to the buildings. It was as if the emperor and empress lived to the side. There was a model of the palace and where the royal residence were was far removed from the centre.
While the buildings were somewhat of a disappointment, the Schonburnn gardens behind the summer palace was nice and free. I particularly enjoyed the Roman Ruins which were an artificial construct fashionable during the 18th century with the rise of Romanticism that symbolizes the decline of revered civilizations and the desire to preserve relics. Interestingly, romanticism intentionally creates ruins from scratch as a point of interest in the garden but does not actually preserve anything.
At the top of the hill the Gloriette Schloss Schönbrunn is an observation pavilion that looked cool but I didn’t purchase a ticket to go to the rooftop. Instead I walked around the base and then made my way back down the hill. Though it is a symmetrical garden, I was kind of surprised that the most colour was on the wings in the rose gardens. Between the palace and the hilltop was a fountain and just grass fields.
The architecture in Vienna was interesting but I found myself more interested in the typical 5 storey housing typology than the palaces or monuments. Many of these housing buildings were distinctly recognizable as Germanic and I would have liked to study the buildings and statues decorating the top more closely. Unfortunately the Airbnb I stayed was the ground floor of a grimy building of little historical significance. Other than a water fountain in the hallway, now brackish, there was little evidence of how people might have lived before a mid-century renovation. I made a poor selection in this AirBnB to save a few bucks. Neither did it help the war on allergies that the place had grimy floors or that the room smelled musty. After two nights I was very happy to leave.
I realized in my next destination that what draws me the most isn’t the seven or seventy wonders of the city but what might have been there before.

Vienna has a register for its trees. I learned this through my favourite crowd-sourcing app, iNaturalist. It allows identifying surrounding plants and animals by simply making a picture and uploading it through the app. A community of fellow users and iNaturalist algorithms suggest possible identifications.
I was scrolling on my way to give a talk but I still had some time, so I went into a park to observe some Viennese urban wildlife. One of my observations was a tree (probably poplar).
The observation is registered in iNaturalist as observation #22987310. Not long after uploading the images to iNaturalist I got the feedback that I should have listed the observation as a cultivated tree. “My” tree was apparently planted and it is 45 years old and has the tree registry number 30.
It is these kinds of interactions and data linkages, that makes me love iNaturalist and its community.

A week ago I was in Vienna, Austria for 48 hours. It was a short but meaningful trip.
The city is renowned for its “café culture.” A very particular collection of biases and instincts that shape the behaviors one can see.
The most iconic example of this particular collection is Café Central, a classical, old world café. Here’s an area near the front windows.
The café is famous, in part, because it was Adolf Hitler’s favorite when he lived in Vienna. Joseph Stalin’s too. In fact, for a time in 1913, Stalin, Hitler, Trotsky and Freud all lived within a kilometer of this meeting place.
Needless to say, the café is not a beacon of modernity.
The coffee was bitter and bland.
The service was (intentionally) bad. Half an hour before black coffee arrived.
The people were uniformly white and mostly old.
They were gossiping and gawking. Looking for and at those that didn’t fit the narrative of early 20th century Vienna.
On Monday, my 3pm flight allowed just enough time for one more Viennese café.
We went in a different direction this time. To a “third wave” coffee shop located near the University of Vienna called Coffee Pirates.
It couldn’t have been further from what we’d seen at Café Central.
The service was brisk and friendly.
The coffee was made slowly, to order, and with care.
The patrons were working, learning, building.
The presentation was thoughtful and generous.
From the moment we opened the door to the moment it closed behind us, were constantly invited to participate in the story that Coffee Pirates was telling about coffee. A story about community, about the way we connect.
Café Central was telling a very different story about coffee. One much more steeped in tradition for tradition’s sake. One about the premium of exclusion and the value of difference.
Café Central was a story about the ways things were.
Coffee Pirates is a story about the ways things will be.
I know where I want to spend my time.

Throwback To 2020: Life In Vienna During The Initial Days Of The COVID-19 Pandemic,https://palarkaprabha.medium.com/throwback-to-2020-life-in-vienna-during-the-initial-days-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-a2dfe7fdd017,"Sign up

Read the Bangla version of this article that was published on Unish Kuri.
It was a reasonably chilly February afternoon when I first caught the attention of the sudden rise of COVID 19 cases in Europe as I made my way back home from a fine art event in one of the quintessential Viennese red and white trams. Most of these cases were overwhelmingly being reported from Italy and Spain. Like any other layperson, my initial reactions were a concoction of wishful reasoning, indifference, slight concern, and ignorance. I continued to plan and work on all the assignments and deadlines I had for the upcoming spring and summer months. My attitude was hinging towards being carefree and believing that the virus was “just another flu” with probably slightly more severe symptoms.
However, within a matter of one week, as the number of infected people and the death toll began to rise just across the border in Italy, I finally grasped the reality of the situation and realized that it was just a matter of days before Vienna and other neighboring cities in Central Europe faced the same crisis. By the beginning of the second week of March, Austria started recording many new cases of infection daily, and I had to cancel all my plans for the upcoming months immediately without second thoughts. I started educating myself rigorously on this coronavirus to avoid unwanted panic through misinformation and fake news and arm myself to the teeth in case of the worst. Living halfway across the globe from my family in Kharagpur, it was pretty challenging to fathom and accept this unprecedented crisis and the sweeping changes it would bring in the future, both at a personal and community level.
Austria decided to go into a complete lockdown on 16th March, as the healthcare systems in Italy and Spain were put to the test for the first time since the Second World War. The number of infections rapidly rose across the European Union, prompting the WHO to declare Europe the pandemic’s epicenter. For the first time in my life, I felt completely exposed to a severe crisis, a feeling which I had only imagined partially or grasped by reading newspaper articles on wars and calamities. There was a great hustle on the days leading up to the lockdown in Vienna, with people hoarding food, medical, and other essential supplies like toilet paper and sanitizers. I, too, had to rush to multiple stores and secure basic supplies as not enough guidelines were available in English in the initial days. There was an eerie feeling that it was the silence before the storm- an impending natural disaster or war-like aggression. The government was swift to tackle this problem within a matter of days by ensuring smooth and unhindered supplies and providing detailed information in English to the expatriate community on their official website.
The quarantine days have been very stressful for me like billions of others around the globe, worrying about the human cost of this pandemic, possible shapes and forms of the job market for young graduates like myself, and their long-term psychological impact. Amidst all this negativity, the only silver lining from my quarantine has been the rediscovery of latent interests I have had, ranging from cooking various meals to experimenting with various forms of sketching. I humbly acknowledge my privilege to be able to indulge in these activities. An interesting observation arising out of being locked in the same apartment building for weeks together in this period has been the growing sense of belonging to this city and my neighborhood, which I never felt before as a foreign student. It is a life-long bond that I will carry into my old age.
The strict lockdown measures were relaxed earlier this week, and further restrictions would be lifted by the end of April. Being the first country in Europe to flatten the curve, the authorities in Austria aim to put the country back into much-needed economic normalcy by the middle of May. It seems for the moment that the initial cannonball has been dodged as deafening silence and apocalyptic scenes of deserted streets continue to loom large over the breakfast servings of apple tarts and melange coffee in Vienna. If the current levels of precautions and alertness are not maintained, the virus might regain strength again and cause another wave of casualties. The historian in me hopes that the city will overcome this dark chapter like it repeatedly did in the past in the events of the Mongol threats, the Ottoman sieges, the Spanish Flu pandemic, and the horrors leading up to and during the Second World War. And I cannot help but wonder how in these days of fighting the coronavirus, Mozart would have composed a string quartet, Klimt would have painted, and Freud would have psychoanalyzed his patients

It’s been a while since my last blog! I’ve been taking some time to reflect on my summer, spend time with family and friends and have been swamped with Givesie and participating as a vendor at many local Portland events during the last few months.
But I am back this week and wanted to share with you my amazing trip to Europe this summer! I got the chance to visit Vienna, Austria and Zurich and Lucerne, Switzerland with my parents. It was by far one of the best experiences of my life! And to be able to share those memories with my mom and dad is priceless.
Vienna has this richness in history and architecture; the museums, the palaces, the statues, the cathedrals and gardens are breathtakingly beautiful and so intricate in detail! One of my favorite sights to see was the St. Stephan’s Cathedral, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna and the current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, which was completed in the year 1160. It is the most important religious building in Vienna, “has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city’s most recognizable symbols.” Walking inside I was immediately in awe of the stunning, yet dark and dramatic beauty of the interior. Words could not describe the sense of peace, calm and excitement I felt all at once walking through.
The Schonbrunn Palace is one of the busiest tourist sites to see in Vienna. It is a neoclassical style palace and was built during the reign of empress Maria Theresa and was also the home of Franz Joseph, the longest-reigning emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, along with his wife Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria. I loved touring through this palace, it was decorated exactly how it would have looked when it was first built. I felt like I had gone back in time, envisioning what it would have been like to be alive and living during the 18th/19th centuries.
Another one of my favorite places to visit was the Belvedere Palace. Consisting of two Baroque palaces, the Upper and Lower and set in the Baroque park landscape and the Belvedere garden, it houses the Belvedere museum. Walking through the museum I was surrounded by the most stunning pieces of historical art done by some of the most famous artists from around the world and from centuries ago! Definitely a sight to see!
As we wrapped up our tour of the museum we worked up an appetite — so, mom, dad and I had to stop at the cutest little café on the palace grounds for a late afternoon latte and pastry! So. Good.
After our amazing time in Vienna, we were off to Zurich and Lucerne, both are beautiful cities surrounded by stunning mountain ranges, lakes and charming medieval towns.
The train ride my parents and I took from Vienna to Zurich was probably one of my most favorite parts of the trip! It was an eight hour ride, but felt so much shorter! We had such a great time chatting, taking pictures, eating delicious meals, passing by and stopping through small towns, seeing the gorgeous mountainous scenery and huge lakes and rivers. We spent just a few days in Zurich, seeing Old Town, browsing through local boutique shops, shopping for souvenirs, as well as taking a day trip to Lucerne along with a boat ride on the lake. Even though it was a short time — it was absolutely perfect! I remember sitting outside this adorable French outdoor cafe by the lake and enjoying an afternoon espresso with my parents, while people watching — and thinking to myself — I can’t believe I am actually here and enjoying this beautiful moment with my mom and dad that I will cherish forever.
This trip gave me such perspective and such an appreciation for travel and exploration! Being in a new environment, new people, new culture. There is such a big world out there to see and experience. We tend to get caught up in our normal routines, the everyday tasks, work, etc…and tend to forget that there is so much to appreciate in life! Sometimes you just have to get out of your comfort zone and your norm to be able to see things in a new light. xx

A city that reminds me
Of a town,
Vienna,
The one with cool winds
And cooler heads.
On a Sunday,
Everyone gets a break,
The city shuts down,
As if on a curfew.
No shoppers or eaters
Roaming on the streets,
All establishments shut
And everyone stays home.
For an outsider
Vienna seems forlorn,
Like their city did during the lockdown.
But for insiders,
It is a paradise
As they enjoy time with family
At home.
Even on a Monday,
There is no hurry,
No running behind a bus or a train
No speed walking down the pathways.
Those going to the office or school,
Stroll at their pace,
Enjoying the winds
And the sun,
And their coffee in breaks.
They work at their pace
Enjoying the task at hand,
Undisturbed by the distractions,
As if in a mystic flow.
They cycle, calm and slow,
Not in a hurry to reach their destination
For them, the journey
Seems to be their destination.
Not formal wear,
No big cars or big frills
Just them in their shorts and ts
Going about their day
Like it’s a treat.
Living their lives
In a pause,
They teach me
How to take a break,
And learn how to walk slow,
To enjoy every moment,
Whether on vacation,
Or at work.
They teach me
To lessen my agendas
To leave behind the past
And let the future rest
To be in the present,
In this here and now.
I learn to sit still,
Immerse myself in the now,
Enjoy my surroundings,
And the words I read;
Stopping for a coffee
Every now and then.

Like Atlas, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, wait staff in Vienna take their job very, very seriously.
Vienna: the capital of Austria, home of the Hasburg dynasty, old architecture and tardy, poker faced, sarcastic wait staff.
In one of Europe’s oldest cities, with a long and rich cultural history, and a reputation as one of the world’s centres of art and learning, the wait staff rule supreme. Long waits for service, being ignored and a general attitude of low level irritation that you want to be a customer seems to be the norm.
Ancient architecture = posh attitude
One travel brochure (The Free Map For Young and Clever People) proclaims that in Vienna, “The waiter is king. Don’t be surprised if the waiters are unfriendly - not the guest is king, he is. Treat him as your superior and he will reward you.” The brochure also claims that “waiters NEVER smile” and that for tipping “5-10% of the bill is the amount the king expects from his subjects.”
The advice in The Free Map for Young And Clever People is ridiculously honest and self-deprecating.
To begin with you are annoyed and maybe offended by this behaviour. But, after a few experiences you realise that it’s not actually you personally the waiter hates, it’s everybody – perhaps it’s a persona they all adopt as part of their profession or as a survival tactic against drunk and obnoxious tourists who don’t speak German.
My personal experiences of this phenomenon were being told I had ordered children’s beer when choosing a 330ml sized glass (normal serving size in my country) instead of a ½ litre. My bad. Another was overhearing the same waiter yell at a patron asking them if they wanted to see a menu. Theoretically, this sounds like he was being helpful and doing his job. However, in person, his tone, body language and glare revealed the true nature of his passive aggressive overture. What he actually said nonverbally was “buy something to eat or f**K off”.
When your office is this plush you might be forgiven for developing an arrogant attitude.
A further experience was when buying a Kaserkrainer (vienesse hotdog) from a street vendor in the early hours of the morning. The vendor must have been earning significantly less than the barman and really needed the customers, but felt the need to finish his entire cigarette before deining to serve us. He then spent less time than it took to smoke it heating a sausage on the grill, before wrapping it and throwing it on the counter for me to collect. The patience we were expected to show while waiting was not reciprocal. While we fumbled uncoordinated and inebriated for the correct change, his bloodshot eyes glared with annoyance. How dare we bother him to prepare his advertised victuals and deign to give him a few euros for his disgruntled efforts.
This attitude is strange considering that you want to spend your money at the establishment where said wait staff are employed. You might think they would be welcoming of a tourist who wants to donate them money. You may highlight the link between your custom and their wages – but you would be wrong. The waiter just has no f**ks to give about you and your desires to eat or drink or be treated like a human being.
“Let them eat cake” - Marie Antionette was a Hasburg and probably developed the attitude that cost her life while growing up in Vienna.
Sometimes this apathy worked in our favour. For example, when the bus driver was in danger of having to do something untoward, such as turn in his seat, converse with you and maybe issue you a ticket. Instead, it was easier for him to just lift his eyes, wave his hand dismissively towards the general direction of the back of the bus and grunt something. We interpreted this as there would be no charge, but it may have meant - “I just don’t give a s**t.” I doubt he would have come to our defence if an undercover ticket check had taken place.
Advice for ‘Acting like a local' — “Be Grumpy”
The Free Map for Young and Clever People makes an effort to explain why the Viennesse hate on life. Under the heading ‘Act like a Local’ it was suggested that you “be grumpy”. Supposedly, it is “mandatory” for “original Vienesse to complain if the bus is one minute late or the weather is too hot/cold/wet/sunny. This “mentality” (general bad attitude) was justified as being part of the rich Vienesse culture and is based on hundreds of years of historical precedent and practice.
Back in the day (16-18th Centuries), Vienna was the home of the Hasburg Dynasty and the centre of several empires. As such it was a center of commerce, education, construction etc, and developed a large bureaucracy which served the monarchy and employed half the population of the city. Everybody knows that a high standard of living, steady employment and job security suck, so it is understandable that these unlucky civil servants developed a negative attitude.
Members of the Hasburg dynasty pretty much ruled most of Europe in the 16th - 18th centuries
According to the Free Map for Young and Clever People this explains why wait staff, and more generally everyone (especially if they had an ancestor who worked for the government) has the historical right to be grumpy, rude or generally a dick.
Other historical facts from the Free Map include how after WWII “all the Nazis miraculously disappear and the population suffers a collective loss of memory as far as the last 7 years are concerned.”
This appeal to history is obviously a bullsh**t excuse to act like a jerk. More likely, people being people, they could not leave their work at work and the hierarchal structure of a feudal bureaucracy permeated into their attitudes and behaviour outside of their jobs. Add a mix of simian tribalism or pack behaviour and next thing everyone is looking down their noses at anyone else their social standing allows them to – and treating them accordingly.
What is mystifying is that in contemporary Vienna, a city where the Arts and Humanities are cultivated, this is a standard of behaviour that some aspire to. Or perhaps it’s as simple as:
“If you don’t like a person, it’s because they remind you of something you don’t like about yourself.” — Sigmund Freud, father of modern psychology and resident of Vienna, before being forced to fleeing prior to WWII.

A Captivating Train Journey Through Stunning Landscapes From Vienna to Munich,https://travelsimplygo.medium.com/a-captivating-train-journey-through-stunning-landscapes-from-vienna-to-munich-a50e60777015,"Sign up

I decided to ditch the flight mode this time and chose to travel by train for the remainder of my Europe tour. This was the last leg of my 20-day Europe trip, and I had booked train tickets from Vienna to Munich in advance. Yes, it was a great decision.
I had traveled by train in Europe before on several other trips and the experience was stupendous. Notable among them -
Paris to Interlaken in Switzerland
Within Switzerland most of the travel I undertook by train
London to Edinburgh
Rome to Venice
Each form of transport has its advantages and disadvantages. Having different types of travel experiences is worthwhile and we must try them all. It is Fun !!
While trains have a charm of their own, one of the drawbacks is that you have to take care of your luggage and stack them in their proper place. Unlike a flight where your luggage is checked in and taken care of soon after you arrive, making you feel relaxed and free.
On the other hand, to catch a flight, you have to reach the airport at least two hours in advance and go through security, etc, while traveling by train does not involve any of these processes. Hence it is hassle-free and time-saving.
An additional reward of train travel is that you get to enjoy the bewitching countryside views.
Another benefit of train travel is that it is cheaper compared to flights.
Staying in the Ibis hotel directly opposite the railway station in Vienna was so convenient. Firstly, it was a great place to have your meals at the elaborate food court inside the station building. Similar to what we have at malls or airports, you could choose from a wide variety of cuisines.
Secondly, boarding my train to Munich was a breeze. All I had to do was cross the street and within minutes I was at the train station. Though I had the tickets downloaded on my phone, due to unfamiliar language, the platform and the seat numbers were not clear. As such a day prior to my departure, I went and clarified at the information kiosk. The result was that on the travel day everything was smooth sailing.
The railways have done a fantastic job of making train travel incredibly easy and comfortable. I really appreciate the presence of glass waiting lounges (similar to the one at Vienna) at railway stations — a protection for passengers against harsh weather conditions.
Absorbing the last glimpse of the splendors of Vienna, as the train left the platform, the view from the window transformed into staggeringly pretty vistas. The four-and-a-half-hour journey was filled with picture postcard scenery as the high-speed train traversed through verdant countryside landscapes, charming villages, with their cute cottages and historical landmarks.
Amongst the several stoppages en route was the historic town of Salzburg. It was on my bucket list, but was unable to visit. I was quite tempted to get down there and explore, but since there wasn’t any plan or reservations done, so skipped.
In the previous train journeys food was included, and I enjoyed the luxury of being served warm, delicious food and drinks in the cozy comforts of high-speed trains. The in-between snacks were a surprise perk and a great pass time.
This time though the pantry car and availability of food was a let down. Most of the hot, fresh food and beverages were over. There were very limited options left, that too of packaged snacks, that I don’t prefer.
I was craving for a hot chocolate drink and that was over. Something that I relish immensely, not just for its creamy, lip-smacking taste but also the fact that it aided in keeping me warm from the cold weather. Had to settle for the insipid, tasteless tea instead!
It didn’t even seem as if I was traveling from one country to another in Europe, except on crossing the border from Austria to Germany, when uniformed border police personnel were there inside the train for passport checking. I didn’t know about it, luckily had my passports in my handbag and not packed in the suitcase.
From the numerous connecting flights that I took, this was a different experience. A desirable change, rather than flitting in and out of airports. Holidaying at a slow, relaxed pace, that lifted my spirits.

Words by Boris Fishman and Alex HalberstadtPhotographs by Francesca Catastini
THE SLATE-COLORED JANUARY MORNING drummed cold rain against the windows of Café Prückel. My friend Boris and I had arrived on the red-eye from JFK two hours before. He wanted to sleep; I wanted to go to Prückel, and he’d reluctantly agreed.
Vienna is renowned for its cafés. There’s the toothache-inducing gilt of Café Central, the faux-bohemian shabbiness of Café Hawelka, the raspberry-bordello color scheme of Café Sacher. But my first destination in Vienna is always Café Prückel. Like the more central cafés, it, too, is overseen by taciturn middle-aged men in poly-blend tuxedos. (Viennese servers do not subsist on tips, a fact reflected in their unhurried gait and refreshing disinclination to smile.) But it’s more spacious and sparsely populated, always making me feel pleasurably left alone. Multilingual newspapers hang along the walls, and soft-boiled eggs arrive in eggcups alongside good espresso, and the light streaming in through tall windows invites you to dig your shoulders into the upholstery and linger.
Across the table, Boris didn’t seem to share my enthusiasm. But it wasn’t because I’d kept him from a soft mattress. “It’s like a Soviet cafeteria,” he said, poking unhappily at the cold cuts that had arrived along with the eggs. He surveyed the vast dining area, which, admittedly, did have a wood-paneled wall or two. “The bourgeois version.” I suspected that this was partly why I loved it.
I first came to Vienna when I was 9, a refugee fleeing the Soviet Union. My mother, her parents, and I shared a rundown hotel suite somewhere on the city’s edge. It was the first stop on the journey that would eventually take us to New York, and Vienna was our first encounter with what everyone in the Soviet Union referred to, usually in a whisper, as the West.
Beginning in the late ’60s, hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking refugees passed through Vienna on their way west, mainly to Israel and the United States. Concerned about the appearance of losing so many citizens, Soviet officials preferred to release their refugees to an intermediary nation — and its neutrality made Austria a logical choice. I suppose what I remember most about those weeks in 1979 is a peculiar mixture of emotions: sheer confusion; exhilarated discovery; the distinct embarrassment of being a stranger in what felt like a more civilized civilization; and the recent loss of everything and everyone familiar save a handful of loved ones, a presentiment cushioned for me by the fact of my childhood.
But my most indelible memories of Vienna were of café interiors, especially the vitrines filled with pristine geometric pastries that looked to us like they were made by Fabergé — they were all the more compelling because, subsisting on an allowance from a refugee-resettlement agency, we couldn’t afford to taste them. Now, decades later, I could — and did, an architectural piece of strudel surrounded by a moat of vanilla sauce. I was finishing a book about three generations of my family and wanted to find some vestige of our passage, and of my former self. On this, my fifth visit to Vienna in ten years, I wanted to know one more thing: Why did the city pull me to itself so relentlessly?
JANUARY IN VIENNA: I should have known better. But if Alex had proposed the Sahel in August, I probably would have said yes, too. In Alex, I’d finally met, after 29 relatively barren American years, what felt like a doppelgänger. He had experienced the same immigration I had, ten years earlier; it had left him with similar complexes; and he had the same degree of separation from his Russianness and Jewishness that I did.
And I was curious about Vienna. It was where my family and I encountered the West in 1988, when I was 9. No one had told me where we were going or why, but the signs weren’t good. In the months before leaving, as we pawned everything in our apartment and whittled a century in Minsk into one suitcase per person, my sweet, sheltered Soviet life gave way to unspecified terror. (Ordinary people didn’t travel outside the Soviet Union, and those who did certainly never got to return.) On the rail platform of the train to Vienna — it was easier to imagine visiting Mars — my mother wept as if someone had died. Soviet customs had just upended our suitcases and treated itself to my mother’s wedding ring and a set of gold cutlery. My neck burned with a gold necklace concealed under the top button.
Thirty-six hours later, we rolled into a kind of fairy tale. Even poor people seemed to drive Mercedeses. The supermarkets had automatic sliding doors, which my father learned after nearly toppling an emerging Austrian grandma. I gorged on bratwurst oozing with bergkäse cheese and ice cream cylinders wrapped at the ends with striped twine. In this country, the sausages melted like ice cream, and the ice cream came wrapped at the ends like cured sausage! Once, I came across a kitchenware store so beautiful that, my mouth agape, I walked right into the window, my forehead leaving a spot on the glass. We might as well have been rural North Koreans trying to defect to Ibiza. (At our medical checkups, the doctor handed us a diagram that explained that my mother had to consume the pills for her earache orally, not by putting them in her ear, as previous immigrants had been doing in deference to the Soviet habit of treating earaches with ear compresses.) But Vienna — Vienna would do.
Since immigrating, as I Americanized, then de-Americanized to reconnect with my heritage, then pureed both parts of myself into a thoroughly imperfect but more or less livable hash, I thought of Vienna now and then, the way you wonder about what might have been with someone had the timing been better. In places like Austria, I imagined, they didn’t worship “freedom” to the point of anarchy; were less ready to sacrifice morality for profit; did not regard intellectuals with suspicion; and took care of artists — took care of people in general. Alex felt a deeper attachment to our adopted homeland. It was the one part of him that mystified me.
Thirty years earlier, a small number of refugees like us had found a way to remain in Vienna. “What are you all stampeding over there for?” one, named Sasha, kept asking us. He meant America, a word that to us meant more than Shangri-la. Sasha had visited Brooklyn, where we were heading. “What’s it like?” my mother asked. “It’s not like anything,” he said. When we finally encountered it two months later — low-slung, dirty, and gray — we remembered his words. What if I’d spent the last three decades in Vienna, instead? But there’s the fantasy and the cold, gray, wood-paneled truth.
MY FIRST MEMORY OF VIENNA begins aboard an Aeroflot jet, its fuselage painted with a winged hammer and sickle. My mother and I left Moscow in our winter coats, carrying two suitcases containing six changes of clothes, a photo album, and a book of poems by Anna Akhmatova. My mother’s wedding ring and watch were taken in customs. Aboard the plane we were served an unexpectedly luxurious meal of baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and a wedge of soft processed cheese in a foil wrapper that read “Progress!” I remember my mother slipping the metal forks and knives into her coat pockets. An hour into the flight the pilot announced, in German and then in Russian, that the plane had left Soviet airspace. “Meine Damen und Herren…,” the announcement began, and when it was finished one or two passengers, the boldest ones, clapped. At the airport in Vienna, I sat on my suitcase and gaped at a security guard with a German shepherd and a submachine gun. Then I watched a pilot walk out of the gate, his hat embroidered with the six-pointed star of Israel. “Is Austria a capitalist country?” I asked my mother. She said I looked “as scared as a rabbit.”
To revisit a place remembered from childhood is to realize two rather disappointing facts: (1) Most of us recall childhood through a filter of adult sentimentality, and (2) our memories are, at best, undependable — researchers have found that every time we mentally access a memory, our recall of it changes. We confabulate others unwittingly, with a clear conscience. And the more I thought about my weeks in Vienna in the fall of 1979, the more I had to admit that two things had occupied nearly all of my 9-year-old brain: non-Soviet makes of automobiles and eating. Luckily, my interest in cars has waned, but eating remains a preoccupation. The Viennese are preoccupied with it, too, though without the Parisian self-regard or Roman chauvinism.
As in other cities with thriving café cultures, Vienna’s cafés and bars are cognizant of themselves primarily as social spaces. Most are laid out with watching — and being watched — in mind. Some are as flamboyant as stage sets, but all seem attuned to the public pleasures of tribal togetherness or the kind of low-effort nonconformism that sometimes involves an omelet.
Zum Schwarzen Kameel, where Beethoven had emptied a great many cases of red wine, was celebrating its 400th anniversary, and after a long nap to kill jet lag, Boris and I pulled up two hard barstools in its front room. Popular with maximally groomed, rather cruel-looking regulars — it’s a hangout for conservative politicians — it encourages competitive levels of smoking, which remains permitted in restaurants, another vestige of my Soviet past. Kameel is home to one of the country’s most thorough wine cellars and possibly the most rewarding people-watching in town. Boris and I spent a night there drinking cold Grüner Veltliner, happily lost in talk, while men in quilted jackets and creased trousers crowded around the bar, jockeying for another glass of wine. The only solitary figure was an enervated young woman wearing a fox-fur waistcoat and a Chanel bag sitting across from us. She looked like someone had stood her up. She kept her vividly mascaraed eyes fixed in the middle distance and, with jeweled fingers wrapped around her glass, exhaled drafts of smoke in our faces.
I HAD GIVEN ALEX PRÜCKEL, so he agreed to give me “Swimming Pool.” In Mitteleuropa, when it comes to fitness, yoga and spin classes are still the interlopers, and bath complexes the standard. But we didn’t go to the century-old Jörgerbad pool, in the sleepy 17th district, to take the healing waters. I wanted to see whether the comparative generosity of the Austrian state meant better art. For there was going to be art at the pool, commissioned by the nonprofit arts group Brut, a mainstay of the avant-garde scene in Vienna. A performance artist and several confederates were going to use the pool to “expos[e] the audience to the conflicting feelings of safety and uncanniness.” Whatever that meant.
After some horsing around in the pool, the actors went off to perform various oddities. One poured what looked like red food dye into the pool gutter, making me think of chemical attacks and the extreme generosity of Austrian arts funding. (Alex deemed it “quixotic and bad.”) At home, thanks to our new president, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts — the equivalent of two and a half F-15s — was under the knife.
I had become a full-time freelance writer at 24, and it’s possible that I didn’t sleep or eat for the next year or two — I was too terrified for my future. After a year of 16-hour days and seven-day weeks, I had $22,000, a twitching left eyelid, and not one article I could point to as the product of passion instead of expedience. As bizarre as it was, “Swimming Pool” — or the reality that had made it possible — felt quite okay as an alternative. Everyone in attendance was young, attractive, and responsible — the invitation had said to bring one’s own flip-flops, and everyone had. And serious: They gazed upon the circus before us with the utmost solemnity.
After the performance, we ended up at Rebhuhn, a traditional tavern just outside the city center. It served a Platonic version of grandmother food — pike-perch in a white-wine-but-mostly-butter sauce, chestnut “pasta” over cream and lingonberry preserves — but the best thing about Rebhuhn wasn’t the food. At one table, a woman was reading a newspaper. At another, three lavishly dressed women were having what you just knew was their every-Sunday-night klatch. There were 20-somethings and 80-somethings. No one was “doing a concept” to “maximize covers,” no one was trying to pretend to touch my soul so they could scour my wallet.
When I ate out at such a place in New York, I felt guilty for lingering because I was infringing on the server’s opportunity to turn the table, something I felt responsible for because American restaurants didn’t pay their servers a living wage. Nowhere did this economic model feel as insane as at Rebhuhn in Vienna on a Sunday evening. “Vienna,” Alex said in another theft-worthy line as he mopped sauce with a cube of fish, “is cultural Xanax.” In America, I realized, we were undergoing a kind of national seizure, the kind where you’d stopped noticing that your shoulders were up all the time because you’d internalized terrible economic insecurity as the norm. Safety — an uncanny feeling, indeed. Perhaps the Europe I’d been imagining — the Vienna Alex had been telling me about almost since we’d met — wasn’t only a fantasy.
ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE CITY that saturated my childhood imagination: the streets themselves. After growing up in one of the Brezhnev-era apartment towers that surrounded Moscow like a cinder-block forest, Vienna struck me as a marvel from a distant antiquity. In fact, the city was transformed in the 19th century by Emperor Franz Joseph I, and it is his Vienna — neo-Baroque, orderly, martial — that visitors see today. Franz Joseph’s vision lent the city the quality that has stayed with me most as an adult, a quality that no amount of skyscrapers can efface — an officious, comforting solemnity.
It was just off one of these imperial streets that Boris and I spent our most educational outing in Vienna — at Gasthaus Grünauer, a partly hidden local institution with an interior so low-ceilinged and rustic that it could’ve been located in Middle-earth. We were meeting my friends. Jutta Ambrositsch is the city’s most talented winemaker; her husband, Marco, operates the business side of the winery. The restaurant’s third-generation proprietor, Christian Grünauer, owner of one of the most sardonic faces I’d seen, reminisced in unaccented English about 1980s New York, where he waited tables at an Upper East Side Italian restaurant called Elio’s. One of the regulars there was Donald Trump. “He was so afraid of germs that he wouldn’t shake anyone’s hand,” Christian recalled, “but look at him now, slapping backs and kissing babies!”
Christian’s wife, Katja, prepared Mitteleuropean soul food — grilled veal kidneys, delicately breaded loin of pork, pan-fried whole trout — so flavorful it nearly made us forget about the virtual absence of vegetables. The scene got an infusion of chaos and originality with an appearance of a 60-something gent named Xandi: pear-shaped, red-nosed, leering, perversely avuncular. According to Marco, he was famous around town for his copious eating and drinking, and was rumored to be the father or guardian of 13 children. He waded around our table kissing everyone ceremoniously and wetly and doffing an imaginary hat, then sat down among us, uninvited. He proceeded to deliver a theatrical speech to Jutta that I failed to understand fully due to my meager German, but judging by the suddenly tense faces around the table, its content must have been cutting if not downright mean.
Xandi was demonstrating Wiener Schmäh, a local strain of humor distinguished by dark absurdity, glee at your friends’ misfortune, and masking insult with flattery. When I asked Marco about it later, he shrugged and said, “In Vienna, no joke is too insulting.” I knew what he meant. Back in Brooklyn, Xandi’s behavior would have caused my American-born friends to lapse into embarrassed silence. But at my Russian-Jewish family’s dinner table, an imaginative verbal jab is met with laughter and a grudging appreciation of the offender’s wit — and so it was at Grünauer. No wonder I felt at home.
FROM OUR SIX-HOUR MARATHON of eating, drinking, and smoking, the next morning I remembered only one thing, breathed into my ear by an older gentleman of uncertain employment but many opinions. (This was Xandi, Alex told me later.) “You know why Vienna is perfect?” he said. “It’s 10 to 20 years more slow than everywhere else.” He slapped his doughy hands together, dropping a good bit of cigarette ash onto my jeans. “No complications.”
(I may have remembered only this because, irresponsibly, I didn’t take out my reporter’s notebook all night. Alex and I were very different kinds of travel writers, it turned out — I wrote down everything, and he often waited to see what stuck in his mind. I had decided to try it his way.)
How had we gotten to a world where this was true? Where the best places in Europe were economic B-listers (Portugal, Spain) and those behind the curve (Austria)? This had its downsides. Austria had some of the most progressive social-welfare policies in the world, but you could still smoke in bars and restaurants, and it would be wrong to say Viennese dining had completely left the Wiener schnitzel behind. (Changes were coming to the safety net, too — several weeks before we arrived, a center-right/radical-right coalition had taken power promising to slash social benefits.)
Also, the state extended cultural funding more readily to established artistic institutions than independent artists, which meant that the dynamism and dislocation created by upstart projects often found an easier home elsewhere. Vienna felt less international than almost any Western European capital I’d visited, and almost no one in it seemed to resemble — in dress, habit, conversational references — the globalized elite. This cultural concentrate created a heady unpredictability — the cost, perhaps, of visiting a place like itself and no other. Prückel, “Swimming Pool,” Rebhuhn, Xandi: Even when mediocre, these experiences felt gloriously unrepeatable elsewhere.
GOING OVER THAT NIGHT THE FOLLOWING MORNING, a last scene came into focus: We were at Café Anzengruber, a spot popular with writers and insomniacs, operated by members of a large Croatian clan. Xandi and a pair of young chefs soon appeared. The owner, Tomi, seemed occupied mostly with taunting his defeated-looking brother-in-law, who kept to himself behind the bar. Tomi brought bottles of Croatian Graševina and schnapps and God knows what else and sat down at the table, toasting extravagantly, and soon we were staggeringly drunk. All of us, that is, except Jutta — she sat grinning shyly and a little remorsefully among seven unlaced, hammered men. Something about her expression brought me back to a scene in my childhood kitchen, where my father and four of his friends shared loud, vodka-lubricated enthusiasms about Levi’s jeans and Edgar Winter records, with my mother functioning as the scene’s unmoving, silent axis.
Later, when I related this memory to Julya Rabinowich, one of the country’s best-known authors, she let out an exasperated guffaw. “When it comes to gender equality, Austria is 50 years behind Germany or France,” she said. Despite being a liberal stronghold, Vienna didn’t provide enough day care to meet public demand, Rabinowich explained, forcing many young mothers to stay at home. As in the country of my birth, all too many men here still expected women to handle the majority of the cooking and child care. I was realizing that, culturally, Vienna shared nearly as much with Warsaw-Pact Eastern Europe as it did with the Western democracies. I found much of that kinship problematic, but I couldn’t deny that for me it made Vienna feel as familiar and comfortable as an old blazer. At last, I was deciphering what drew me to this city: It offered much of the essence and manners of my homeland, amid the relative safety and freedom of my home.
In Rabinowich I found something like a double, whose life diverged from mine in ways that interested me. We were born several months apart; her family immigrated from the Soviet Union two years before mine did, but chose to settle in Vienna. I told Rabinowich that, after arriving as a child in New York, I’d felt almost instantly American. “When I was going to school here, no one allowed me to forget I was a foreigner,” she replied. “On the other hand, the government paid for my education, awarded me a stipend that allowed me to write full time, and honored my books with prizes.” We were drinking coffee in a quiet, pretty café in the city’s third district, where everyone seemed to know her by name. Rabinowich, who writes a newspaper column about politics, lamented that the recent election represented “a sharp turn to the right.” She sighed. “But of course I consider myself an Austrian,” she said. “If I leave, I’ll be in exile.”
FOR ALL THE SINCERITY OF MY SEARCHING, there was very little of 1988 Vienna left to discover. Forced to remain neutral as a condition of Soviet withdrawal after the war, Austria didn’t fully accede to the European Union until the mid-1990s. “When I went to Germany in the ’80s, I carried such lists of things to buy that my German friends would jokingly ask me if I wasn’t coming from East Germany rather than Austria,” as one person told me. But once Austria joined the EU, it didn’t look back. The modest pension where my family had stayed seemed to no longer exist, and the street where it was supposedly located listed no store of kitchen supplies.
So it felt like a miracle when it turned out that the two refugee-aid agencies that had shepherded us to America, the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), had representatives in Vienna that had been around for the great Soviet-refugee influx 30 years earlier. (Both agencies continue to serve refugee populations.) Alex and I met them for coffee at Café Frauenhuber, a tourist-district café that miraculously few tourists seem to know about. (Mozart had given his last public performance upstairs, in 1791. Vienna is like that.) And all of a sudden, I was sitting in front of two men whom I very well may have had already met, half a lifetime before.
“I had no time to go to the washroom,” Walter Juraschek, who was with HIAS, said. The child of World War II Polish refugees, he had been made for the work, and began his days at 3 a.m., coaching atheist Soviet people like my parents and grandparents on how to say the right things about Jewish identity to the American consular officers. (Religious persecution was a precondition for refugee status.) HIAS shared an office with the JDC, and Juraschek remembers the waiting rooms and corridors so packed that muscling his way back and forth to his desk proved a daily challenge. He ran interference with the authorities, such as the police officer who had his arm broken by an iron-swinging woman who thought he was coming to arrest her. When the Danish Embassy turned away a Soviet refugee who hoped to emigrate there, Juraschek bombarded the queen of Denmark with letters until she personally intervened.
Inspired by the meeting, I strayed toward the spot on the map that showed the location of the Stadttempel, the main synagogue in Vienna, located in a warren of streets known as the Bermuda Triangle. During my family’s stay in 1988, we’d been taken by the JDC to get a glimpse of the exterior, as holiday services were in progress inside. My grandfather had not come all that way to look at a facade, so he grabbed my hand, split off from the group, and, me at his waist (I still remember the naphthalene smell of his slacks), prised open the heavy wood door. Inside, we saw something we’d never seen in our atheist homeland: Orthodox Jewish men praying. “Fanatics!” he said, not without affection, and winked at me.
True to the promise of the Bermuda Triangle, there was nothing but the backside of an ornate building where the map said the synagogue would be. It didn’t seem like I was meant to find even this — something that definitely still existed. But then, wandering up a side street, I saw it. Or rather the police van that, sadly, so often signals a Jewish place of worship in Europe these days. Who knew if those were the same wood doors my grandfather and I had touched, but their location was the same. As I stood alone in that alley, not wanting to approach them for fear of my intentions being mistaken — I look Middle Eastern — what I was seeing would have to be good enough. And what I was feeling — my grandfather had passed away a month before I’d arrived in Vienna.
ON THE MORNING AFTER the euphoric, drunken night at Grünauer, Jutta drove Boris and me to see her vineyards on the city’s northernmost edge. As we were getting into her Audi, a Japanese tour group emerged from the U-Bahn station nearby, and a woman in a pantsuit leading the tour suddenly shrieked, “Jutta Ambrositsch!” She introduced us excitedly to the group in rapid-fire Japanese. The tourists reacted to this by surrounding us and bursting into applause.
It was an unseasonably cold, foggy day, and Boris and I ended up tramping through muddy vineyards behind Jutta and her elderly fox terrier, Edgar. The view made up for the mud. Standing among the vines on a hill called Nussberg, we looked out over downtown Vienna, anchored by the jutting, silly Millennium Tower, and finally got a sense of the Danube’s massive span. Yet the city was inaudible — we heard only birds. “I live in the city center and I’m a 20-minute drive from the vineyards,” Jutta marveled, pulling a patched hunting jacket tighter around her. “Where else can you do that?”
As a respite from the cold fog and my hurricane-grade hangover, I went to the Kunsthistorisches Museum to see the Bruegels. I spent a long while in the picture gallery on the second floor, looking at ten large panels. Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s village landscapes refuse to be read as religious allegory and exist as documents of rural communities. Their portrayal of the Flemish villagers is neither humorous nor moralizing nor idealistic; instead, they’re suffused with an acceptance of the cycles of daily life — with their 16th-century miseries intact — and a compassion that borders on the post-human.
I stood in front of Hunters in the Snow and remembered the feeling of first seeing it as a 9-year-old. I could picture myself standing beside my mother in that gallery nearly 40 years earlier; the memory was as detailed as though it had happened last week. Later I sat down at a café amid the museum’s imperial-chocolate-cake decor and ordered coffee and a piece of strudel. Then I called my mother in New York. I told her excitedly where I was, and described what I remembered. She listened patiently. “The admission to that museum was expensive,” she said finally. “So we didn’t go. What you remember never happened.”
ON THE BROKEN-HEADED MORNING after our bacchanal, what Vienna calls coffee — an espresso shot lost in a trough of milk and foam — was not going to suffice. I needed rocket fuel, and, feeling morning-after shame of a different kind, headed for the only solution I could imagine: a Starbucks. There, I did something I’ve never done even in America: I ordered a venti. It was only five minutes back to my rental, but it was five minutes longer than necessary to register the horrified stares of rush-hour Vienna at the RPG in my hands.
In the weeks to come, after Alex and I returned to New York, it would be this moment I’d remember more than any other from the trip, crystals of nostalgia forming almost in real time. But no matter how sweet and less mixed my recollections of Vienna became, the feeling never alchemized into a readiness to consider moving there — or anywhere. Having spent so many years looking toward Europe with longing, I’d failed to register just how American I was becoming — if not always ideologically, then due simply to years of being able to order mediocre coffee in three sizes. It isn’t that you can’t go home again. It’s that once you’ve lost it, every place is just what another place isn’t.
That morning, our last, Alex’s friend Jutta was driving us to the 19th district, a posh enclave on the edge of the city that dead-ends in acres of vineyards, including her own. Afterward, at lunch, I told her about my Vienna history. When I mentioned the kitchenware store I’d walked into, she lit up. “It’s called Ostovics!” she said. “There’s one right near Neubaugasse,” the street where I’d told her our pension may have been located. Memory is as vague as it is rigid. It hadn’t occurred to me that the kitchenware store might be on a nearby street.
I had an interview after lunch, but I raced to Ostovics afterward. I remembered floor-to-ceiling windows rather than its glass recessed in a brick enclosure. But the pots and serving dishes behind the glass were painted as beautifully as artworks and actually lived up to the gleam in my memory. I looked around — no one. I’d been feeling regret that I’d not gone up to touch the synagogue doors. (How observantly Jewish, ironically, my investment of that touch with such talismanic power.) So I went up to the Ostovics window and, feeling like a lunatic, brought my forehead to it, like all those years ago. It was cold and dry outside, and the touch left no trace.

My first touch with Vienna was in April during my first tour of Europe. The idea was to support the launch of my book about webpack and see some new places. I never intended the trip to lead to a cascade that would change my life, but that’s what ended up happening.
Perhaps the biggest reason for that was the fact that I made new friends and began to see myself in a different light. I have an introverted past, and I fit the stereotype of a nerd well. The first trip began a still ongoing change that’s rewriting me as a person.
I encountered Vienna by chance. I was given an option to give a presentation at React Vienna to conclude the tour. As a curious person, I decided to take the chance. I felt welcomed by the community instantly, and I felt comfortable during the two-hour session.
As I happened to have some free time in Vienna, I explored the city. I’ve learned that one way to get to know the local people is to go to meetups. Even though I am/was an introvert, my curious side tends to win over my natural shyness.
It’s in one of these meetups where I met someone who I consider a true friend now. We connected on an intellectual level and this grew into a deep, personal friendship. The fact that we met is mostly due to chance, but sometimes you have to get lucky to change the direction of your life.
It’s this relationship and the local community that has dragged me to Vienna over and over again. It’s a gift that keeps giving. I keep refining myself and the way I think through the constant interactions I have with the city and its residents.
I believe to get to know a city, you have to spend a long time in it. I decided to try with Vienna as I wanted to see if it’s as good city for me as it felt like the first times I saw it.
You can see that Vienna was a capital of an empire once. It combines high culture with a high-quality of living. It’s a city where you never get bored as there’s always something to do. Most importantly, nature is near.
Not everything is perfect, but it feels like an excellent compromise for me as I could have a lifestyle fitting me here while maintaining valuable personal connections.
The idea behind spending a Summer month in Vienna was simple: recharge batteries, build contacts, develop business, prepare for September presentations at ReactNext and WebExpo. I didn’t intend to change as a person much, but that happened more as a side effect.
This year has made me realize that I have lived a sheltered albeit safe life. But is that a good way to live? I’m in the best condition of my life in many ways. Excellent health and certain skills allowed me to grow myself a decent business and generate a lot of opportunities, but I always felt perhaps something is missing.
It’s easy to live your life in a bubble as you follow a certain routine without questioning. Technically that works, and it worked for me, but what if there is more to life than that? This is the question I began to ask myself more and more, and it feels like Vienna allowed me to find some answers while giving new questions.
You could say I haven’t felt much since the primary school. You shed your last pieces of emotion while you go through the army indoctrination mandatory to Finnish men. The stereotype of a man is not to show emotion in public unless it’s related to sports. Perhaps it’s not so good stereotype after all.
Strangely enough spending time in Vienna began to make me feel more alive than before. As I saw more and more people, I started to get out of my shell. I am still reserved but far less so and I actually enjoy my life instead of settling for what I have. It’s simply amazing I get to do something I like while getting paid well enough to sustain my lifestyle.
I even began to meet people of my opposite sex only to realize that’s the world I know embarrassingly little about. Doing this has given me life lessons that will stick with me for a long while. You can read all the self-help books you want, but sometimes it’s real life that teaches you the most even if it might be painful at times and might force you to feel new emotions.
I still have a long way to go on this road of discovery. I feel as if I was unchained. For me to achieve this, I had to lose my old environment and go far beyond my comfort zone. It’s a path I chose, and I have no idea where it leads, but I am happy to have chosen it.
I find it interesting that starting to do something humble like writing a book to help other people transformed my entire life. First I grew a small business only to realize there’s more to life. And now I’m living the next stage in which I’m discovering what that more is.
During this stage, I will hopefully learn to balance personal side with business as in personal business these two are interrelated. There is no one without another as I’ve come to understand.
I feel as if I gained years worth of life experience by spending a month in Vienna and by being curious enough. I am more aware than ever that I have to grow and develop personally. Perhaps this was the reboot I needed for future success in both business and on a personal level.
For me the conclusion is clear. There’s life beyond computers and business.

The background to my being in Austria in the first place: family. My parents were immigrants to the United States where I was born and grew up. They returned to their home country at some point, which I wasn’t happy about. Long story short: My relationship with this city is ambivalent. I hated it when we first arrived from sunny southern California. It was a completely different world. Over the years, things have changed and a certain cool factor exists plus I love classical music so it’s not the worst place to be spending time.
Here are some cool and weird facts about Vienna along with some of my experiences. Some apply to Austria. Other odd factoids are typically Viennese you won’t find anywhere else.

Vienna, the capital of Austria, stands as a city that seamlessly blends a rich historical legacy, vibrant culture, and a spirit of innovation. It has earned a well-deserved reputation for offering an exceptional quality of life to both its residents and visitors. Notably, Vienna has consistently secured the top spot as the world’s most livable city in esteemed international studies and rankings, such as the Global Livability Index 2022 by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Mercer Quality of Living Survey 2022. But what distinguishes Vienna and enables it to maintain this remarkable achievement for two consecutive years? In this article, we will explore the key factors that contribute to Vienna’s unparalleled livability and unveil the myriad ways in which you can personally immerse yourself in its captivating allure.
Vienna’s public transportation system adds to its allure as an exceptional city to reside in. The city takes pride in its secure and efficient network that not only promotes sustainability and physical well-being but also effectively mitigates traffic congestion. A comprehensive range of buses, trams, trains, and metro lines seamlessly connect every corner of Vienna and its surrounding areas. Moreover, Vienna provides dedicated bike lanes, convenient car-sharing programs, and electric scooters to facilitate eco-friendly mobility options throughout the region. With the convenience of a single ticket applicable to all modes of transportation within the city limits, Vienna’s public transportation system not only offers cost-effectiveness but also remarkable practicality. According to a Eurostat report, Vienna surpasses the European average with an impressive 39% share of public transportation trips, underscoring its commitment to efficient and sustainable transportation solutions. For a seamless and stress-free commute in Vienna, rely on its dependable public transport system to take you where you need to be.
Vienna’s healthcare system stands as a cornerstone of its exceptional standard of living. Regardless of nationality or income level, all residents have access to cost-free, top-tier healthcare services. A network of highly qualified medical professionals, well-stocked pharmacies, and destigmatized mental healthcare facilities ensure the well-being of the city’s inhabitants. In the Euro Health Consumer Index report, Austria claims the ninth spot among European nations for healthcare outcomes, showcasing the effectiveness of the system. Whether seeking routine check-ups, prescription refills, or specialized treatments, Vienna’s healthcare system guarantees the provision of optimal care and unwavering support.
Vienna emerges as an extraordinary city, widely acclaimed for its remarkably low crime rates, solidifying its stature as an emblem of security and tranquility in Europe. Instances of violent crimes, including acts like homicide, assault, and robbery, manifest themselves exceptionally rarely in Vienna, thereby amplifying the city’s thoroughly deserved repute for safety. Furthermore, Vienna proudly displays an outstanding track record of minimal property crimes, encompassing theft, vandalism, and burglary. This remarkable feat can be ascribed to the city’s unflinching dedication to public safety, which encompasses a vigilant police force, an efficient justice system, and a profound sense of social cohesion among its residents.

Tuesday and Wednesday, May 6 and 7
This may be a long post because it covers two days. We are greeted by the Empress Maria Theresa, one of the rare female monarchs we have encountered. The Viennese speak warmly of her and I believe she had a long and peaceful reign. She also had 16 (!) children, one being Marie Antoinette. They were all intermarried, it seems.
There is another monarch, Empress Elizabeth, whose life was much more complicated, but more about her later.
To be honest, I have taken so many pictures of so many buildings that I can’t remember three days later which is which. I just want to give you a sense of each place. All of the cities started with the Celts, then Vikings, then the Roman Empire. Only rare bits of Roman roads and buildings can be seen.
The streets are narrow and curved in the medieval style. The buildings are from later periods. Many have been rebuilt because of WW II.
In Germany the Renaissance style buildings were over the top, like Baroque and Rococo. But Vienna is a little more subdued. It is spacious and grand and elegant without overwhelm.
So here are a few pictures of various buildings and statues. The only thing I can discern is when I’m taking pictures of a church.
This is not a church. This is the old city gate and its alcove, home to the Sisi Museum and the Lippizaner Museum ( the famous dancing white horses).
Speaking of horses, they have horse drawn carriages you can ride? But we didn’t do this.
What was cool was that the horses all had these decorative head pieces that covered their ears. I guess it gets cold in Vienna in the winter.
This is the Imperial Palace in Vienna, which has a ridiculous number of rooms.
This is some statue monarch made to associate himself with God. I’m not sure if was to honor God or himself, but there was that “divine right of kings” thing going centuries ago. And then you remember all the Prince Bishops… so much intertwining of religious and political power.
I was surprised that a truck drove through a pedestrian area! I didn’t expect that.
Street food.
Now this really surprised me. Here is this beautiful building covered with an advertisement. I looked closed and this is actually a fabric painting reproducing the building; it hides the scaffolding and the ad helps disguise the fabric covering. You don’t even notice it’s fake. A disguise of a disguise.
This is a church. I think it’s St. Stephen’s.
Note the beautiful tiled roof.
It’s always hard to get a picture of the whole church but I got this replica.
Pictures of inside the church follow.
And there is always a gift shop.
After the official tour we decided to go wander around Vienna. Chocolate, anyone? ( I’m talking to you, Abby.) They gave samples, like at an ice cream store.
This made us hungry so we stopped in a coffee shop and of course you need a pastry to go along with your coffee. Even Chappell drank coffee in honor of the tradition.
Interesting sights along the way. Bicycles often have a large front container to carry groceries or to ferry children. If they ferry children they have little car seats with seat belts.
Poor dog!
(Rachel I know. I don’t have many dogs here but not as many people have dogs and they don’t let you pet them.)
Chappell asked me what I wanted to do next. I wanted to go to the Sisi Museum. I’m sure Jeremy knows all about this because he knows about everything. I had never heard of her but she had a tragic life. I am told it is now a Netflix series called “Princess Elizabeth.”
When you go into the museum the first thing you see a is a plaster death mask. She was quite poetic and expressed her melancholy in her journals. They were posted on the walls throughout.
“But mournfully I spread my wide, white wings, return home to the fairy kingdom and nothing shall bring me back again.”
“I am Sunday’s child, a child of the sun. Her golden rays she wove into my throne; with her glow she wove her crown. It is her light that I live, but should she ever wane from me, I must die.”
Sisi grew up in Bavaria out in the countryside. It was an idyllic childhood. She is the little girl in each of these pictures.
This is a bust of her at age 10. She grew into a beautiful young woman who was known for her beautiful hair.
These were some of her Crown Jewels.
And some of her ball gowns.
Her fan
These were her staterooms.
And her personal exercise room.
And her bedroom
Sisi lived a very sad life. She hated the constraints of the court and its duties, but her real torture was her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law was terribly overbearing and ruled with an iron fist.
Even so, the couple was reasonably happy. Sisi was away on a state visit with her husband when their child died at age 6. That caused a rift in their marriage that was never repaired. Sisi began traveling throughout Europe without her husband; she seemed to have given up on her son and left him behind to the “care” of his mother-in-law. (Sisi’s son Rudolph was a disaster, probably as a result of his horrible upbringing.) Sisi, herself, wore black during these sad, later years.
“Elizabeth’s incessant traveling is increasingly characterized by unease and restlessness. The “lady in black” constantly sought to escape the burden of her own personality and was prey to profound melancholy.”
At age 61 she was assassinated by an anarchist who just wanted to create some chaos. She was never meant to be the target, but she was at the wrong place at the wrong time. What a tragic life.
The next day we woke up with a boat gas station and attendant right outside our balcony. I had never thought about the need to fuel up or how they would do that. I’d love to know more about all the behind the scenes workings of the ship.
Chappell had gone to the Schonnbrun Palace (the summer residence), so I had the morning to myself. I had been thinking about going to the Klint Museum but couldn’t get an appointment that didn’t conflict with a planned afternoon tour of the Vienna Boys Choir. So I just spent a sunny morning in the lounge. (This is also where I caught up on my posts.)
This was the view of modern Vienna on the opposite bank from the old city. It’s all very new and modern.
That afternoon I took a trip to the home of the Vienna Boys choir, but it’s more than one choir of boys.
It functions as a boarding school set in a beautiful old neighborhood in Vienna.
These are the formal gardens.
Everything is “old Vienna.”
The choir has been in existence since before 1500 and was always supported by the royalty. During these centuries the boys were dressed as little soldiers in the king’s army. After the fall of the monarchy the uniforms were changed to sailor suits. This was not because they had a navy but because sailor suits were normal attire for children at that time.
We were escorted into an oval room with perfect acoustics and serenaded by 18 boys in the choir.
Of course the music was angelic. Their voices were were so pure and clear. I think I will never forget the sound of their voices.
I had hoped for that but I learned things I never expected.
They started the performance with “There’s no business like show business” which was quite a surprise. They sang a wide range of music as a group, with occasional solos and duets.
The children are from all over the world and tour all over the world. It was touching to see a Russian boy and a Ukrainian boys singing side by side. It was perhaps appropriate because their last song was “We are the world, we are the children.” They consider themselves as ambassadors.
They are more than a boys choir. There is a non-residential elementary school for children ages 6–10, with quite an emphasis on music. If the children show an interest and aptitude, there are simple auditions for admission to the residential middle school and choir for ages 10–14.
There are actually four choirs of about 24 boys each. Each choir is named after a great composer, such as the Brahms choir, the Mozart choir, etc. One choir is always on tour while the other choirs have school. There is also a girls’ choir for ages 10–14 with their own conductor. The girls attend the school but go home at night; a dormitory for them is being planned. Their is now a high school, so the children can continue their education and be part of the youth choir. Some stay, but others opt for a normal high school life (if such a thing exists).
It’s good to know, though, that they have a normal life. I got this photo of some of the boys were playing soccer. They still get to be kids.

Despite its size, Austria’s capital has the feel of a large town. According to global rankings, Vienna is one of the most livable cities in the world. Because of excellent public services, economic success, and low crime rates. At the time of writing, Vienna had been named the world’s unfriendliest city. Don’t you think it’s a bit contentious?
Here are some useful hints and details about Vienna, Austria, as well as driving directions. We can say that getting around Vienna is a breeze.
The city is divided into 23 districts. A neighborhood that surrounds the “Ringstraße” — Ring street.
By simply walking down this street, you can see many sights in Vienna.In the past, fortifications guarding the city stood where Ringstraße now stands.
Austrians frequently refer to districts by their numbers. “I live in the first!” or “I have to travel to the tenth tomorrow!” you might hear. Isn’t that not at all Germans?
You can tell which district you are in by looking at the number on the street name sign.

With the greatest of delights I just realised something: all my life, I have been living in Red Cities — cities with a Socialist history. All the cities I loved and lived in — Ghent in Belgium, Jerusalem in Israel, Firenze in Italy, and now Vienna — were, and sometimes still are, fiery red, and proud of it.
I have been in Vienna for nearly fifteen years now, and I have gradually discovered a place and a history that traditional travel guides won’t tell you much about. Yet this Rotes Wien is visible everywhere, in every district you visit and on nearly every street you walk through.

For the first time in a long time,
I feel like myself again.
Not the version I had to shrink to be loved,
not the one who stayed quiet to keep the peace,
not the girl who called the bare minimum “enough.”
She walked through hell,
but I left her there —
with the people who fed off her silence
and mistook her kindness for weakness.
Now, I’m done explaining,
done waiting to be chosen,
done carrying weight that was never mine.
I’ve never felt so *light.*
There’s sunlight in my bones again,
a laugh I don’t have to fake,
and dreams I’m finally letting breathe.
Next week: Florida.
Me and my friends, chasing the sun,
singing too loud, dancing barefoot,
and soaking in every golden hour like it’s a promise.
Then — Europe.
A one-way ticket and no return date.
No plan but joy.
No map but instinct.
I want to get lost on purpose.
To fall in love with places, moments, and maybe even myself again.
To write my story across coastlines and cafés,
with no one’s voice in my head but mine.
This summer isn’t an escape —
it’s a return.
To who I was before the noise.
To who I’ve *always* been, underneath the wreckage.
And this time,
I’m not just moving on —
I’m moving *up.*
Unapologetically.
Unstoppably.
Unforgettably.
With love (and finally, freedom),
**Me**

It’s hard to believe I’ve in Vienna over a year. As 2023 closes, I wanted to recap my experiences here over the last 15 months or so.
The Apartment I am so glad I decided on an apartment closer to the center and not closer to work. Though we do have hybrid work, our office is on the edge of Vienna heading west. Living close to the center gives me a huge number of options for food, shopping and culture. I can walk to the center of Vienna in about 25 minutes. The area I live in is one of the best areas in Vienna for shopping, food and the main museums are close by (District 6: Mariahilf).  Altogether Vienna is truly a great place to live. It was again voted world’s most livable city this year.
The Culture & The Food There is so much to see and do here. And I’ve seen many museums, cafés, restaurants, parks and more. Yet I still feel almost overwhelmed with choices. Here are some of my favorites:
My favorites museums are: Art History Museum (center, gorgeous building), the World Museum (center), and the Klimt Villa (which is a mansion built over Gustav Klimt’s original workspace; it has a lovely…

One solid reason why peeps head to Vienna, very, is because of its old buildings and totally awesome design work. From the flashy Schönbrunn Palace to the grand St. Stephen’s Cathedral with its super old style, Vienna’s loaded with famous spots showing off its super rich past. Each spot there, kind of tells stories from when the city had kings and queens, providing like, a little look into royal stories.

"“Red Vienna”: the most liveable city on Earth, and why we need to be good ancestors",https://medium.com/@nickydromey60/red-vienna-the-most-liveable-city-on-earth-and-why-we-need-to-be-good-ancestors-d7ff11d16d19,"Sign up

“Are we being good ancestors?”. This was the question posed by the American virologist Jonas Salk in 1955, after developing the first effective vaccine against polio. He refused to patent the vaccine, missing out on millions in earnings, believing that the best way to become a good ancestor was to give it away to anyone who needed it.
Long-term thinking, and becoming a good ancestor, does not come naturally to humanity. Corporate executives are flustered about quarterly reports, and seek the dopamine hit of immediate growth rather than implementing a long-term strategy. Political leaders focus on the next set of parliamentary elections, rather than worry about long-term issues, such as the climate crisis or sustainable development. Far too often, we are consumed by the “tyranny of now”, rather than the “power of yet”, to use Carol Dweck’s phrase.
We see this in Ireland, and its attitude to housing. Last year, there was a lot of chat in the media about the €750 tax credit for renters, announced in the last budget. I appreciate this, but it does nothing to address the real problem — lack of supply. Everybody in this country, except possibly legislators in the Dáil, knows that there is an acute shortage of housing here.
No tax credit ever built a house or an apartment. It also means nothing to the person that can’t find a property to rent in Dublin or Cork. This example of the “tyranny of now”, which the coalition government may be using to gain voters for next year’s general election, needs to be replaced with a longer-term strategy, the “power of yet”. One city provides an example of such a strategy.
In this essay, I discuss Vienna, a city that used the “power of yet” to fix a housing crisis 100 years ago. Immigration exacerbated the city’s housing shortage, leaving hundreds of thousands of Viennese living without running water or toilet facilities. I will tell you about “Red Vienna”, and how a left-wing municipal government built a “Ring Road of the Proletariat”, without creating crime-ridden communities. I will also show you how this legacy endures today — today, Vienna is the most liveable city in the world. Viennese policymakers from 100 years ago are rightly remembered as good ancestors; Irish policymakers could be as well.

Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the First World War, Vienna, then home to 2 million people, found itself in a desperate situation. Wartime rationing and inflation had left middle-class professionals and businessowners on the brink of starvation and vulnerable to infectious diseases. Vienna, once the sparkling capital of a multi-ethnic empire, home to Croats, Slovenes, Czechs, Poles, and of course Austrians and Hungarians, was now an overcrowded city within a war-ravaged state. The treaty of Saint-Germain, signed in 1919, explicitly forbade the new German-speaking republic from unifying with Germany, enraging socialists and nationalists alike.
Vienna, now home to 28% of the population of the newly established Republic of Austria, lacked basic amenities, such as food and clothing, largely due to trade embargos imposed on it by the Triple Entente. Hyperinflation rendered War Bonds worthless, eliminating the savings of the middle and upper classes. Supply chains to Vienna from its empire were cut off by the existence of new borders, making the supply of food even more difficult. Communists and fascists in the city stirred up working-class grievances, leading to strikes and political violence.
Just as we see in the English-speaking world today, Vienna had a chronic shortage of affordable housing. Over 250,000 Viennese workers lived in small apartment blocks, known as “Bassena”, with no access to running water. Many of Vienna’s “Bettgeher” (“bed lodgers”) lived in rent-by-the-room accommodations, in which residents could only sleep in their beds for half of the day, effectively sleeping in shifts. These units lacked windows or toilet facilities, depriving renters of cleanliness and sunlight. The units weren’t even cheap; a 2022 study from MIT calculated that rent could cost up to 25% of a family’s income. These unsanitary yet expensive homes remind me of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old child who died from exposure to mould in a flat in Rochdale in England last year.
Like Ireland today, Vienna’s housing shortage came in response to an influx of immigrants. Between 1880 and 1910, its total number of inhabitants jumped from 726,000 to over 2 million, placing it on a par with Paris and Berlin. For instance, Jewish immigrants, granted full citizenship by the Empire in 1867, flocked to the city from Hungary, Moravia and Galicia. The names of the new arrivals read like a who’s who of fin-de-siècle European intellectual life: Sigmund Freud was born in Moravia, before moving to the city with his family when he was four years old. Theodor Herzl, the founder of the modern Zionist movement, was born in Budapest, before arriving in Vienna to study law.
3.
In 1919, the city held its Gemeinderat (Municipal Elections), electing as its mayor the socialist Jakob Reumann. Reumann, a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria (SDAP), made the then-innovative decision to build 25,000 units subsided public housing for Austrian workers, financed by progressive taxes on land and luxury goods, such as champagne and cars. About 40 percent of the costs of building the houses came from taxes on upper-class properties. From 1919 to 1933, the city council was the only entity that built new homes.
In 1927, construction began on Karl-Marx-Hof (literally “Karl Marx Court”). Finished in 1930, it was designed by Karl Ehn, an architect and socialist who apprenticed under Otto Wagner, a native of Vienna, and founder of the Art Nouveau architectural movement. The Karl-Marx-Hof consisted of green spaces, play areas and amenities such as a pharmacy and a post office. Comprised of 1,382 apartments, and designed for a population of about 5,000, it spanned about 1.2 kilometres in length, making it the longest single residential buildings in the world. Other hofe, such as Engelshof, Bebelhof, and George-Washington-Hof, emerged during the same period. Public baths like the Amalienbad, opened in 1926, provided proper sanitation for lower-class Viennese, as well as a safe place to socialise.
Just as NIMBYists (not-in-my-back-yard) today warn that increasing the supply of social housing will create a new generation of “school dropouts, drug users, non-workers and criminals”, there was a moral panic around the provision of housing in Vienna too. The taxes needed to finance their construction were viciously opposed by “Black Vienna”, which consisted of conservative landowners and leaders, monarchists, anti-Semites and Catholic radicals. They whined about “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”, potentially effective dog whistles in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
As noted previously, the planners of “Red Vienna” were followers of Otto Wagner and his Art Nouveau movement. The Art Nouveau style, used to design Viennese buildings such as the Majolica House and the Secession Building, used intricate patterns, curving lines, and the use of materials like glass, ceramics and iron. Using similarly elaborate patterns helped to make the new apartment blocks, spanning the “Ring Road of the Proletariat” on Margaretengurtel in southern Vienna, look like upper-class dwellings. Harvard historian Eve Blau sums up the pragmatic case for beautiful social houses thus: “If you’re planning something radical, it’s not a bad idea to come across as conservative as possible”.
4.
By 1934, the Viennese city council had built about 64,000 apartments, which housed 10% of the city’s population. Like the Karl-Marx-Hof, these too were equipped with everyday amenities. As well as the city’s progressive tax system, this impressive rate of construction was assisted by the city council’s intelligent use of rent controls. First implemented in 1922, rent controls initially disincentivised the private development of private buildings, reducing the price of urban land. The council could then purchase the land at the discounted price and create jobs by building on it.
“Red Vienna” would be suspended in 1934, following the establishment of the Standestaat, a one-party fascist state rendered paranoid by the perceived evils of “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”. Between 1938 and 1945, the country would be occupied by the Nazis, led of course by a genocidal Austrian corporal with a silly moustache. After the war, which left over 20% of the city’s housing stock partially or completely destroyed, the Social Democrats regained power, and “Red Vienna” returned with a vengeance. Projects such as the Per-Albin-Hansson-Siedlung in Favoriten, home to 14,000 residents, came into being. In 1969, Vienna constructed its 100,000th new home since the end of Nazi rule.
Today, over 60% of Vienna’s 1.8 million people live in subsidized housing. Local authorities own and manage about 220,000 housing units, about one-quarter of the city’s total housing stock, and indirectly controls 200,000 units that are owned by private-developers but governed by a city-regulated process. In 1984, the city set up a “Land Procurement and Urban Renewal Fund” that reserves land in the city for affordable homes and amenities — as of 2019, the fund owned over 3 million square metres of land. In 2018, the city passed legislation, requiring that for all housing projects with over 5,000 square metres of space, at least two thirds of the new builds must be subsided. Recent projects include the 850-apartment Wohnpark Neue Donau and the 1,004-unit Kabelwerk estate.
5.
The positive consequences of Vienna’s commitment to housing development are obvious. A 2023 report shows that average rents are just over a quarter those of European cities such as Paris and Oslo. Figures for monthly rents, which by law cannot be more than 25% of a tenant’s income, are often as low as €500 or €600, less than one-third those of Dublin, and can even fall as low as €250 for long-term residents.
It should therefore come as little surprise that Vienna has been selected as the most liveable city in the world in eight of the past ten years by the Economist, including last year. For context, London ranks 34th and Dublin comes in at 37th. This survey takes each city’s accessibility, healthcare, infrastructure and culture into account, and is a testament to the enduring legacy of “Red Vienna” and the “power of yet”.
6.
In this essay, I have described “Red Vienna”, and how it demonstrates the significance of long-term thinking. I have shown you how a formerly impoverished place became the most liveable city on Earth. It is not as if the “power of yet” is entirely foreign to Ireland — in the 1920s, the German company Siemens built the Ardnacrusha Generating Station in County Clare, a project that required almost one-fifth of the Free State’s entire annual budget. The new power station harnessed the waters of the river Shannon to generate about 96% of Ireland’s electricity requirements. The State was poor back then. Now it is estimated that the country will have a €65.2 billion budget surplus by 2027; a pot of gold from foreign multinationals. Let us be good ancestors and spend it.

…Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role…
We had the pleasure of interviewing Martina Huemann. Martina is Professor at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business where she heads the Project Management Group in the Department Strategy and Innovation and is the Academic Director of the Professional MBA Program: Project Management. She has published widely in the fields of Project Management and Human Resource Management. For her Research on Human Resource management in Project-oriented Organisations, she received the IPMA Research Award 2015.
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path?
Born in Vienna, Austria I am currently living between Vienna and London. While in Vienna I am Academic Director of the Vienna Executive MBA: Strategic Project Management and lead the Project Management Group in the Institute of Strategic Management at WU Vienna. For 1,5 years I am a Full Professor of Project Leadership and Society at University College London, Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction.
I am Editor-in Chief of International Journal of Project Management, the leading journal in Project Research and Founding Editor-in-Chief of Project Leadership and Society and hold several board positions in national and international Associations.
I have two children, two boys, one born 1997 and one born 2005.
Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
My career was probably not expected from me. As I was the first one in my family who made it to university. My parents came from a simple background, my mother was educated as a tailor but run a small shop and my father was a warehouse worker for a newspaper. While both not having much formal education, they always gave me the feeling that I can achieve everything what I want.
I also did my studies at WU Vienna and when I entered the building I felt not belonging there, more an alien. I had no role models in my family. However, I decided that I wanted to get more knowledge and a formal education. I studied Business Administration. During the weekends Friday to Sunday night, I worked 20 hours plus in an ice cream shop to contribute to financing my life.
I always having a drive for learning, getting to know something new, but also for visiting other countries and traveling. I am a quite curious person interested in understanding different subjects and contexts, meeting new people and making a difference.
During my studies I spent one semester in Prague and later one semester in Lund Sweden. I was travelling and had the opportunity to engage in different projects, one of those was an EU funded project bringing Didactics to Middle and Eastern Europe countries like Poland, Tech Republic and Slovakia. I was engaged there as a student evaluator. Looking back this got me interested in universities, teachings and in projects and how change can be organised trough projects. Which set the ground also for my interest to research and educate how to manage projects.
When I finally finished my graduate studies, I got a position at a newly established small department at WU focused on Project Management. I supported the establishment of that university unit, its research and education programme. Finally, I received a position funded by the university and started my doctorate in Project Management. I early got involved internationally in the International Project Management Association as I was taken there through my professor. That helped me immensely to build my network.
My first son was born shortly after I received my first university financed position. This caused quite some turbulence. I was questioned by my work environment if family was now my priority and if leaving academia would be better for me. I took a quite short maternity leave and went back to keep my position and finished my doctorate.
My career was only possible with my partner and especially the of my mother and the father of my partner. who helped a lot with the childcare. To make a university career in my context I had to pursue a Habitation, and which set a further milestone in my career that opened the door for my professorship.
Can you share a pivotal moment in your career that significantly influenced your path to leadership?
As an early career researcher, I received a quite tempting invitation to apply for positions at another university abroad. But I decided not to go for it as I would have needed to take the whole family to a different country. It would have been very difficult for my partner to find a job and I felt it was not appropriate to ask my partner and my family to start somewhere new just because of my career aspirations.
This is also the reason why I did my career at WU Vienna. While it was international and I have been engaged in International Associations like International Project Management Association or Project Management Institute, I remained a stable main position at WU Vienna. However as my children are now grown up, I did apply for a professorship at University College London and reduced my position at WU.
Ok, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. According to this report, only about 31.7% of top executive positions across industries are held by women. This reflects great historical progress, but it also shows that more work still has to be done to empower women. In your opinion and experience what is currently holding back women from leadership and management?
Many different issues. Most of them are structural
Woman are socialized with a set of desired behaviours expected from them.
Can you share a few reasons why more women should become leaders and managers?
Women and men are different, and this is good. People are different in their personalities and talents and hey bring different perspective and contributions.
Studies show that women in board rooms make a positive effect on company performance. The offer is to see women (and other minorities) rather as an asset and help to build structures to support them to provide contributions.
Can you please share “5 Things We Need To Increase Women’s Engagement in Leadership and Management?” If you can, please share an example or story for each.
First, targeted mentoring and coaching are essential. Women often face barriers to accessing high-quality mentorship, so structured programs help women identify their strengths, set clear goals, and navigate leadership challenges. I remember when my employer once said, “Try it for six months. If it doesn’t work, you can go back.” That kind of mentoring gave me a safe space to test my leadership skills without the fear of permanent failure, which really helped me move forward in my career.
Proactive networking is another important factor. Women need to actively create or join networks that connect them with senior leaders and like-minded peers. These networks provide access to important contacts and sponsorship opportunities.
Flexible working arrangements are also crucial. The challenge of balancing professional and family responsibilities often deters women from pursuing leadership roles. By adopting flexible hours, job-sharing, or part-time management positions, leadership roles can be made more accessible. In my own experience, I’ve seen the positive effects of companies offering more flexibility. In one example, a company revamped its policies to allow flexible scheduling, which allowed a talented leader to balance her childcare responsibilities with her role on the board. The result was improved team performance.
Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role.
Finally, objective recruitment and promotion processes are critical. Using methods like structured personality assessments and behaviour-based interviews helps combat unconscious bias and ensures candidates are chosen based on merit.
In your opinion, what systemic changes are needed to facilitate more equitable access for women to leadership roles?
Companies must embrace legislation that promotes gender diversity, like the EU’s push for more women on boards. However, quotas alone aren’t enough — accountability is key to preventing tokenism.
Corporate cultures need to evolve to value leadership traits that women excel in, such as empathy and collaboration. Changing outdated success metrics to reflect these qualities is essential, and recruitment and promotion processes must also be free from bias, prioritising merit over personal connections.
Work-life integration policies should be standard, not exceptions. Companies must normalise flexible work options for everyone, not just working mothers. Investing in female leadership development early on through mentorship, training, and networks like the WU Executive Academy’s Female Leaders Network ensures women have the resources to succeed in senior roles.
These systemic changes won’t happen overnight, but when companies and policymakers commit to action rather than discussion, real progress follows.
What strategies have you found most effective in mentoring and supporting other women to pursue leadership positions?
My main strategy is to empower young women to find their own ways and learn to trust in themselves. I am mentoring several women to help them in their academic careers. Very operationally I help them to understand their strengths and especially help them to understand they are not required to deliver 110% all the time. A trap that I have tapped in during my career and which I could not continue especially after I had my children.
A funny story to share was at one of my first panels I was invited to. I prepared so much and worked on my performance in every detail. I just wanted to be able to provide the perfect answers to all possible questions. Which is of cause not possible. However, I did not stop preparing and did not sleep the night before the event. So, when I was sitting at the panel, I was very tired, very serious and concentrated to get it all right. Without any smile, quite fact oriented. I was knowledgeable, said the right things, but my message was not convincing. It was just one boring smart voice among many others. Additionally, when others were speaking, I was so tiered that I simply fell asleep in front of 300 people. My sleep only took some seconds, and I still hope nobody saw it. However, that situation taught me an important lesson which I use to encourage women not to over prepare, take life a little easier, consider the package, how to deliver the message and not only what.
And yes we women cannot have everything at the same time. Children and major career steps at the same time is (almost) not possible to pursue at the same time. But there is also the right time for everything. Not everything needs to happen till the age of 35.
A good personal example is my recent career step, the appointment as Professor at University College London. When I was invited to apply, my youngest child was to finish School thus it was a window of opportunity that had opened, but it is then also a decision if you want to get you out of your comfort zone.
How would you advise a woman leader about how to navigate the challenges of being a woman in a leadership role within a male-dominated industry?
When I did my first formal education in Project Management, it was in 1996 and it was the Certificate Programme “International Project Management”, back then offered by the WU Vienna and the Technical University Vienna. There were 20 participants in class, 19 men and me. All of them having technical background mainly Engineering, Construction and Information Technology, the typical industries in which Project Management was applied back then. My background was Business Administration (specialized in Marketing) and I was the only woman. I was again an obvious alien, especially as I was the only woman in the room, and I was young. In this situation I asked myself whether I fit in? But reframed my question in what I can bring to the table, what are my competencies my talents that I can contribute and makes me add value. In this situation it was my social competencies, my strength to observe, listen and ask questions, thus my talent to lead processes in groups that added value and allowed me to add value. This is also my advice to women, know what you are good at understand what added value you can bring to the table. Be authentic and play to your strengths.
How do you balance the demand for authoritative leadership with the stereotypical expectations of female behaviour in professional settings?
Well use stereotypes like the hard man and the soft woman because that makes live easier to us. But the world is not black and white. If we look in more detail I do not believe in authoritarian leadership. Hero leadership is not working, especially not with younger generations. Hierarchies have become flatter, people want to work flexible, self organised, autonomy has become important, that is reflected in a modern leadership that is flatter, shared, distributed and often puts purpose in the foreground.
A leader needs be reflective person who takes decisions timely and is accountable for them. Core competences are to navigate uncertainty, embrace change, give orientation to others, think strategically and engaging others to co-create the future of an organisation. Today leaders should be able to stand in the spotlight but also is able to share the spotlight with others.

I woke up this morning at dawn…I wasn’t quite sure where I was until I opened the window. The sun was rising in the horizon and it clicked: “Vienna!”
I had always dreamed of Vienna as this elegant and majestuous city, home of Sisi the Empress and fairy tales my mum used to read me in bed. I remember the history books in high school with pictures of the Austro-Hungarian Empire portraying royal families and castles. The heart of Europe.
I left my hotel not knowing exactly where I was headed to; all I wanted was to travel back in time, wander through history, let the city surprise me and instinct be my guide.
As I approached the centre, the magic started to unfold: majestic buildings like the Parliament, the Museum…I walked through a manicured garden that led me straight into the statue of Mozart. It reminded me that Vienna is The City Of Music, home to Beethoven and Schubert and I can understand where they got the inspiration to…

Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a city steeped in history and culture, with a breathtaking array of stunning architecture, art, and museums. From the grand Baroque palaces to the intricately designed cathedrals, Vienna is a city that exudes elegance and sophistication. As you stroll through the streets of Vienna, you can’t help but be enchanted by the city’s rich history, its artistic vibrancy, and its charming atmosphere.
One of the must-see architectural wonders of Vienna is the St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic masterpiece that dominates the city’s skyline. With its towering spires and intricate stained glass windows, this cathedral is a testament to the city’s religious heritage and artistic prowess.
Another iconic landmark in Vienna is the Hofburg Palace, a grand and sprawling complex that served as the home of the Habsburg emperors for over six centuries. This Baroque palace is a magnificent example of Vienna’s architectural legacy, with its ornate facades, grand ballrooms, and opulent gardens.
Vienna is also home to a wide range of world-class museums, showcasing everything from classical art to modern design. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, for instance, is a treasure trove of paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts from across the globe, while the Belvedere Palace is home to an impressive collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
As you explore the streets of Vienna, you’ll discover a city that is steeped in history and culture, with an atmosphere that is at once lively and relaxed. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply looking to soak up the city’s unique charm, Vienna is sure to captivate your senses and leave you with memories that will last a lifetime.
Austria is renowned for its rich culinary traditions that draw inspiration from both its imperial past and its diverse cultural influences. From the classic Wiener Schnitzel to the sweet and indulgent Sachertorte, the city is a food lover’s paradise. The atmosphere and vibe of the Viennese food and drink scene is a delightful combination of tradition and innovation, showcasing the city’s culinary creativity and history.
Austrian cuisine is heavily influenced by its location in Central Europe, with hearty meat dishes and stews, such as Tafelspitz, a traditional beef dish, and Gulasch, a Hungarian-inspired beef and paprika stew, being popular staples. The Wiener Schnitzel is perhaps the most well-known Viennese dish, consisting of a thin, breaded and pan-fried veal cutlet served with a side of potato salad. The aroma of sizzling schnitzels and the sound of the crisp breading are unmistakable, and the dish is ubiquitous across the city’s traditional taverns and high-end restaurants alike.
But Austrian cuisine is not just about meat dishes. The country is also famous for its pastries and sweets, which are often enjoyed alongside a cup of coffee in one of the city’s many traditional coffeehouses. The Sachertorte, a rich chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam, is an iconic Viennese dessert that has been served in the city since the 19th century. Another classic is the Apfelstrudel, a pastry filled with apples, cinnamon and raisins, which is a perfect accompaniment to a hot cup of coffee on a chilly afternoon.
Vienna is also renowned for its coffee culture, with a long history of traditional coffeehouses that date back to the 18th century. These coffeehouses are more than just places to grab a caffeine fix, they are social and cultural hubs where locals come to relax, read the newspaper, and engage in conversation. The atmosphere is one of relaxed elegance, with plush chairs, marble tables, and waiters dressed in traditional attire. A visit to one of these coffeehouses is a quintessential Viennese experience, and a must-do for any traveler.
For those looking for something stronger, Austria is also famous for its wines and beers. The country’s wine regions are concentrated in the east, and produce some of the world’s finest white wines, such as Gruner Veltliner and Riesling. Austrian beer, on the other hand, is renowned for its crisp, refreshing taste, with brands such as Ottakringer and Schwechater being popular choices among locals.
Vienna is a city of contrasts, where grand palaces and museums coexist with gritty street art and alternative subcultures. While the city’s famous landmarks and tourist attractions are undoubtedly worth a visit, there are also many creative and less touristic neighborhoods that offer a glimpse into a different side of Vienna. These neighborhoods are full of character and charm, with a vibrant atmosphere and a unique vibe that is sure to leave a lasting impression on any traveler.

Another neighborhood worth exploring is Ottakring, located in the northwestern part of the city. Ottakring is a diverse and multicultural neighborhood, with a strong Turkish and Balkan influence. The area is known for its lively street markets and ethnic cuisine, with many family-owned restaurants serving up traditional dishes from around the world. Ottakring is also home to many artists and creatives, with a thriving street art scene and numerous galleries showcasing the latest contemporary art.
If you’re looking for a neighborhood that’s off the beaten path, then head to Favoriten. Located in the south of the city, Favoriten is a working-class neighborhood that has a vibrant and authentic feel. The area is a melting pot of cultures, with a strong immigrant community that has shaped its unique character. Here, you’ll find a diverse range of restaurants and cafes serving up traditional dishes from around the world, as well as colorful markets selling everything from fresh produce to exotic spices. The atmosphere in Favoriten is one of community and togetherness, with locals gathering in parks and public spaces to socialize and enjoy each other’s company.
Another neighborhood that’s worth exploring is Leopoldstadt, located on the eastern side of the Danube River. Leopoldstadt is a multicultural neighborhood that has a rich Jewish history, with many synagogues and Jewish institutions still present today. The area is known for its lively nightlife, with many bars, clubs, and music venues catering to a young and hip crowd. In Leopoldstadt, you’ll find a mix of traditional and modern, with historic buildings and cobblestone streets sitting alongside modern apartments and trendy cafes.
Finally, for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, the Vienna Woods offer a peaceful retreat just outside of Vienna. The woods are located to the west of the city, and are a popular destination for hikers and nature lovers. The area is home to many scenic trails, as well as historic castles and ruins that offer a glimpse into Vienna’s past.
Vienna has a rich and complex history, with cultural influences from all over Europe and beyond. The city’s impressive architecture and museums are a testament to this legacy, showcasing the many different styles and periods that have shaped Vienna’s cultural heritage.
The atmosphere in Vienna is one of refinement and sophistication, with a strong sense of history and tradition. The city’s grand palaces and elegant streets are a testament to its imperial past, with ornate facades and elaborate details that harken back to a bygone era.

The atmosphere at a classical music performance in Vienna is one of sophistication and elegance, with a strong emphasis on the arts and culture.
While Vienna is a city with a rich cultural heritage and plenty of sights to see, sometimes it can be nice to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and explore some of the recreational spaces outside of Vienna. These areas offer a chance to relax, recharge, and take in the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.
One popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts is the Vienna Woods, a range of hills and forests just outside of the city. The Vienna Woods offer a range of activities, including hiking, cycling, and horseback riding, as well as numerous picnic areas and lookout points that offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The atmosphere in the Vienna Woods is one of peace and tranquility, with a strong connection to nature.
For those interested in history and architecture, a visit to Schönbrunn Palace and its gardens is a must. The palace and its surrounding parklands are a UNESCO World Heritage site and offer a glimpse into the grandeur of imperial Vienna. The gardens are home to a variety of plant and animal species, as well as numerous fountains, statues, and other decorative elements. The atmosphere at Schönbrunn Palace is one of refinement and elegance, with a strong sense of history and tradition.
Another popular recreational area outside of Vienna is the Danube River, which flows through the heart of the city and beyond. The Danube offers a range of activities, from boat tours and river cruises to cycling and walking along its banks. The atmosphere along the Danube is one of relaxation and enjoyment, with a strong connection to the water and the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.
Finally, for those looking to combine outdoor recreation with cultural heritage, a visit to the Wachau Valley is a must. This picturesque region is known for its vineyards, historic towns, and stunning scenery, with numerous hiking and cycling trails that offer a chance to explore the area at your own pace. The atmosphere in the Wachau Valley is one of peace and tranquility, with a strong connection to the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the area.
Vienna is a city that is easily navigable, with a well-developed public transportation system that makes it easy to get around. One of the most efficient ways to explore Vienna is by using the U-Bahn, the city’s underground metro system, which covers a large portion of the city and provides quick and convenient access to many of Vienna’s top sights and attractions. The U-Bahn has a modern and efficient vibe, with clean and well-maintained stations and trains that run frequently throughout the day.
Another popular option for getting around Vienna is by bicycle. Vienna has an extensive network of bike paths and bike lanes that make it easy and safe to cycle through the city. Renting a bike is a great way to explore Vienna’s neighborhoods and get a closer look at the city’s architecture and historic landmarks. The atmosphere while cycling through Vienna is one of freedom and independence, with a strong sense of connection to the city and its surroundings.
For those who prefer a more leisurely pace, walking is also a great way to explore Vienna. The city is compact and easy to navigate on foot, with many of the top sights and attractions within walking distance of each other. Walking through Vienna allows you to take in the atmosphere of the city at a slower pace, with plenty of opportunities to stop and explore the many shops, cafes, and restaurants that line the streets.
Vienna is a city that can be enjoyed throughout the year, with each season offering a unique atmosphere and vibe. However, the best time to visit Vienna in terms of climate is during the spring and fall months. In the spring, the city comes to life as the weather warms up, with colorful blooms and lush greenery lining the streets and parks. In the fall, the cooler temperatures bring a crispness to the air, and the changing leaves paint the city in hues of red and gold. The atmosphere during these seasons is one of vibrancy and renewal, making it an ideal time to explore Vienna’s rich culture and history while enjoying comfortable weather conditions.

I am just back from a two-day workshop in Vienna. I am intellectually energized, as these small-scale workshops are the most productive academic sessions. It was an official meeting of the EASA Media Anthropology Network. It was great to catch up with some of the members I already knew and meet new academics. You can find the workshop program here. The event was supported by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, which is located in a historical building: the PSK Building. I presented on Local Knowledge and the Cultural Contexts of AI, which I am pursuing as part of my intellectual and research agenda nowadays.
I have visited Vienna several times, so I wasn’t into sightseeing. The weather was fantastic, and walking around the city was beautiful. Still, I could “unsave” in my Google Maps to places in my Atlas Obscura list! Josephinum (Old-school medical museum with more than 1,000 wax anatomical models created in the 18th century) and Pathological-anatomical collection in the Narrenturm (wikipedia entry) (Striking former mental hospital from the 1700s, now home to exhibitions on anatomy, illness & death.).
No photos allowed above, but you can see some here.

We arrived at the Residence to discover a spectacularly landscaped backyard:
We’re grateful for having arrived in time to enjoy it in all its blooming glory.
The dogs arrived unfazed and adapted quickly. They appreciated the opportunity to be outside in the gorgeous weather. Rosie assumed her sentinel stance…
…while Nero demonstrated his uncanny ability to get comfortable anywhere and on any surface, as long as it’s near us:
We had an opportunity to wander the commercial district on Währinger Straße near the Residence — an unforgettable first impression of the Vienna neighborhood:
And a grim reminder that the reverberations from Dallas are felt around the world:

Loving you was easy, letting go is tough!
You’ll never hear me say, “I wish I had never met you,” although sometimes I feel that way.
You’re my every thought — both the reason I cry and the reason I smile.
I never thought I’d be so hurt over something that didn’t last all that long.
The pressure on my heart when I think of how our relationship got worse and not better! But out of everyone who could have hurt me, why did it have to be you?

It is supposed to be the best restaurant in Vienna and the only Austrian entry (at No.15) on The List. Everyone we met in Vienna had only good things to say about the place, and we’d managed (I am still not sure how) to get a reservation at short notice. By the time Wednesday evening came, we’d had our fill of Weinerschnitzel and Tafelschpitz and 4 long days of conference food, and our anticipation over this meal had reached a fever pitch.
The Steirereck is located at the end of a long driveway leading into the heart of Stadtpark. It’s ensconsed in an elegant glass walled building that was glowing golden with incandescent light on a dismal wet Austrian evening of our dinner reservation. As I walked up the drive I was almost disappointed that we only managed a dinner reservation. I could imagine how incredibly impressive the high glass windows of the nouveau architectural building would have looked on a sunny Austrian afternoon.
When we sit down we are informed by the server that Austrian law requires that allergy information be printed on the menu alongside every dish. And so it is, in excruciating detail with a legend down by the bottom of the page listing every conceivable food item that you can be allergic to. A short while later, dish after dish of pre-starters pour out of the kitchen. As we start to go through them we realise a curious alignment with the legend at the bottom of the menu. Displaying a decidedly non-Austrian sense of humour, the restaurant has used the allergy information that they are required to include on the menu as the inspiration for each of the starters.
I’m not sure how it got to be like that but I get the distinct feeling that the chef draws a lot of his inspiration from bees and honey. And it starts with the char that is cooked (by the side of our table) in molten beeswax. I’ve seen a number of table-side preparations and been to my share of molecular magic side-shows but this was a truly impressive (unexpectedly so) performance. The char fillets are placed carefully in a nondescript wooden tray. They then pour molten beeswax into the tray till it completely covers the fish. Before our eyes the fillets begin to change colour from their normal translucent state to the opaque white that we are accustomed to seeing.
They give it about 15 minutes and then gently ease the fish out of the beeswax that has now hardened solid. The fish pops out whole and perfectly cooked. They take it away to do some magic in the kitchen and it comes to the table beautifully plated with a long carrot and some sour cream.
They aren’t stingy with their vegetables at Stierereck and for someone who really likes his meat that can sometimes come in the way. Hidden somewhere under the many layers of coloured bell peppers and melon was some Venus clam and I was darned if I could find it. That apart the dish tasted exquisite with many layers of flavour and texture from the mild sweetness of the peppers and melon, to the mouthfeel of Jerusalem artichokes all tied in with the oily overtones of macadamia and black olives.
They followed this up with a mini garden of herbs, porcini mushrooms, green verbena leaves and nuts that I have to admit was not overwhelming, delicate presentation notwithstanding. It’s a dish I thought they would have done well to leave out of the tasting menu and serve only to the vegetarians (but maybe that is my prejudice showing).
The meal is accompanied by little cards that they stick in a sort of a stand by your plate. It contains a description of the dish you are currently eating – with far more detail than one would get from a traditional restaurant menu. They are also convenient pocket-sized keepsakes of the meal and saved me from requesting a copy of the menu as I always do.
It’s from these little cards that I realised that the Job’s Tears that were referred to in the description of the next course on the menu was more than just a Biblical reference but an actual plant (Coix lacrimal-jobi) that is eaten as a vegetable in China and the Far East. In this dish the Job’s Tears had been crisped up and served in a tiny conical wrap that preserved its crunchy texture. I am a fan of carp so I had no complaints with the fish or in fact the entire dish, which had a distinctly Eastern sensibility – thanks in large part, I am sure, to the flavours of Pandan Oil that tied the entire thing together.
I can’t say I was terribly enthused by the Lamb. It was a good hunk of meat, well cooked, if not particularly well seasoned. I can’t fault the technique except that at a restaurant with these credentials I’d have expected a more tasty serving. I thought the popcorn was a treat – it carried the flavour of coffee (which was interesting) and the vegetables were tasty and crunchy – I particularly liked the grilled baby corn. I learned that the sauce was made from the Scarlet Monarde grown in the Steirereck gardens and that imparted the familiar flavours of bergamot to the dish.
The meat course of the day had to be the Venison. I’m a huge fan of well cooked venison – I like the tender, pliable and succulent texture of the meat as well as characteristic slightly games (in a good way) flavour of the meat. They serve the venison with perfectly cooked half moons of squash, baby artichoke hearts sliced flat and a sauce of orange blossom. All in all an excellent pairing of textures and tastes. Clearly the dish of the day for me.
I can’t say any of the desserts really knocked it out of the park. They were all fruity and seasonal — summery even which was a bit of a contrast to the wet weather outside. But none of them rose to the level of brilliance that I have seen at the best restaurants in the world.
Of the desserts on the table, the prize for prettiness clearly went to the Crepe which was served in a roll of delicate strips of crisp and crunchy batter. Alongside the shredded crepe was a colourful row of violet flowers and a delicious puree of medlar.
I started out by remarking on the subliminal presence of bees and honey that hovers in the background of the meal. As I should have expected, the finale to the meal was a selection from the impressive selection of artisanal honeys available at Steirereck.
They rolled out a trolley that contained racks and racks of different varieties of honey, including a healthy selection of honeycombs. They made a show of opening a small porthole at the side — whereupon we heard a furious buzzing. It took us a moment — a very nervous moment — to realise that this was just a recording and that we were not about to be swarmed by angry bees. The server was knowledgeable — or at least he seemed to be given that I have next to no apiary knowledge to be able to question his claims — and we all selected a few varieties to taste.
But taste was all we could manage. Much as I love raw honey, at the end of a sumptuous meal a few licks of the back of a spoon was all I could manage. What we did taste was, surprisingly, subtly different — the local floral conditions clearly make a difference to the end product. I wish we could have carried a few bottles home.
There is no doubt that Chef Heinz Reitbauer is a master of his ingredients. He has two Michellin Stars, four Toques and a place in The List. The location of the restaurant, inside the large and verdant Stadtpark is unmatched and from pictures on the Internet, I would imagine it would have been even more spectacular on a sunny Austrian summer afternoon.
And it is a good restaurant. Some of the dishes (the molten beeswax char in particular) were imaginative and unique. The use of locally produced ingredients and the quaint connection with honeybees is charming. Not having eaten extensively in the region, I cannot really comment with authority but I will not be putting up any arguments if someone claims it is the best restaurant in Austria.
But is it deserving of its place on the list (which, I should remind you, is down from its highest rank at No. 9 in 2013)? I am not convinced. I have eaten at places far lower down the list that have turned out food that is equally exquisite but done so consistently, course upon course without a hitch.
No. 15? Maybe not.

An Austrian Wildlife Icon
These cute animals are European Ground Squirrels, which I saw whilst on holiday in Vienna.
I hadn’t even heard of them until quite recently. Over the last few years, the British media have been publishing more and more photos of ground squirrels and other wildlife in Vienna. Eventually, I couldn’t resist heading over to Austria to see what was going on for myself.
There are plenty of public parks in Vienna, but, as far as I know, only a couple of them have ground squirrels. All of my photos were taken at the Blumengärten Hirschstetten, which you can get to quite easily by tram.
Visit in spring or summer, and you should have a great chance of seeing the squirrels. I spotted several within minutes of arriving, and one of them ran right up to my feet as if it was welcoming me to the park.
I assume the squirrels are used to people feeding them, although there are signs asking you not to.

Since I am currently in Munich but usually live in Vienna, I would like to highlight the differences between Viennese and Munich residents. At first glance, one might not believe that Munich residents differ so much from Viennese, but a comparison reveals significant differences. Let’s first compare the cities to illustrate the differences.
The most noticeable difference is that Vienna is the capital of Austria, while Munich is “only” a large city in Germany. Munich is slightly smaller than Vienna and has fewer inhabitants. Although Munich has only three-quarters of Vienna’s population, it is three times as wealthy, which is evident in the people.
Usually, the population is divided into three classes: lower, middle, and upper class. In Munich, however, there seems to be no clear middle class, and the upper class appears very snobbish. This does not mean that there is no middle class, but rather that it is less noticeable. You see either people who look wealthy or those who appear poorer. The middle class behaves more subtly and hides in public: they either dress elegantly to appear upper class or wear normal clothes, making them seem poorer. I correct my previous statement and say that the middle class behaves discreetly. Now let’s look at the people in Vienna.
Vienna is divided into districts, but there are only a few districts that clearly represent a social class. Even in the wealthy districts, there are hardly any snobs or visibly rich people. In Vienna, the middle class predominates. Everyone looks as if they earn roughly the same. There are exceptions here as well, just like in Munich.
Although I have strongly criticized Munich here, it is a beautiful city. Of course, there are also unfriendly people in Munich, but I have not encountered any so far. In conclusion, both Munich and Vienna are worth visiting.

The Viennese street names not only serve as orientation in the street network, but they also tell stories and describe the character of the city.
The narrow Hafnersteig leads to the center of the “Fleischmarkt”. It was mentioned for the first time in 1220. Therefore, it’s the oldest meat market in Vienna.
In the basement of the house, that dates from the 17th century, is housed a well-known tavern, the “Yellow Eagle”, later known as “The Golden Eagle.
Learn a little patience. You never know what might be around the corner. Still, around it, there may wait, a new road or a secret gate.
The bakery in “Schönlaternegasse” was well known for its good bread. According to the legend, the basilisk was found in the well of a bakery by a young maid.
The Basilisk a mythological lizard type beast that was supposedly a cross-breeding of a cock, a toad, and a snake.
Georg, one of the baker’s helpers, who was secretly in love with the maid, volunteered to undertake this task to gain the Master’s approval of their marriage plan.
Down in the well, the basilisk looked into the mirror and when he saw how ugly he really was, burst up.
The well was filled in with stones, and our hero Georg married the young maid.
The blocks of houses in the so-called “Blutgassen” quarter in the first district, between Singerstraße, Blutgasse, Grünangergasse, and Domgasse, are among the oldest in Vienna.
Their foundations date back to the 12th century. The buildings erected on them date from the 16th and 17th centuries.
To which circumstance the blood alley (Blutgasse) owes its name has not yet been established. According to the legend, in Medieval times (1312) the Templars (monks) were brutally slaughtered in their courtyard (Fähnrichhof) and the blood ran down the little lane like a stream.
Nearby the St. Stephen’s Cathedral is the small street named Domgasse.
At the address “Domgasse 5” you can visit the only one existing Mozart’s apartments in Vienna. From 1784 to 1787, the composer lived in this Haus with his wife Constanza. During this period, Mozart wrote many works including his opera “The Marriage of Figaro”.
The first documented mention of a house on this property dates back to the 14th century. Since 1458 the bakers have settled in this area. According to the reports, this place is the birthplace of the famous Viennese croissants (Kipferl).
It is very unlikely, however, that this shape did not appear first at 1683 (allegedly to mock the Turks by the chosen shape of a crescent), as we already know that from the 13th century the bakers gave “chipfen” to dignitaries as a Christmas present.
Above the portal, there is a house sign with old pastry molds, which reminds us of the tradition.
From left to right and from top to bottom the following pastries are visible: Bosniakerl, Schusterlaberl, Kipfel, Brezel, Beugel and, a Girafferl.
The southern tower of St. Stephen’s Cathedral (136.7 m) is, without doubt, the main landmark of the city of Vienna.
Tradition speaks for Rudolf IV as the founder of the tower, the duke himself has laid the foundation stone in 1368. Its construction lasted 65 years, from 1368 to 1433.
At that time the south tower was the highest tower Europa’s, meanwhile, it’s between the top ten church buildings. The tallest church is in Ulm, Germany (161,5 m.)
During the Austria — Hungary monarchy no building was allowed to be built higher than St. Stephen’s Cathedral.

It’s hard to believe that I’ve now been in Vienna for over a year. I’ve seen so much, but there is so much more of the city to explore.
Often I spend Saturdays walking around trying to see something new. Yesterday was exactly that.
I discovered there is an English-language bookstore here so I headed there first. I do speak and read German fluently, but I prefer English books (also to keep my English going, since I mainly live and work in German here).
The shop is appropriately called Shakespeare & Company, located in the center of Vienna at Sterngasse 2 not too far from the Danube canal. It is stuffed full of all kinds of books both fiction and non-fiction. It was a fun place to browse!
Then I wandered around that area, which I hadn’t really seen in detail so far, heading toward a meeting with a friend. The café we wanted to go to was sadly closed, so we headed across the canal to the 2nd district and a lovely café/bistro called Goldener Papagei (Golden Parrot) at Praterstrasse 17. We sat outside, though it was a very windy day. There are many tables under some lovely trees: a perfect spot for a chat and a drink.
The perfect day came to a close meeting an American friend from Germany for dinner at one of my favorite Israeli restaurants, Makom, at Schottenfeldgasse 18 in the 7th district.

You know that feeling when a song hits you right in the gut? Like, it wasn’t just made for you, but like it somehow knew what you needed to hear before you even did? That’s what “Vienna” by Billy Joel did to me.
I came across that song again during my drive home, on a random night just a few weeks ago, when I was overanalyzing my life, my future, and whether I’m already too late to do something meaningful. The classic mid-to-late 20s spiral, you know? One minute I’m driving slowly through the city, the next I’m questioning my entire existence.
Then, boom; “Vienna waits for you”.
I don’t know what it is about that line, but it unlocked something in me. I’ve never thought about, let alone visited Vienna. Maybe it’s the gentle piano intro. Maybe it’s the way Billy sings it like a wise old friend sitting next to me at 3AM, telling me to breathe.
“Slow down, you crazy child. You’re so ambitious for a juvenile.”
I felt exposed. How dare he come for my entire personality like that? But also, he’s right. I am ambitious. I’ve always wanted to get things done fast, prove myself, complete all the milestones before I hit my imaginary deadline. And lately, that mindset has been eating at me. I kept thinking, “Why don’t I have everything figured out yet?”
But Vienna reminds me that I don’t have to. I’m still young. A 26 year-old is basically a 6 year-old in the “adult” life. And “youth” doesn’t mean I have to hustle 24/7. It means I have time to figure things out. It means I can still dream big without burning out trying to make it happen as fast as possible.
There’s something deeply comforting about being told that it’s okay to not be in a rush. We don’t get that a lot. Being told that success doesn’t expire at 30. That if I haven’t landed my dream job, or released that album, or written that book yet, it doesn’t mean I have failed. It just means I’m still on my way.
And that’s more than okay.
“Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.”
That line gets me every time. Because that fire, yes. I have felt it. I still feel it. The desire to do something great, to not waste time. But sometimes, that fire turns into anxiety. Into comparison. Into restlessness. And this song basically told me, “Hey, chill. You have time. You’re doing fine.”
Lately, every time I get overwhelmed about the future or about the feeling like I’m not doing enough, I put this song on. And for those three and a half minutes, I always feel like the noise quiets down. I remember that life isn’t a race. That I don’t have to catch up to anyone. That I’m allowed to take detours, to pause, to just… be.
And beyond all that, the song just feels beautiful. The melody is gentle, a little wistful, but hopeful. It’s not sad. It’s patient. Like Vienna itself, whatever it symbolizes, it can wait. It’s not going anywhere. And neither is my worth.
I think the main thing that Vienna taught me is: I’m not late. I’m not behind. I’m exactly where I need to be. And sometimes, slowing things down is the most powerful thing I can do.
Because Vienna waits for me.
And that’s more than enough.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train.
We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars (they didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing).
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: Tell me about your dad.
Me: Jeez, I don’t really like talking about him.
Caroline: I can tell. But still… Try.
Me: Ok, tell me when to stop. He was a real piece of shit. Aside from being a 500 lbs. shut-in, he was a manipulative, habitual liar. Everything he did, he did in the name of self-interest. He smelled like literal shit and piss, and only got dressed a few times a year, usually for doctor appointments. His legs were so big, they were ripping open. He’d secretly order food then bury the remains deep in the trash. He was addicted to pornography (I found out after he died, when I was looking through his computer). When my girlfriend called the house, he’d listen in then deny it. I could always hear him breathing because he’d forget to press mute.
I have zero happy memories of him and prayed for his death for almost 10 years. He used to stay up all night, whaling and crying in the basement (where he lived), prompting me to cover all the vents with pillows. One time a friend heard him from outside and asked me if there was a dying animal in the house. There was, but I couldn’t admit it. During his final moments, when he pled to me for forgiveness, I did not absolve him or try to make him feel any better. I told him to be quiet, that his time had passed. When he died, I didn’t cry or feel sad, only relieved. His memory haunt me forever.
Caroline: Ok. That was a lot.
Me: I know.
Caroline: Is that why you use drugs?
Me: Hmm, I guess?
At the time I didn’t realize the direct connection between my mourning process and my drug use. I was still in the denial phase, and not in the sense of I couldn’t believe he died, rather, I was denying my own feelings. I’d done so much mourning while he was still alive that I’d assumed that part was done with. It was not. Drugs helped me cope with that, without me even realizing. Adderall kept me focused and productive, weed prevented me from being angry all the time, and alcohol allowed me not to care about life in general. Because of my regimented nature, I needed them all, every day, in the same amount, at the same times. Being a drug addict, more than anything, made life tolerable. I could focus on one thing: getting high, and not worry about all my sadness and pent-up anger.
We arrived in Vienna with no plans, and nowhere to stay, so we walked around the city center looking for a hostel. When we got tired of carrying our bags, we stopped in a bar to rest and ask for directions. Before Google and Yelp, it was bartenders who could tell you about every business within a 5-mile radius. “Don’t go to that one. Go to this one. Ask for Ron. Tell him I sent you.” There’s very little of that anymore.
The music disturbed me as soon as we walked in.
Me: What is this hot garbage they’re playing.
Caroline: It sounds like David Hasselhoff.
Me: You’re not going to believe this, but, in America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch. Isn’t that crazy?
Caroline: Are you being serious right now?
Me: Yeah, the same exact name.
Caroline: IT’S THE SAME PERSON.
Me: Wait… So, he’s a musician too?
Caroline: He’s the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He’s put out more than 20 albums.
Me: Are you sure there aren’t two of them?
Caroline: Also, we have Baywatch in Australia. I don’t live on the moon.
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. Regardless, his music was terrible, like a cheesier version of Depeche Mode. When I walked over to the Jukebox to put an end to it, I was shocked to find that all the albums were Hasselhoff. It was a fucking Hasselhoff bar. I felt like I was on a bad acid trip. We had one drink, as to not be rude, and while doing so met a few fellow backpackers. They were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner, and offered to take us there. To our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point. It had a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and my Adderall supply was dwindling. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of energy too.
That night we shared a couple bottles of wine (that was considered “not drinking” for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border), along with some ultra-thin paper to match, and I wanted to put them to use. (I love thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in your hand. My favorite type of paper when I was a kid was tracing paper. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers would tell me I couldn’t. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular lined paper and crumple it before writing on it. It made it softer. I don’t know why that mattered to me so much, but I bet it’s the same reason I don’t like museums.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far. Pat was, and still is, my best friend. He was the one I confided in after my dad died, and the first person I told the whole messy story to. He helped me mourn and continues to. I don’t know where I’d be without him.
Here’s an excerpt:
…You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It wasn’t that bad (it was). I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She has a great ass, in addition to being an awesome person. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
I told her about you, and she said to send her regards. We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though. Speaking of which, tell your mom I say hi. I hope your weird, home-schooled, born-again Christian girlfriend is magically becoming less lame, but I doubt it…
There were only a few beds available when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. After giving her a kiss, I said goodnight and went my own way. Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. If I’d had multiple outfits, I would have laid one out in anticipation.
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught her the rules of chess. She’d never played before, and though I wasn’t that good, I enjoyed teaching people how to play. Kevin taught me how to play. He’s beat me every single time then say something nice like “wow you’re so good now.” It only pissed me off more, though he meant it.
We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be. I could tell how much Caroline enjoyed feeling me press up against her. At one point she reached behind me to pull me closer, and I got an erection.
Me: I never thought I’d get a boner while playing chess.
Caroline: What is wrong with you?
Me: It’s a natural reaction to friction.
Caroline: Jesus, that’s not what I meant. Why do you say these things out loud?
Me: Isn’t that just part of my charm?
Caroline: I guess so, Mr. McEnroe. I guess so.
We went to a museum that afternoon but for the life of me I cannot remember which one, or what was inside. It could have been dinosaur bones or art; I have no clue. Museums are all the same to me, just a bunch of shit you can’t touch.
A Mitch Hedberg joke comes to mind…
“I was at a craft fair and there was a jar of Jellybeans. The guy said, ‘Guess how many Jellybeans are in the jar, and win a prize’. Aw, come on man, let me just have some.”
I mean, I want to party, not look at a party.
I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards bought a sausage with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few families laughed and pointed. When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about weed, I would have gotten high earlier.
While wondering around, we passed a skateboard shop that was loudly playing Raekwon’s, “Verbal Intercourse,” perhaps my favorite Wu-adjacent song. It pulled me in like a magnet. The Asian dude behind the counter gave us a welcoming look as soon as we walked in.
Me: Yo, I love this song.
Guy: Me too. He’s going to be at The Melkveg in Amsterdam next week. You going?
Me: I didn’t know about it, but I am now.
Guy: I’m going too. Maybe I’ll see you there.
Me: Hell yeah.
Guy: Do you need weed?
Drugs always find me.
Me: I do. Do you sell it?
He reached under the counter and pulled out a backpack filled with nearly a pound of weed.
Guy: I do.
He broke out a scaled and weighed 4 grams.
Guy: Will this get you to Amsterdam?
Me: You’d better double it.
Guy: Ha, ok. I feel you.
After making the exchange, we chatted for a few minutes. He asked me where I was from, and when I told him I’d just come from Brooklyn, he couldn’t believe how close I lived to the Wu-Tang Clan.
Guy: Have you ever been to Staten Island?
Me: No one not from Staten Island has ever been to Staten Island.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She’d made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?
When we got there around 8pm we were the only ones in the place. The entire bar was empty, the tables and booths too. The bartender welcomed us like he’d been waiting for company and waved us over to the bar. He looked visibly disappointed when we beelined for a booth. Neither of us were in the mood for small talk, so each time we needed drinks, I walked up to the bar to order. It became increasingly awkward with each trip, so I started ordering in bunches, which seemed to only bother him more. We were taking shots of Caroline’s favorite drink, Sambuca, my least favorite. “You have to drink it,” she told me, “It’s named after you.”
We got really drunk really fast, and after a few rounds we were making out at the table. The bartender gave us nasty “get a room” looks, but we ignored him. Then I devised a plan, one that has been devised many a time before, but never by me.
Me: Meet me in the bathroom.
I said it with confidence. It didn’t require a response. It was a command.
When she burst in, I pulled her pants down and put her in the sink, something I hadn’t premeditated. I was in a flow state.
I don’t care to divulge all the details of the experience, but I will say that there was no penetration. We got each other off, but didn’t cross that line. It was an unspoken agreement we had. Plus, I didn’t have a condom, and I was militant about using them. I’d go limp if I didn’t have one on. I know, weird.
After getting ourselves together, we exited the bathroom, where we were greeted by the bartender, who was holding our bill, visibly furious. I paid it, standing in front of the bathroom door, and we ran out, laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, at least in my experience. Caroline was laughing. She had no shame. I took her back and we chugged water in the waiting room.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean tonight?
Caroline: No, I mean “us”. Like, tonight we go to bed, and never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: What if we end up in the same place again?
Caroline: Then we can pick up right where we left off.
Me: Should we exchange emails?
Caroline: No.
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Exactly.
Me: (Kissing her cheek) Ok, goodbye Caroline.
Caroline: Goodbye Johnny Mac.
At the time I wasn’t sure if she was trying to get rid of me, or what her motivations were. Now I realize it had to do with timing (timing is everything). She knew when to get offstage. It was me that wanted an encore. Man, she was cool.

The Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons, dubbed “Humanity at the Crossroads,” addressed the urgent need to regulate deadly autonomous weapons systems. As a youth delegate, I gained valuable insights into this critical issue. Here’s a snapshot of what I learned:
Understanding the Big Picture
The conference shed light on the serious challenges posed by autonomous weapons. They could make conflicts worse, harm civilians, and disrupt efforts to keep peace worldwide.
Why Human Control Matters
A key lesson was the importance of humans staying in charge of decisions about using force. Letting machines make life-or-death choices raises big moral and legal questions. We need clear rules to make sure people are responsible and to stop these weapons from causing harm.
Talking Ethics
We spent time discussing what’s right and wrong when it comes to autonomous weapons. We talked about how to respect people’s dignity and protect them from these weapons’ dangers. We also thought about how using these weapons might change society in the long run and change our relationship with technology.
Challenges We Face
Even though many people agree on the need for rules, there are still big challenges ahead. Some powerful governments and tech companies control a lot of the conversation. It’s tough for other voices, like from everyday people and community groups, to be heard.
Youth Power
Young people like us played a big part in the conference. Our fresh ideas and energy showed how important it is to get everyone involved in the discussion to address autonomous weapons. We left feeling inspired and ready to push for change in our communities.
What Comes Next
The conference wasn’t just talk, it was a call to action. We agreed to work even harder to establish strong global rules for autonomous weapons. But it won’t happen overnight. We need to keep up the pressure and work together to make real change.
In sum, the Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons was a chance to learn, share ideas, and get ready for action. We learned how crucial it is to keep humans in control of decisions about life and death in warfare. As we move forward, let’s stay focused on making the world safer and fairer for everyone.

In praise of 15 minute cities: Why a ‘city of short distances’ feels better.
“People realised the state of their neighbourhoods could change. They could enjoy life in front of their front doors without owning a garden, without having a balcony,” said Vienna’s former Deputy Mayor, Maria Vassilakou.
Rated no.1 in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Global Liveability Index, Vienna frequently places as one of the world’s top cities to live in. And while it’s never explicitly called a 15- or 20-minute city, it nevertheless responds to the social, technological and ecological challenges that we all face.
Described as “the city of short distances”, urban planning policy in the city has long put pedestrians first (since the 80s, in fact). And, a few decades down the line, the results are evident everywhere: pavement expansions, improvements to public transport connectivity, sports provision and — notably — the longest continuous pedestrianised space in Europe, in the form of shopping street Mariahilferstraße.
Vienna feels equitable and inclusive, too. It’s affordable, for starters. And a focus on gender mainstreaming, a strategy adopted to achieve gender equality in society, has translated to things like fully illuminated footpaths, more entrances and exits to parks, grants for neighbourhood open space, and additional premiums for research conducted by women — a real-world commitment to urban planning that’s led by the needs and safety of citizens.
LIVEABILITY SCORE: 8/10. A compact and connected city geared towards pedestrians, safety and people-first infrastructure.

I’ve now been living in Vienna about a year and a half (my how time flies!).
I’ve seen so much so far but there are a couple of places I didn’t get to until today.
We’ve had very cold weather the past week or so, down to close to freezing temps at night, and so walking around or exploring isn’t exactly what one wants to do.
Today is a glorious sunny (and finally warm) day so I headed to the center to take in two beautiful and interesting historical places.
Kaiserliche Schatzkammer
First I went to the Imperial Treasury (Kaiserliche Schatzkammer) which is part of the large Hofburg palace complex the emperors of Austria lived in.
I highly recommend purchasing tickets online before you go. While today’s line wasn’t too long, in spite of the plethora of tourists in town, you can just walk right in and get your online ticket scanned to enter without having to wait for than a few seconds.
You enter a few darkened rooms which contain all kinds of imperial and church artifacts, such as crowns, robes, orbs and the like. It’s not that big but you do learn a lot about Austrian history throughout the ages and also the growth and collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian empire over the centuries.

Vienna is such a historic city known everywhere around the world for its art and culture. Here is an article that will help you to enjoy your trip in the capital of Austria.
Also, remember that I’m writing on Medium and that growing a huge community over there is very important for me. The name of my channel is “Clément Delabruyère” so please follow my channel : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a fascinating city that blends history with modernism. Covering an area of around 414 km², it is home to almost 1.9 million inhabitants. With its cobbled streets, Baroque palaces and prestigious museums, Vienna is a true cultural and architectural gem.
The city is divided into 23 districts, each offering its own unique charm and ambience. Vienna plays a major geopolitical role as the headquarters of numerous international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
Classical music has a special place in Vienna’s history, having witnessed the birth of legendary composers such as Mozart, Beethoven and Strauss. Viennese waltzes and famous operas still thrill the city. Vienna is also renowned for its culinary tradition, with historic cafés offering delicious pastries such as sachertorte.
The Schönbrunn Palace, a former imperial residence, and St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic icon, are among the iconic sites to visit. Well-tended gardens and abundant green spaces, notably Prater Park, add to Viennese quality of life.
Vienna stands out for its concern for sustainability and quality of life, regularly topping world rankings in this area. Its efficient public transport system and green initiatives are testimony to this commitment.
In short, Vienna embodies an enchanting blend of historical heritage, artistic creativity and contemporary progress, making it a city that captivates the hearts and minds of those who discover it.
Vienna’s history dates back to antiquity, when the Romans established a military camp on the banks of the Danube around the 1st century AD. This camp, called Vindobona, was the starting point for the city’s development. Over the centuries, Vindobona flourished as a point of convergence for trade routes and cultures, benefiting from its strategic position at the crossroads of Central Europe.
In the Middle Ages, Vienna became an important political and cultural center under the Babenbergs, then the Habsburgs from the 13th century onwards. In 1440, Emperor Frederick III established the imperial residence in Vienna, laying the foundations for a long period of imperial grandeur.
The 16th century saw Vienna confronted with the challenges posed by the Ottoman wars, with the sieges of Vienna in 1529 and 1683. These sieges were crucial moments in the city’s history, marking unsuccessful Ottoman attempts to conquer Central Europe.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Vienna became the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a major power in Europe. During this period, the city became a center of classical music and art, home to such geniuses as Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Baroque architecture flourished, giving rise to iconic buildings such as Schönbrunn Palace.
The 20th century was marked by upheaval, including two world wars and the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. After the Second World War, Vienna was divided into four zones of occupation, reflecting the Cold War period.
After the end of the occupation in 1955, Vienna regained its status as Austrian capital and diplomatic center. It hosted international organizations such as the UN and OPEC, consolidating its position in world affairs.
Today, Vienna continues to shine as a cosmopolitan city, blending its historic heritage with a dynamic modernity. The city has preserved its rich past while looking to the future, making it one of Europe’s leading cultural and intellectual destinations.
This imperial palace and its magnificent gardens are a symbol of the opulence of the Austrian Empire. Don’t miss a tour of the palace’s sumptuous rooms and a stroll through the well-kept gardens.
This iconic Gothic cathedral dominates downtown Vienna. Its elaborate architecture and impressive spire make it a must-see.
This Baroque complex comprises two palaces and superb gardens. It houses a remarkable collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt, notably “The Kiss”.
World-renowned for its superb acoustics and artistic performances, the opera house is an iconic venue for classical music lovers.
A former imperial palace, the Hofburg today houses several museums and institutions, including the Austrian National Library and the Sissi Museum.
This museum houses an exceptional collection of graphic art, including drawings, engravings and prints by masters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Dürer.
These two museums are located side by side and offer impressive collections of art and natural history.
This city park is home to the famous Wiener Riesenrad, Vienna’s iconic Ferris wheel, as well as numerous attractions, restaurants and green spaces.
These venues represent just a fraction of what Vienna has to offer in terms of culture, history and entertainment. The city is full of treasures to explore, and each corner offers a unique and enriching experience for visitors.
An Austrian composer prodigy, Mozart is one of the most influential figures in classical music. He composed over 600 works, including operas, symphonies and concertos, making a profound impact on the European musical landscape.
The father of psychoanalysis, Freud revolutionized our understanding of human psychology. His theories on the unconscious, the Oedipus complex and the role of dreams left a lasting imprint on the human sciences.
German composer and pianist, although born in Bonn, Beethoven spent much of his life in Vienna. He is famous for his transition from Classicism to Romanticism, with emblematic works such as his 9th Symphony.
Austrian Symbolist painter and leading figure of the Vienna Secession, Klimt is known for his ornate portraits and bold works, including “The Kiss”. He helped shape Art Nouveau and Modernism.
An Austrian Expressionist artist, Schiele was renowned for his provocative portraits and bold artistic vision. His unique style left a lasting imprint on 20th-century art, despite his untimely death at the age of 28.
These five figures left a significant mark on the history of art, music, psychology and culture in Vienna and around the world.
In order to conclude, if you have any ideas for improving this type of article (adding a section, for example), please let me know in the comments. Also, if there’s a place in the world that you particularly like and would like me to write another article about, I invite you to submit your ideas too.

Until I arrived at the airport, I could believe this was indeed happening and that it was not a dream anymore. It has been three years since my last travelling on holiday, and since then, I have been longing for the day that I could travel again.
On the flight to my destination, I imagined what would happen on this holiday and recalled my last memory on a flight. Who could imagine the world would have a massive change in such a short period?
After a two-and-a-half-hour flight from the UK, I arrived at my destination, Vienna. I have always wanted to visit Vienna. As the capital city of Austria, voted as one of the safest cities in Europe, which is best for solo travelling, like what I am doing.
“You must visit Schoenbrunn Palace. It is one of the most impressive landmarks in Vienna,” said my father. Before going on the trip, many people told me the same thing.
After 20 minute ride on the metro, I arrived at Schoenbrunn station. Once leaving the station…

The first time I heard Vienna by Billy Joel, I was on a train home after college, the world outside dipped in the amber light of a tired evening. I had just bombed an interview I had poured my soul into. My head was a whirlwind of spiralling doubts — about my future, about whether I had what it takes, about everything. And then Vienna arrived — not like a pop anthem or an uplifting chorus, but like a friend who sits with you in silence and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
“Slow down, you crazy child
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you’re so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid?”
In that moment, tears welled up — not because of the failure, but because of how deeply the song understood the ache behind it. How it met me in the in-between, where so many of us live: driven but unsure, hopeful but exhausted.
That lyric wasn’t just about me. It was about a generation raised to hustle, to quantify their worth through grades, internships, side projects, and glowing LinkedIn posts. I had come to think of life as a ladder. But Vienna whispered of a different metaphor — a garden, perhaps. Something that grows in time, with pauses, with pruning, with seasons of bloom and rest.
It reminded me of The Midnight Library by Matt Haig — a book about a woman who, burdened by regret, stumbles upon a mystical library containing infinite versions of her life. Each book in the library reveals a different path she could have taken. The novel forces you to ask: what if the life you’re racing toward isn’t the one that would’ve made you happy? What if the pauses, the missed exits, the so-called failures, are the very fabric of the life meant for you?
“When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?”
In Joel’s metaphor, Vienna isn’t a destination you rush to. It’s the life that waits — patiently, quietly — for you to stop sprinting long enough to hear its music. It’s the version of you that grows not by doing more, but by understanding what enough feels like. That revelation mirrored the essence of The Midnight Library: the idea that you’re not a failure just because you’re not on someone else’s timeline.
The truth is, I didn’t need a new plan that day on the train. I needed perspective. I needed someone — or something — to tell me that I hadn’t missed my moment, that there are many doors yet to open. And Vienna, in its tender, piano-laced wisdom, did exactly that.
“You can get what you want or you can just get old
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through”
Those words haunted me. Because I had never thought of burnout as a kind of death. But that’s what it is: the death of wonder, of joy, of being here. I was chasing a life so hard that I was forgetting to live the one already unfolding around me.
Billy Joel’s Vienna didn’t just soften my ambition — it redefined it. It told me that ambition rooted in fear is a form of imprisonment. But ambition rooted in patience? In stillness? That’s purpose. That’s wisdom.
So now, when I feel that panic — that rising tide of “not enough,” of “too late,” of “what am I doing with my life?” — I don’t drown. I return to the song. To Joel’s voice, gently guiding me back.
“Slow down, you’re doing fine.”
And just like the woman in The Midnight Library learns: the life you’re meant to live isn’t the one with the loudest applause. It’s the one where you’re fully alive. The one that waits for you — just like Vienna.

Disclaimer : This is a long post and will require more attention span than scrolling through reels. :) So read at your own convenience
I have been extremely fortunate to travel to a lot of places in my lifetime. From the majestic temples in South India to the gigantic mountains in the north-east of India, I have pretty much covered it all. However, I recently traveled for work to Europe and it was by far one of the most memorable trips ever. Every journey brings forth some old lessons and new learnings. It reunites you with old friends and introduces you to strangers only to appreciate that life is nothing but the precious moments shared with friends, family, and other beautiful people.
I happened to visit Amsterdam, Rust(Germany), Basel, Paris, and Vienna, and each city had its own story that had to be unfolded. It was an 18-day trip, and I will be sharing my experiences in multiple articles. This article will solely be dedicated to my exploration of Vienna, and later ones will cover other cities.
I visited Vienna as the last leg of my journey after finishing all my work commitments. Vienna was not going to be on my list, but like any Indian Parent, my parents did not want me traveling to the West for the first time alone. So I was persuaded to stay with family, and I thought I’d rather make the best of my trip than sulk about not visiting other sought-after locations in Europe.
I arrived in Vienna on a Monday and spent the day with my cousin, just resting at home. The next day, I planned to visit Schönbrunn Palace and booked a tour around the city from GetYourGuide to see the most important centers around the city center or the Ringstraße.
Vienna is a city that is truly a mix of art, intelligence, war, and grandeur. Today it’s one of those nations, that is not a part of NATO, and in the past, it was not a part of the Allies but was occupied by them. Austria comprises 9 provinces(federal states), with Vienna being the capital city of Lower Austria province. It has continuously been ranked in the top position as the most livable city. It has an immensely well-connected public transport where for every place in the city, you will have access to a tram, a bus or a U-bahn station.
I leveraged this highly interconnected public infrastructure and booked a ticket on the Wien mobile app to venture out for my first day of sightseeing alone. The fun part of traveling alone is that I have the complete freedom to decide what I want to see, when I want to see it, and how I want to see it.
The Schönbrunn Palace was my first choice because it topped the list of the must places to visit in Vienna and looked extremely magnificent. I got a ticket that also included an audioguide. Apart from the public transport and infrastructure, one stark difference is tourism in Europe is well-planned and structured. Every place I visited, I had the option to opt for an audioguide which would brilliantly explain the tiniest detail of that place.
Schönbrunn Palace was the summer residence of the Habsburg dynasty who had ruled for over 600 years in the Austrian region. The current architecture was modeled and remodeled during Maria Theresa’s reign who was the only female to ever hold the position in the empire. This palace along with its Gardens is also categorised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The Palace embodies the Baroque architecture which is known for its illustrative fresco paintings, grandeur, and opulence. To create a sense of luxury, marble and gold are used extensively. Domelike ceilings are adorned with intricate fresco paintings. Schönbrunn Palace comprised various rooms that depicted the imperial architecture, paintings of the various rulers of the Habsburg dynasty, miniature paintings, and elaborate halls where weddings were conducted.
One of the rulers of Austria was Franz Joseph I, and his infamous wife Sisi.There is an entire Netflix series based on her life called “Empress”. Known to be an eccentric modern woman and a rebel in her time, she traveled all around Europe. She was always unhappy and very isolated but a beautiful woman nevertheless. She has been extensively marketed as the face of Vienna, with her kind of jewelry sold at exorbitant prices and her face on every fridge magnet or postcard.
One of the rooms of the Schönbrunn Palace contained her dressing room, where a figurine resembling her with long and lustrous hair was placed. The picture below shows this.
After I spent about an hour and a half at the palace, I had to reach a point in the city center where I was supposed to meet my guide for the walking tour. It was a treasure hunt in disguise to decode the route from the palace to the center, considering everything was written in German. After much strife, I managed to reach the center just in time to meet my guide, who was an extremely eloquent and funny woman.
Austria is predominantly Catholic with spectacular Cathedrals and Churches in almost every town and city. It was without a doubt that the walking tour would also start at a Church. We started at the Minorites Church which was a beautiful Catholic church made by Italians. Back in the day, there was a marginal population of Italians who lived in Austria and that’s how this Church came to be. It follows the Gothic architecture about which I will speak in just a while. However, the remarkable point about this Church was a grand-sized Mosaic picture of the infamous Last Supper(which of course was originally painted by Leonardo Da Vinci in Milan, Italy), but here it was Giacomo Raffaelli, who made this mosaic art piece. There is a funny backstory to this. Napolean, when he was married to, Marie Louise, one of the daughters belonging to the Habsburg Dynasty, wanted the original Last Supper in Vienna. He tried numerous ways to dismantle the mural painting from the refectory in Milan and bring it to Vienna but in vain. He then summoned Giacomo, who created a replica of the original mural painting but through mosaics. Even today, the replica is used to maintain and refurbish the original painting because a mosaic doesn’t fade away.
After the Church, we walked to Hofburg Palace in the Ringstrase. Since 1946, it has been the official residence and workplace of the President of Austria, who is just a figurine head of the state. It is also on the balcony of this palace, that Adolf Hitler had announced, on the 15th of March 1938, that Austria would also be a part of his idea of Germany. Many Austrians were also super enthusiastic Nazis. Adolf Hitler was an Austrian too.
Austria was a major global superpower before the First World War. It initiated the WWI when the erstwhile Austria-Hungary invaded Serbia in July 1914. When the war ended, Austria abolished the monarchy and became a democratic republic.
While walking through these important landmarks, we also passed the imperial library(which I visited on my last day), Albertina, and Spanish Riding School. During the walking tour, I also befriended two very sweet young ladies(in their 60s and 70s) from Scotland. They were extremely kind and inquired about all the places I would visit in the next couple of days. They even gave me a couple of suggestions on do’s and don’ts.
The highlight of the tour was saved for the end. It was the St.Stephen’s Cathedral. This resplendent Cathedral was constructed in a span of 300 years and the South Tower took about 65 years to complete. The beauty of Gothic Architecture lies in the tall spires. These spires which are visually spectacular also embody the aspirations of humans to reach God. Another remarkable architectural detail is the ornate patterns and the stories that are painted on the glass of the Cathedral. This was prevalent in medieval times since not everyone knew how to read and write, and paintings were the easiest way to communicate stories of religious importance.
With this, the walking tour came to an end, and so did my sightseeing for the day. I enjoyed a traditional Vienna dessert called Kaiserschmarrn, topped with plum sauce, which was brilliant. I also went up the north tower for a beautiful view of the city and booked a classical concert on the way back.
P.S : looks like I only managed to cover Day 1 in this article. I always wanted to chronicle my travels to Europe in as much detail as possible, and hence, I don’t mind writing multiple articles as long as I do justice to them. I will cover Day 2 in the next article.
Have you traveled to Europe or Vienna before? What was your experience?

The city has come to a standstill. Cafés, bakeries, and shops are hidden behind shutters. So, I stand here in the middle of a cobblestone street, clutching my phone as if it can magically summon a croissant. Or, anything to fill my empty stomach.
Yesterday, this same street was alive with the rhythm of the city. The low hum of voices. The sound of countless footsteps bouncing off the stones. But today, it’s as if someone pressed pause, and I don’t know what to do with myself.
Then I remember it’s Sunday. By law, most shops in Austria are closed to honor the Christian tradition of it being a day of rest. People are still, but in a way that doesn’t feel like an absence. Instead, it feels like a choice, like the entire city has collectively decided to pause. To breathe.
The slow pace of Vienna on a Sunday morning is a stark contrast to back home, where Sundays are a time to catch up on errands. To check off tasks from a never-ending to-do list. And I must admit it feels unnatural at first. Almost wrong to let the day stretch out before me with no agenda. No plan. But as I wander through the streets of Vienna, I realize something. The…

Frequently, people ask me about my life in Vienna. I give roughly the same answer: “Vienna is an interesting city.”
An interesting city for sure. Unlike Madrid or Budapest — cities I found very welcoming — Vienna, for me, was not love at first sight. Neither was it love at second sight or the third, for that matter.
But Vienna was the right city at the right time. It’s an imperial city, and it has a lot to offer: museums, art, culture, cleanliness, quietness, and more.
While this may sound like a slow-burn love affair, it’s not. Not fully, at least, or perhaps not yet.
Unlike most major cities, such as Paris, London, New York, Barcelona, Berlin, Prague, or even Budapest — which was once part of the same Empire and — built, in parts, to emulate the wealthier neighbor, Vienna is a “hidden city.” By hidden city, I mean that the nice architecture is not “in your face.”
Vienna is like the introvert of cities, a little more reserved than its extroverted cousins. The grand palaces and monuments do not jump out at you, but once you peel back the layers, the architecture and history are simply fascinating.
Frequently, I meet tourists near the Belvedere area — where I happen to live — who can’t find the Belvedere Castle. “How can you miss a castle?” one, who has never visited Vienna, might ask. You can, if the castle is downhill and the walls around it cover its beauty.
But once you find the Belvedere, it’s truly breathtaking. The baroque architecture and the beautiful gardens make it a feast for the eyes. It’s almost like a secret garden, but with a royal twist.
And the Upper Belvedere is one of my favorite museums in the city. It contains stunning artwork including many pieces by one of my favorite artists, Gustav Klimt — himself a rebel among his contemporaries.
The Belvedere Castle is not the only famous landscape that’s hidden. Vienna is like a game of spies. The most well-known landmarks are like the city’s best-kept secrets.
Hidden again, the Schönbrunn Palace. A fairytale castle, surrounded by gorgeous gardens and fountains.
Also hidden, Volksgarten, with its beautiful statues and beds of roses is a hidden oasis in the heart of the city, and perhaps the most important of them all: the Imperial district. The district is home to some of Vienna’s most iconic landmarks like St. Stephen’s Cathedral, but it’s not exactly obvious where it starts and ends.
The most famous place and institution when it comes to music, Musikverein — which contains the same hall where the famous New Year’s concert is held, also seems nothing special from most angles, except the main entrance. Hard to believe that the famous Golden Hall is placed somewhere inside that, perhaps unimpressive, building.
“You see that?” a friend asked the months we were in Vienna. “That’s Musikverein. It’s so famous in China [the country she was born in] and it looks so plain from here.”
Musikverein may look ordinary, given the surrounding architecture, but inside, it’s a total stunner. The Golden Hall is the star of the show — all gilded and ornate with famous acoustics that just make the music touch your soul deeply.
Another question I get asked a lot is “How do you compare Vienna to other cities you lived before?”
I think comparing Vienna to the other cities would be unfair. In almost all the cities I previously lived with the exception of Budapest, I was a poor student, and the activities I could do were limited.
It’s not a fair comparison. To me, it feels like comparing apples and Wiener schnitzel.
Vienna is rich in history, cultural offerings, and elegant architecture. But the move to Vienna was not voluntary, my employer relocated, and I even found myself in Vienna after a separation, with all of a sudden more free time on my hands. I get to occupy that time with cultural activities.
Yet, despite its cultural richness, Vienna is known for being conservative, rigid, and at times, unwelcoming. [Vienna keeps getting ranked both as one of the most liveable cities and most unwelcoming to foreigners.] This is especially true for women, who are often expected to adhere to traditional roles such as raising children, and for third-country citizens. I belong to both of these categories.
At times, it feels like the city is still holding onto its 18th-century manners or something of the like. And while the cultural activities are great, the rigidity and the resulting bureaucracy can be a bit of a killjoy.
Now and then, as a reminder that you live in a country that has frozen time, one may even get shouted at in some cafes. Sometimes it feels almost as hard to penetrate as trying to get into a high-society ball without an invitation.
So, when I am asked about my life in Vienna, I confidently say that it’s a chapter of my life that has shaped me in unexpected ways (and continues to do so).
It may not have been love at first sight, but it is on the path of becoming an important chapter in my life’s story. Living here has highlighted even more the disparities and expectations placed upon women and outsiders, yet it has also offered opportunities for more understanding and empathy.
Vienna has made me question norms and values, pushing me to explore the intersection of tradition and modernity. The city definitely brings out the part of me that calls for social change.
Where does this desire come from? I don’t know. What I know is that I will listen to it and do what I can to be the change I’d like to see. Writing these Medium articles is a step toward that change. After all, change happens one step at a time.
Thank you for taking the time to read about my thoughts. If you enjoyed the article feel free to reach out at arieda.muco@gmail.com or on Twitter, Linkedin, or Instagram. Feel free to also share it with others.

Vienna is so special to me… It will always be the city with unforgettable many memories. I feel tons of emotions on that trip: fear, love, excitement, suspicion, admiration, understanding, enthusiasm… Vienna is waiting for me, again.
Vienna is filled full of first experiences for me. First trip, first abroad, first flight… I am grateful that it all started with Vienna.
I have two of my best friends while in Vienna, we explored together, we laughed, we danced (it was so funny), tasted…
We stayed in the most beautiful hotel and after many experiences, it still protects its place on my top list. I can recommend it with peace of mind. Our receptionist was cheerful, friendly and sincere. He talked about his travels to our home country, tried to talk in our main language, sent videos about our traditional foods on WhatsApp… When I look at our hotel’s photos or think about it, I feel the beautiful smell of the hotel exactly. Magical.
We arrived in Vienna in the evening, and after settling in the hotel, we went to Mariahilfer Street. Since it was the first time, I was shocked by the early closing of the shopping places. The life stops early… I am not used to it.
The second day in Vienna started with a meeting with our Erasmus student friend at Karlskirche, it was a long time since we had seen him. Also, we met with a student from Vienna Technical University who was very interested in cars and Austria.
Our city exploration started! There were a lot of architectural masterpieces… Fascinating!
I had a detailed plan for the itinerary, nevertheless we started to be ahead on the plan. We went to Hundertwasser Houses and Prater on the second day instead of the third day.
I think we give the biggest appreciation to Prater… Me and my friend really like the Before Sunrise movie, and the place was special for us. We recorded videos, spent many times at the photo booth cabin, watched… It was fun.
My friend had kept talking about Wiener Rathaus since we arrived, her excitement spreaded to me. First, the architectural beauty captured us, then a closer look… Ice rink, fancy ornaments… All was magical. There was a song playing, suddenly we started to dance haha it was silly but funny! We stood right next to the ice rink and started watching around. I tried to keep that atmosphere in memory with every detail. Kids were skating, laughs were everywhere. Also, the screen on the building shows the area sometimes, we were seeing ourselves on the screen. Shaking hands… Our cheeks were hurting from smiling!
Third day, again St. Stephan Cathedral. One of the favorite spots…
We went to gothic Votivkirche.
We had melange on a cafe has Votivkirche view. It was delicious and despite of being soft coffee served with water, interesting.
Bonus Memory!
I studied for my lesson and before coming to Vienna, I researched Sisi and watched the trio. There were many references in the streets. Understanding them was making me feel satisfied.
Overall
Vienna is a little bit over the student budget. I want to visit Vienna again with a rich budget and at that time I must spend my time in the museums, have schnitzel in a more elegant restaurant, go on the Christmas time and skate at Wiener Rathaus.
Regards, Özlem.

I wrote this at the end of December but it has been stuck in drafts.
Looking back it was a lovely day and such fascinating history I saw.
Enjoy!
I was thinking about a hike today, but then I woke up to rain and wind so I quickly squashed those plans.
Instead, I decided to walk over to the Hundertwasser Museum, a place I’ve wanted to visit for a while.
Friedensreich Hundertwasser created eclectic buildings and works of art. The trash incineration plant in Vienna was even designed by him after the old plant burned down.
The museum building itself stands out, and the inside continues the themes. The floor is uneven so you experience it like nature. There is so much to see inside with art work, biographical details and so much more. Just fascinating and well worth the visit. Of course the museum has a shop and a cozy café to while away the time. Perfect for a rainy afternoon!
On the way to the museum, I discovered yet another piece of classical music history when I happened upon the building where Beethoven completed his 9th Symphony in 1823/24, one of my favorite pieces of music: so powerful!
Everywhere you walk here there is a plaque indicating some classical musician or other famous character lived.
All in all a relaxing and enjoyable day in Vienna. And more reasons why I love living here.
Happy Holidays!

I love Vienna! I've only visited once, but it's a beautiful city with a fascinating history. I recently read Richard Cockett's Vienna: How the City of Ideas Created the Modern World, which left my head spinning. I wish you didn't have to write about book censorship there as well, but I'm glad that you are doing it. Thank you!

I moved to Vienna from Britain in September 2004. Initially, I wasn’t sure how long I was going to stay, so I decided to make the best of whatever time I had in this magnificent city and visited all the main sights in short order.
Schönbrunn Palace, St. Stephen’s cathedral, Belvedere Palace, Karlskirche, Prater…this place is just brimming with wonderful things to see and do. If you’re lucky enough to be here for a longer period, you can get off the beaten path and discover some of the city’s lesser-known gems.
After almost 20 years living in Vienna, it’s these tiny, unknown points of interest that make out the charm of the city I now proudly call home. The ones standing unnoticed on street corners, in shop basements, or even next to train lines. Passed by thousands of people every single day, they are part of the urban furniture and topography; and yet only a few locals know their true significance.
Tucked away in a tiny courtyard in the 4th district, a stone’s throw away from Karlsplatz, the Heumühle (pictured above) is a monument to the area’s past.
The nearby U4 subway line follows the line of the Vienna River (Wienfluß), a lively tributary of the Danube that runs down to the river from the surrounding hills. During the 13th century, a mill stream was built to divert water away from the river and power a series of water mills: the Bärenmühle (“Bear Mill”), the Schleifmühle (“Grinding Mill”) and the Heumühle (“Hay Mill”).
Milling in this area continued until the mid-1800s when the mill stream was filled in and both the Bärenmühle and the Schleifmühle were demolished to make way for new urban developments as the city grew.
The Bärenmühle is commemorated in the name of a block of modern flats built on the site, as well as the passageway built through a part of it (Bärenmühlhaus, Bärenmühldurchgang). The Schleifmühle lives on in the name of a street in the area — the Schleifmühlgasse.
Only the Heumühle remained standing. Concealed by new city developments, it was left by its owners to crumble for many years.
That solid 14th century construction wasn’t going anywhere too fast though, and a renovation in 2007 returned the mill to its former glory (or at least structural soundness).
These days, the mill houses the showroom of an office furniture company and can be viewed by curious members of the public during the day when the gates to the courtyard are open.
Being an ancient city with multiple layers of history, there’s plenty to discover under Vienna’s streets — from Roman remains to concealed waterways to cinematically famous sewers (think: The Third Man).
A particularly special feature of subterranean Vienna can be found in the first-level cellar of the house on the corner of Ertlgasse and Kramergasse in the 1st district (now occupied by a shop).
The vaulted ceiling of the old brick cellar contains one of only two surviving “Josephinian columns”. These supports were built into the cellars of the houses lining the Rotenturmstrasse in the early years of the 18th century in preparation for the transport of the famous “Pummerin” bell from the shores of the Danube to its destination, St. Stephen’s cathedral.
The Pummerin bell, partially cast from the iron of Turkish cannons captured during the siege of 1683, was so heavy that people feared transporting it up the street would cause the street to buckle and collapse into the cellars below. Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I ordered these columns to be built into the foundations of the surrounding buildings to help this project of city pride to its completion.
The old Pummerin bell hung in the north tower of St. Stephen’s cathedral until 1945 when it suffered a devastating fire in the final months of the 2nd World War. The vast bell fell to the ground and smashed into several pieces.
The new Pummerin, in situ since 1957, is only rung on important occasions (e.g. the death of the Pope, new year). Just like its predecessor, it is a beloved symbol of peace and regeneration after the carnage of war.
Close to Schwedenplatz lies one of Vienna’s oldest churches: Maria am Gestade. “Gestade” is an old German word meaning “shore” or “bank”. Looking at the church in 2023, this might seem a little confusing as it clearly isn’t located next to the river and the Danube Canal is still a few minutes’ walk away. However, before the Danube was regulated in the 16th century, this church did actually sit on the banks of an arm of the mighty river. Local lore tells that this is the place where river fishermen would dock and say their prayers.
Besides being a very beautiful building and marking the start of a pilgrimage route, the church has an unusual feature which harks back to Vienna’s earliest days as a Roman settlement. If you stand at the main entrance of the church and look down towards the high altar, you will see that the building has a slight “kink” in the middle.
This subtle asymmetry in the church’s construction is because it was built along the lines of the early city walls — which themselves followed the boundaries of the Roman camp of Vindobona.
The Romans, being fans of both symmetry and sound military logic, built their garrison in a perfect rectangular shape with two sides backing onto the river and its direct tributary, the Ottakring stream. That left them with only two sides to defend in the event of an attack. However, being at the intersection of two waterways also left them seriously exposed to flooding.
Which is exactly what happened. Archaeologists believe that extreme flooding in the 4th century resulted in the northwest corner of the Roman settlement (located at the point where the Ottakring stream flowed into the Danube) collapsing into the river and being swept downstream (check out this illustration for a better understanding).
The pragmatic Romans adjusted to the reformed geography and rebuilt the settlement’s boundaries along the new, post-flood line of the river bank: the line we now see in the crooked construction of Maria am Gestade.

Vienna (Austria) is divided into 23 districts — administrative areas of different sizes and with their own specific characteristics and charm. Vienna districts are both numbered and have a name, so it is easy to navigate. Their numbers are linked to postal codes, so if an address in Vienna has a postal code 1210, it is in 21st district (middle number from postal code 1210). Here is another example — 1010 is a postal code from first district — 1010.
Also, street names displayed on plates are numbered with district numbers, so if plate reads 4. Prinz Eugen-Straße, this means you are in the 4th district. This makes navigation through Vienna really easy.
From 23 districts, first nine are considered inner districts as they are located around city center. The remaining 14 districts (10–23) are considered outer districts as they are further away from the city center.
Here is the list and brief info about Vienna districts with their postcodes (zip codes):
The main, central district located in the geographical center of Vienna. Home to Stephan Platz (Stephansplatz) and St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom). This is the main tourist flocking district with many important landmarks and high-end shopping and dining areas. It is a part of the Old Town and has couple of pedestrian areas popular with tourists and Vienna resident alike. Innere Stadt is circled with Ringstraße, spacious boulevard following the route of former city walls.
The first district is a home to Kunsthistorisches (Art History) and Naturhistorisches (Natural History) museums, National Library and several other important museums. The district has many palace buildings, mostly from 19th and early 20th century: Palais Niederösterreich, Palais Dietrichstein, Stadtalais Liechtenstein, Palais Porcia, Palais Starhemberg, Palais Esterhazy, Hochhaus Herrengasse and main ne being The Hofburg.
Leopoldstadt is the district on the island between the Danube and the Donaukanal. It shares the island with 20nd district, Brigittenau. It is home of Praterstern, city’s busiest traffic node, and Prater Park with Viennese Giant Ferris Wheel. Second districts has several more landmarks and attractions such as: Augarten park with Palais Augarten and Porcelain Factory, Wiener Sängerknaben (Vienna Boys′ Choir, also in Palais Augarten), Carmelite Church (Karmeliterkirche), Karmelitermarkt, Produktenbörse (Corn Exchange) and Kirche St. Leopold.
Leopoldstadt has a strong Jewish heritage and also unfortunate history as Jewish people were gathered from here to be send to the concentration camps during the Holocausts. Today, Jewish presence in culture and commerce is revived and thriving in the second district.
The second district has very central position and it is well connected to the city centre, so it is very popular residential area as well, with much lower rent than 1st district.
Landstraße is next to Innere Stadt (district 1), right on the right side of the Donaukanal. It includes Belvedere Palace and central train station of Vienna, Wien Mitte. Apart from Belvedere, there are few notable cultural institutions in this districts as well: Kunsthaus Wien, Hundertwasserhaus Wien, Akademietheater, Konzerthaus and Heeresgeschichtliches Museum.
There are also several palaces of historical importance: Schwarzenberg Palace, Palais Schwarzenberg, Palais Wittgenstein and Palais Rasumofsky. Third district also have several churches from different denominations and architectural styles: Gardekirche, Elisabethinenkirche, Rochuskirche Church, Kirche Maria Geburt and the Russian Orthodox Church.
From other landmarks, it is worth mentioning Schwarzenbergplatz Square with Hochquellbrunnen Fountain, and the Soviet War Memorial.
Wieden is a small district in south to the city center and includes Karlsplatz with famous Karlskirche and also the Vienna University of Technology. Notable attractions and landmark also include Wien Museum, Naschmarkt, Theklakirche, Paulanerkirche and Elisabethkirche.
This district is popular with tourist in the area of Karlsplatz and Naschmarkt.
Margareten and Wieden were one district until 1861. It is a small district, almost identical in size with Wieden. Famous for being a home to Austrian Society and Economy Museum, known globally for introduction of Vienna Method, data visualization method.
This district also has history in labor and workers movement all the way before WWII. It was greatly destroyed during WWII and rebuilding of it took some time. Today, the district has its charm and you can find very cheap rental and very near to the city center.
This is another of the smaller Vienna districts, part of the central city area. Popular with shopping and dining area along Mariahilfer Straße and also includes Haus des Meeres Aqua Terra Zoo, Vienna aquarium.
Academy of Fine Arts is located in this district, and this is a reason in somewhat bohemian feel in the area, since district is filled with small art galleries and art and artisan souvenir shops.
Theater an der Wien is also in Mariahilf district. Mozart’s Magic Flute was first performed there. Joseph Haydn, another famous classical composer, lived in Mariahilf area. He lived near the Kirche St. Aegyd, which is now affectionately called Haydnkirche.
Another notable church in the area is Mariahilfer Church, Baroque style church from 18th century.
Mariahilf is a district popular with tourist also because offers many streets for walking and wandering around and looking at the small shops or have coffee break in one of many cafes.
Neubau is another small district, but it is a host to the Museumsquartier, a large museum and gallery complex. Leopold Museum, MUMOK, Kunsthalle Wien, Architekturzentrum, ZOOM Kindermuseum and MQ POINT are just selected top cultural institution of about 60 located in the area, which makes it one of the biggest in Europe.
Many cafes, bars and restaurants in the area are making visit to Neubau enjoyable and you can always expect some street performance in and around Museumsquartier, especially in summer.
Other than Museumsquartier, the 7th district also is a home to Volkstheater, ‘people’s theatre’, built in 19th century, Hofmobiliendepot, museum of Imperial furniture and Stiftskaserne, former monastery turned into military base that had some dark history, especially during WWII.
As in the rest of central Vienna, there are several churches in the area: Altlerchenfelder Church, Lazaristenkirche Church and Ulrichskirche Church.
Josefstadt is the smallest one of the Vienna districts. It is situated adjacent to the Rathaus, and close to the Austrian Parliament and the University of Vienna. The district is mostly residential, but there are still number of landmarks to visit. There are several palaces in the area: Palais Schönborn, hosting Österreichische Volkskundemuseum, a Museum of folk art and culture; Palais Auersperg, Palais Trautson, Palais Damian and Palais Strozzi.
There is a district museum with works of Klimt; Theater in der Josefstadt and Vienna International Theatre are two established performing arts institutions. There are also several small cabaret and small theater scenes around the district.
There are three notable churches in the district: Piaristenkirche Church, Dreifaltigkeitskirche and Mechitaristenkirche.
Alsergrund is the last of the inner districts and it closes the circle around city center. It is the area of the General Hospital and Vienna Medical University district, and also Sigmund Freud’s Museum.
From other attractions in this district, we can mention: Votivkirche Church, Palais Liechtenstein (owned by royal family of Liechtenstein) and Roßauer Kaserne, large building which hosted military base in the past.
Favoriten is one of the larger districts with largest population so far. It is located in the southern part of Vienna. On its northern border, there is main train station, Wien Hauptbahnhof, and Vienna’s thermal spa in its southern part.
From notable landmarks in this district we can mention following: Spinnerin am Kreuz, a rare Gothic shrine, depicting several scenes from the Bible; churches — Oberlaa, Laarberg and Salvatorkirche; Starhemberg Kaserne, army base built at the beginning of the 20th century, and 19th century water tower, construction of a historical importance.
Simmering is a fairly large district, located next to Favoriten and on the right side of the Donaukanal. It is one of the oldest districts of Vienna, with the written records from the early 11th century.
It hosts some quite unique landmarks, such as: Gasometer City, former gas tanks converted into an apartment and office complex and Wiener Zentralfriedhof, Vienna Central Cemetery with around three million people burred there.
From other attractions in the district it’s worth mentioning Altsimmeringer Pfarrkirche, parish church from 18th century and two parks — Herderpark and Hyblerpark.
Meidling is a small district on the southern bank of the Wien river. Current Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz was raised there and has private residence is Meidling.
There are few attractions in this district: Schloss Hetzendorf and Schloss Altmannsdorf, both used as educational institutions; Südwestfriedhof, the second largest cemetery in Vienna and Haydnpark, among others, smaller public parks.
Hietzing is on the southern bank of the Wien river, and on the west of Vienna city area. It includes Schönbrunn Palace as one of the top attractions in Vienna. But, Schönbrunn Palace is not the only attraction in this, arguably, greenest district of Vienna (after all, the entire area was hunting grounds for Habsburgs). Lainzer Tiergarten is large nature reserve where imperial family was doing exactly that — hunting. And also, relaxing, as there is a villa there — Hermesvilla, frequented by Emperor Franz Joseph I and his wife, Empress Elisabeth (popular ‘Sisi’).
Heitzing was always area populated with aristocracy in past times, and now with their descendants or wealthy people in general. This is weirdly noticeable in local cemetery, Friedhof Hietzing, where expansive tombs are built for deceased wealthy citizens of the district, and not with much artistic taste.
Gustav Klimt is also buried there and this is a reason enough to visit this cemetery. Also, there is a Klimt Villa in Heitzing, where the artist lived and worked until his death in 1918.
Penzing was one district with Heitzing until they were divided into two districts in 1938. Located on the northern bank of the Wien river, the district is famous for Otto Wagner’s Church — Kirche am Steinhof. The church is set in the center of the compound of former psychiatric hospital, one of the largest in Europe at the time.
Otto Wagner also designed two villas in Penzing, aptly named Otto Wagner Villa I and Otto Wagner Villa II. They were, of course built in the Art Nouveau style.
From other notable attractions, we recommend Technisches Museum (Technical Museum) and birth place of Klimt in Baumgarten.
This district is also quite green almost half the territory is with parks and gardens.
Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus is on the northern bank of the Wien river and it is a small district surrounded by six other Vienna district form the area. It is a district with highest percentage of foreign-born population in Vienna. One of the main train station, Westbahnhof, is located here.
From notable attractions in this district we can mention Maria vom Siege church and Stadthalle, large concert venue.
Formerly a village of Ottakring, this western district is now a thriving neighborhood famous for its brewery and large Balkan immigration, especially from former Yugoslavia. The district lived through the population and construction boom in 1920s, during ‘Red Vienna’ period.
Today, its Brunnenmarkt is a fair competition to famous Naschmarkt, and there are several areas with distinguished charm throughout the district. This is not a touristy area so attractions are few, but these are landmarks to visit: Schloss Wilhelminenberg (now a hotel, but you can go there for a coffee, or better, a mélange), Wallfahrtskirche zur Heiligen Theresia vom Kinde Jesu, a pilgrimage church whose name is not easy to pronounce (or remember), Heuriger 10er Marie, a classic tavern to have a nice break and Kuffner Sternwarte, the observatory, one of the three in Vienna.
Hernals is the district stretching towards northwestern outskirts of Vienna. This is also not touristy area and there are not many interesting things to find there. Locally famous churches to visit there are Kalvarienbergkirche, the Sühnekirche, and the Marienpfarre. There is also a palace with a park, Schloss Neuwaldegg, worth visiting.
Währing is on the northwestern of Vienna and includes the Türkenschanzpark and University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences. There are several notable buildings/castles in this district, such as Schloß Pötzleinsdorf.
This is also mostly residential district with very few attractions of interest to tourists.
Döbling is northern district and it is one of the larger ones. It is famous for being a residence of Beethoven and it hosts Japanese Garden.
Karl-Marx-Hof, large apartment complex dating back from 1920, period of ‘Red Vienna” is also in this district.
What makes this district popular is its location on the outskirts of Wienerwald, Vienna Woods, where many people go for outdoor activities.
Brigittenau was one district with Leopoldstadt, until they were made two districts in 1900. Named after Brigitta Chapel, built in 17 thcentury. Other churches in this district include Kirche zum Göttlichen Erlöser and the St. Johann Kapistran-Church.
Floridsdorf is large district located on the left bank of the Danube and in the north of Vienna and includes combination of industrial and residential areas. This can be considered suburban district in general terms. There are very few attractions or landmark to see here, such as Donaufeld church or Mautner Schlössl with districy museum.
Donaustadt is also on the left bank of the Danube and is the largest district of Vienna, occupying almost one quarter of city’s area. It is a host of the Vienna International Centre, large campus and building complex of the United Nations Office in Vienna and several agencies and also Vienna’s largest conference center.
Alte Donau (Old Danube) is a popular recreation area, together with small national parks and several public parks throughout the district.
Liesing is the southernmost district, which is also one the least populated Vienna districts. It includes the Wotruba Church, an unique example of Brutalism in architecture. There are also castles/palaces: Schloss Liesing, Schloss Rodaun and Schloss Alterlaa, villa Hofmannsthal-Schlössl and large park of Alt-Erlaa. Other than that, Liesing is mostly combination of residential and commercial buildings.
This is just a brief description of each of Vienna districts. We hope this will be useful starting point in exploration of the city. We will be writing in more details as we add articles about attractions and landmarks around Vienna. Safe travels and see you soon!

If you’ve ever dreamed of stepping into a real-life Christmas wonderland, Vienna in December is the place to be. From twinkling lights draped across historic buildings to the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts filling the air, the city feels like something straight out of a fairy tale. I had always heard that Vienna was one of the most magical places to visit during the holiday season, but nothing prepared me for just how breathtaking it would be.
Reaching Vienna is easier than you might think. If you’re flying in, Vienna International Airport (VIE) is well-connected with flights from all over the world. From the airport, you can take the City Airport Train (CAT) which gets you to the city center in just 16 minutes. If you’re coming from a nearby European city, trains are an excellent option too, offering scenic routes through Austria’s picturesque countryside. I took a train from Munich, and as the snow-covered landscapes passed by, I knew I was in for something special.
Vienna is famous for its Christmas markets, and let me tell you, they do not disappoint. Here are a few you absolutely cannot miss:
The most iconic of them all, this market in front of Vienna’s City Hall is like something out of a holiday movie. With over 150 stalls selling handcrafted gifts, ornaments, and delicious food, it’s impossible to leave empty-handed. I grabbed a cup of Glühwein (mulled wine) and wandered through the market, soaking in the festive atmosphere.
For a more elegant setting, the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market is perfect. The backdrop of the grand palace makes everything feel even more magical. This market is ideal for finding high-quality artisan gifts and tasting traditional Austrian holiday treats.
Tucked away in narrow, cobblestone streets, this market feels cozy and intimate. It’s less touristy, making it a great spot to experience Vienna like a local. Here, I tried Kaiserschmarrn, a shredded pancake with powdered sugar and plum sauce — absolutely divine!
One of Vienna’s most famous landmarks, this Gothic cathedral looks even more stunning with Christmas lights twinkling around it. Climbing to the top rewards you with breathtaking panoramic views of the city.
Not only does this palace house Gustav Klimt’s famous painting The Kiss, but it also has its own charming Christmas market. Walking through the snow-dusted palace gardens at night was like stepping into a dream.
If you love music, you cannot leave Vienna without experiencing an opera or classical concert. I managed to get last-minute tickets to The Nutcracker, and it was pure magic. The combination of Tchaikovsky’s music and the grandeur of the opera house made it an unforgettable experience.
Vienna’s winter calls for rich, hearty dishes that warm you up from the inside. Here are a few must-try foods:
This classic Austrian dish — a breaded and fried veal cutlet — is crispy, golden, and absolutely delicious. I had mine with potato salad at Figlmüller, a restaurant famous for its schnitzel.
No trip to Vienna is complete without trying the world-famous Sacher Torte, a rich chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam. The best place to try it? Café Sacher, of course!
A warm slice of Apfelstrudel (apple strudel) with a side of vanilla sauce was the perfect dessert to enjoy at a cozy café while watching the snow fall outside.
One of the most magical moments of my trip was ice skating at the Rathausplatz Ice Rink, right in front of the beautifully illuminated City Hall. The atmosphere was electric, with Christmas music playing in the background and families gliding across the ice. I hadn’t been on skates in years, but somehow, in that moment, I felt like a kid again, completely lost in the joy of the season.
Vienna in December is more than just a destination — it’s an experience that stays with you. There’s something about the combination of history, music, food, and festive spirit that makes it feel truly special. Walking through the snow-covered streets, wrapped in my warmest coat, with the sounds of classical music drifting through the air, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and peace.
If you’re looking for a holiday getaway that feels straight out of a storybook, Vienna is the place to go. Trust me, once you experience Christmas here, you’ll want to come back every year.

All great cities lay claim to at least one golden moment. While we might quibble over what’s required to earn that label, one thing seems clear: Fabled destiny often coexists with searing contradictions.
Vienna in 1900 was a perfect example.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the imperial city of the ruling Hapsburgs and Europe’s cosmopolitan center of music and pleasure. It was home to Sigmund Freud and the two Gustavs of music and art (Mahler and Klimt ), a pantheon of poets, composers, literati, and theater notables; a yeasty mix of immigrants from throughout the sprawling Austro-Hungarian empire; the sixth largest Jewish population in the world; and plentiful parks, palaces, coffee houses, and heart-stopping pastries.
Yet as Stefan Zweig (1881–1942) — Vienna’s native son, member of the city’s Jewish bourgeoisie, and famed author — understood well, Vienna’s underbelly was in ferment. Suicide was rampant. So, too, were syphilis, cholera, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Infant mortality was high and life expectancy low at a mere 38 years. Anti-Semitism was also on the rise as was the disaffection of youth, shackled by rules and norms governing every aspect of life.
With the help of Zweig’s 1942, 450-page autobiography, aptly titled The World of Yesterday, here are some keen observations of this…

Grateful for those who speak English while we study German
St Stephen’s Cathedral on a gray February day- Author photo
I’m not so sanguine about writing here on Medium-using just my iPad, not really sure where to publish. I comment a lot. For those who follow my comments, you might notice a wide range of subjects.
My wife and I rented an apartment in the 18th district of Vienna starting November of 2024. This came about from a desire to leave the US and certain business opportunities in Austria. We have been catching up to the process of moving while in the middle of several projects, including listing our home for sale on the East coast of FL. This required more time than we expected, and delayed our move until two weeks ago.
As soon as we arrived in Vienna, we left for Cyprus to attend a course and visit some friends. So we have actually been in the apartment for about six days. We ordered a nice mattress from SchlafTEQ right before we left for Cyprus, and they got it to us when we returned. So that’s our furniture until our container arrives in four more weeks.
We managed to buy a washer/dryer Monday, which arrived yesterday, just in time to start washing our clothes. Of course it is small compared to the monster LG units we had in Florida. It also takes two or three hours to process a load. But the clothes come out beautifully clean.
We were in the first district of Vienna yesterday, running errands, looking at furniture to complement what is coming by container. We stopped into the luxury grocery store, Julius Meinl, to buy a few items, and the cashier sarcastically commented to the patrons behind us: “tourists,” as we fumbled for unfamiliar coins. Not sure what she expects from the first district, which sees millions of tourists a year.
And we are newbie ex-pats, or maybe even immigrants, working our way through the challenges of culture, language and a new location. So it’s on us to adapt, to be respectful. To learn the language, and to accommodate the changes with grace. We are so grateful that we speak English, and that so many Viennese, especially the younger ones, speak it so well.
We ae both very excited to be here, and a bit overwhelmed by no furniture, new language, cold weather and an unfamiliar neighborhood. Almost everyone we meet, when we explain to that we came from Florida asks “But why would you move here?” Not knowing how the US has become a place of strife, bad food, unkind culture, a insanely expensive medical system and a waste of resources.
Not that I do not have great respect for the good things in the US, and there are many; it is that life, for us, even with all the challenges here, offers all of the elements in Vienna that please us-food, culture, an enticing city, public transport, and ultimately a real community. We are also very happy that Vienna is such a great hub to explore all of the EU and beyond.

Visiting Vienna is like taking a step back through time. The imposing architecture, glamorous cafe’s, expansive beer halls, and slow, relaxed pace of life make visitors feel as if they are living in a black and white film. While there is certainly a modern element that vibrates through the metro area — particularly during commuting hours — , Vienna generally runs on a pulse that syncs to the slow, steady chime of the church bells that ring throughout the city every hour on the hour. This ambient environment combined with delicious cuisine and a rich culture attract millions of visitors to Vienna every year.
There is so much to see and do, one could easily spend an entire day roaming around each of the uniquely beautiful districts, discovering all the hidden gems that Vienna has to offer. If, however, you are limited to spending only a few days in the city, here are a few tips from a local on how to hit the highlights while still having an authentic, Viennese experience.
Walk the Ringstrasse
Many of the most popular sites lie along the two and a half-mile epicenter of the city — the Ringstrasse. While many visitors take the seven-euro tourist tram ride to view all the architecture in rapid succession, the best way to fully appreciate these magnificent buildings is to pass them slowly and on foot. I suggest starting at the Schottentor metro station and strolling down toward the Rathaus and around. Here is a post that highlights many of the more significant landmarks you will pass along the way. Once you make it all the way around and are back near Schottentor, pop into the Melker Stiftskeller restaurant/wine cellar for dinner or a late lunch. The cuisine is true authentic Austrian — that is, packed with salt, heavy cream, and every other sinful ingredient that is a treat for the taste buds. A large Schnitzel and a few pilsner beers are just the things to revive you after your walk.
Buy Lunch at Naschmarkt and Picnic at Schloss Schonbrunn
On a Saturday morning, Naschmarkt — an open-air farmer’s market — will be packed with people buying fruits, vegetables, and exotic treats like olives, hummus, and freshly fried falafel. While you likely won’t want or need to stock up on groceries during your stay­, you should absolutely sample some of the goodies on sale at Naschmarkt. I suggest purchasing a smorgasbord of picnic supplies and hopping on the metro to Schloss Schonbrunn. You can enter the surrounding park for free, find a bench or a grassy spot, and enjoy lunch among the beautifully groomed gardens. Afterward, you may consider touring the inside of the castle.
Have Coffee at a Viennese Café
Café culture is an integral part of Viennese history. During its golden era after World War I and before World War II, many Viennese aristocrats made their fortunes by importing sugar for the pastries that lined the café display cases. As a result, many coffee houses around the city are now protected UNESCO world heritage sites. A visit to the city would not be complete without a Mélange and an Apfelstrudel or Sachertorte in one of these famed cafes. Places like Café Central, while very beautiful, are typically packed with tourists. It may be worth battling the crowds to check out the interior decor, but it won’t be quite the authentic experience you might be looking for. To fully enjoy the “public living rooms of Vienna” in a more relaxed setting, head somewhere that is slightly less popular but every bit as beautiful. I suggest checking out Cafe Sperl or Café Schwarzenberg.
Visit Klimt at the Belvedere
There are many art museums in Vienna, and if you are an art buff, you’ll probably want to visit more than just one. But if you only have a few days, the must-visit museum is absolutely the Belvedere. The building and surrounding gardens are a work of art in themselves and the museum houses paintings by Vienna’s most beloved artist, Gustav Klimt. His most famous work, The Kiss, is to Austria what the Guernica is to Spain or The Statue of David is to Florence. After your visit to the museum, hop on the D line street train (Strassenbahn) heading west and find your way to 7 Stern Bräu for a krügerl (pint-ish) of traditionally brewed beer.
Hike in the Viennese Vineyards
Vienna may be well known for its beer production, but it also produces enough wine to imbibe the entire city. Just outside the city, visitors can sample Viennese wine and hike around centuries-old vineyards that are still producing today. There are over 190 Vinters scattered in the foothills outside the city and dozens of restaurants where you can enjoy seasonal cuisine featuring fresh greens, mushrooms, or berries that are harvested from the nearby forest. Check out this post with a few recommended locations and spend the day drinking your way from winery to winery.
Vienna has so much more to offer, and as a newly minted local, I am constantly discovering places worthy of this list. However, if you only have a few days in the city, these recommended activities will ensure you experience some of the touristic highlights while having an authentic Viennese experience.

At least its not Bratislava
We went to Vienna mid-August of 2019. I’ve been there previously two years ago but now we opted to go together. As you’ll no doubt discover we’re both passive-ish tourists. Not that we won’t be out for the entire day when we’re abroad but often our days would start past 12pm and we’ll find ourselves taking an Uber rather than running since 6am with five backpacks. Maybe that’s to come in a few years but for now its comfortable beds all the way.
It’s not everyone’s cup of tea but if you’re into arts, Baroque European architecture and a strudel or two then its the place to be. Unlike places like Rome or Paris, Vienna doesn’t suffer from swarms of tourism. Don’t get me wrong it’s not dead on the streets but if you’re used to lining up for 6 hours to get into The Colosseum you will be pleasantly surprised having to wait 10 or so minutes to get into most major attractions.
So what about museums? There are plenty of those. I had a leaflet that listed 50 or so but I looked it up and there are a 100 plus. You can pick what you’d like from Royal apartments, natural history or horses there is plenty for everyone apart from people who don’t like museums. If that’s you then go to the Film Museum as its closed for the summer.
Since Vienna is in Austria and Austria is German you can’t avoid the art college crowd. Thankfully they keep to themselves here and only provide Vienna with modern art and overpriced food. If you would like to spend 25 euros on a porridge and a smoothie Ilona would recommend Superfood Deli.
The entire city centre is littered with good shops from the fanciest H&M building to your average Saint Laurent. There is also a very large shopping street slightly outside the centre for more regular things like Esprit and mymuesli.
However if you want IQOS cigarettes like Ilona then you will have to take a train to Bratislava (which we did).
Vienna has one of the most reliable Metro systems we’ve been to. For 17 euros you can get an unlimited travel pass for a week (7 days). This includes the metro, trams, buses, all that stuff. Everything is very well connected. Vienna also has Uber and Uber with Lime integration. That’s their electric scooters. There are also other brands that do the scooter service but we use Uber so here we are.
Vienna has the first Hard Rock cafe we tried in Europe that wasn’t greasy. And to be honest with the most polite staff too. Plachuttas Gasthaus zur Oper is another great place, we went for Schnitzel. For amazing Apple Strudel a good place to go would be Residence Cafe and Restaurant which is right next to Schönbrunn Palace. Sacher cake is also a must try! Ok it’s just chocolate cake but its a really really good chocolate cake.
What if you realise 25 euro porridge is not your cup of tea? What do you do then? You run to your nearest Billa supermarket and grab a poppy seed Strudel to fill you up with goodness.
You can also find your usual Spar and a re-branded Aldi but you won’t have to make that hard choice as all places are always well stocked with good food that’s well priced. Also they have some great sausages.
Honorable mention: I got a muesli with milk and a yogurt, both were under 80 cents.
This time we got an AirBNB. It was perfect. Was hosted by a lovely chap called Christian, who was more enthusiastic than most hotel staff I encountered. The apartment was 3min from one of the main shopping streets and metro and we slept with the windows open because it was so quiet.
We give Vienna a solid 9/10
Ok bye thank you.

Vienna got voted as the unfriendliest city but this one trick might help you.
Culture is beautiful. Every country has its own unique way of doing things. When I lived in the USA for six years, I got to know a new culture. A culture that is loving, caring, friendly, and patriotic. Extremely patriotic. But more on that another time.
Let me tell you about the one big difference between Americans and Austrians.
When I came to the US, the first thing I noticed was that people were friendlier. If you walk down the street, people might ask how you’re doing. For the Viennese, this is confusing. No one asks you how you’re doing in Vienna.
I remember that I didn’t know how to react to this friendliness. What was I supposed to say if I was doing badly? I had to try it. Interesting things happened when I said that.
I remember this one time when someone approached me and asked:
“How’re you doing?” Stranger
“I’m ok. How are you?” I replied.
The stranger was gone.
Uhm, I asked, “How are you doing!” Why would you keep walking? Plus, I said I’m ok. There is more I have to say. Come back, you human; we have to talk.

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

Living in the world’s most liveable city comes with its own challenges! Vienna is one of the best cities in the world, however, it has lots of space for improvement — especially when it comes to digitalization.
Austrians love their Euro bills and coins and won’t replace them completely with digital payment solutions anytime soon. More and more businesses are adapting to the digital movement, however, you can’t leave the house completely without Cash. You always need to think about carrying some Euros with you as money businesses still require you to pay in cash.After talking to some business owners we agreed that there is only one main reason for the slow adaption:
High commissions for digital payments and it’s not sustainable for businesses to allow customers to pay lower amounts with cards. Business owners pay a fixed rate of 25 cents to 45 cents per transaction PLUS a percentage of the transaction sum. It totally makes sense from a business point of view to allow card payments only for bigger transactions.
Once we started traveling a lot we started to appreciate these long opening hours in other countries. Shops in Austria are only open 6 days a week from around 7 AM to 8 PM and are closed on Sundays. When I say closed, I mean completely closed. No grocery shopping on Sundays and Holidays. There are some exceptions at main train stations and airports, but these are crowded and aren’t really meant for regular shopping.
If you’re moving to Vienna, coming from a country with strong small-talk culture, you might experience the holy private space of Viennese quite early.Privacy is one of the most important assets here in Vienna and you don’t exchange this information with strangers. Like many other topics, it has its pros and cons, and there is no right or wrong. However, that’s something that I’m missing here in Vienna. I’m originally from Iran and small talk is part of our culture. Talking to strangers without invading their personal space is totally normal, which is in most cases a very nice experience and it’s boosting your mood automatically. Of course, there are also negative experiences but I think in general it’s a good thing and is more a cultural thing, so it can’t be adapted that fast.
The older you get the more complicated it gets to meet with your friends or loved ones. That’s why I’m a big fan of flexibility and spontaneity. Meeting loved ones shouldn’t become rocket science and you should be able to meet them whenever you feel the desire. Everybody is or acts super busy and opens their online calendar when you want to schedule an appointment. That’s maybe a point which most people don’t consider as a problem, but I think you only realize it once you experienced the opposite. Planning is healthy and everybody should do a little bit of planning, but don’t forget to live the moments and make space for some flexibility. If you’re a spontaneous person feel free to be a good example when living in Vienna :)
If you’re a handy person and love repairing your fridge, washing machine, pipes, and other home projects, then this point is not for you. But if you’re like me and have two left hands and need help to repair all of these things, then Vienna will welcome you with very high costs.To give you an example: The ice-maker of our fridge is broken for two years now and tried to fix it with YouTube videos, but didn’t succeed yet. So the problem is not that I’m greedy and don’t want to spend 100–150 euros to repair it. The main problem is that at the beginning you don’t really get a clear picture of the upcoming costs, because you pay only 100 € for the technician to arrive and have a look at the root cause. If you’re lucky the technician finds the root cause and replaces it for you right away. But if not, you could end up paying around 500€ for new parts and replacement costs. Labor is very expensive in Austria and it has the effect that many people try to repair everything by themselves, which has a nice side effect. You get handier and gain new experiences :)
We have also a YouTube Video on the same topic! Feel free to watch it and let us know in the comments below what annoys you most about your city.

I recently visited a Louis Vuitton store in Vienna, and honestly, it was an experience I won’t forget anytime soon. Here’s a casual rundown of what I saw and how each little detail was clearly designed to give you that luxury vibe, all while using clever marketing strategies that make you feel extra special.
As soon as we got there, we noticed that only a handful of people were let in at a time — if someone left, only then would someone else get a chance to step inside. This controlled entry isn’t just about keeping the crowd at bay; it’s a smart scarcity tactic. By limiting the number of guests, LV makes you feel like you’re part of an exclusive club, boosting that “I’m really getting something special” feeling.
Right at the door, a friendly doorman greeted us with a big smile. Moments later, a staff member came up, asked for our name, and asked what we were after. It felt super personal — like they were really interested in making sure we had a great time. This personal touch is all about relationship marketing; they want you to feel known and valued, not just like another face in the crowd.
While wandering around in the store, we noticed every item was displayed with gorgeous lighting and plenty of space. Each product got its own spotlight, which made them look extra tempting. This kind of visual merchandising is a classic move to trigger those impulse buys — making everything look so exclusive and high quality that you just want to take it home.
At one point, we had our eye on a particular bag, but it was behind a counter with a staff member busy chatting with someone else. We waited a bit, and when we asked to see it, she casually said, “I’m busy right now, but if you’re on our list, someone will be with you soon.” It was clear that they’re all about consultative selling — taking their time so every customer feels important rather than rushed.
When we were about to leave, a man with a tablet approached and confirmed our name, saying someone would assist us shortly (not only he had our names but probably realised that we were leaving as no one was attending us). Then, he assigned another staff member who, introduced herself and led us to a cozy seating area. Firstly she asked if we would like water, tea, or champagne. Serving a drink might seem like a small gesture, but it’s a clever way to build trust through the reciprocity principle — making you feel that the experience is all about taking care of you. She also asked some very basic but important discovery questions like what we were looking for, is there anything we found, are we looking to buy a bag for a specific occasion or in general and then casually slipping in between the conversation that not all products are displayed so we can ask for some more products in case we do not manage to zero in on something.
Out of our 3 shortlisted bags she showed us the bags one at a time and allowed us to ‘try’ each bag , diving into details about each one — talking about colour, how it would work for different occasions, and even how exclusive it was — all without mentioning the price until we asked. Not only that she tactfully during the conversation mentioned how we can save taxes, without making us feel offended. A neat trick in luxury marketing: keeping the focus on the quality and the experience, not just the cost.
When it looked like we were not ready to decide on the bag we have shortlisted, she immediately offered to show us another option that might be a better fit for our taste. This kind of adaptive, consultative approach really makes you feel taken care of.
And then, just when we thought we were done, and about to leave without the bag (obviously because we came in for window shopping & experience), we asked if the bag could be delivered to us at our hotel. She confirmed it right away and then casually mentioned that she’d be going on vacation the day after next day and would only be available until 6:30 PM tomorrow. This little nudge of urgency was so subtle but effective — it made me feel like we needed to act soon without ever feeling pressured.
Throughout our visit, she never once pushed us to buy something. Instead, she let us enjoy the experience — showing one bag at a time, giving us all the details, and making us feel like we were the only customer that mattered. And when we asked for more water before leaving, she was right there with a tray, rounding off the experience with that extra touch of courtesy.
All in all, our trip to Louis Vuitton in Vienna was a perfect blend of luxury, personal attention, and smart marketing that makes you not just a buyer, but part of an exclusive experience. It’s clear why LV is a legend in luxury retail — every detail is designed to make you feel like you’re part of something truly special.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that, so we took a train from Bratislava to Vienna. The ride was only 60 minutes long, and both of us took the opportunity to read. I was close to finishing Atlas Shrugged and wanted to savor the final pages. Sitting next to Caroline, I was able to do that. Somehow, the silence we shared during that ride was just as romantic as the previous night. Neither of us needed to fill the air with words just for the sake of it. That’s a quality I love in not just women, but all people. Being able to shut the fuck up shows a security in one’s self.
The train station wasn’t far from the downtown area of the city, so we walked around to look for a hostel. We had no luck. When we finally got too tired to carry our bags, we stopped in a bar. We drank whatever the bartender suggested, some local beer I’m sure. That part alludes me. I usually remember what I drink in every bar. I won’t be able to tell you who was there with me, but I almost always know what I was drinking. What I do remember though, is that David Hasselhoff’s music was playing the entire time. I hated it from the jump, but had no clue who the artist was.
“What is this garbage we’re listening to?” I asked Caroline.
“It’s David Hasselhoff.”
“That’s crazy! In America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch.”
“Are you being serious right now?” She asked, incredulously.
“Yeah, the same exact name.”
“IT’S THE SAME PERSON, YOU DODO.”
“Wait, so he’s a musician too?”
“This is blowing my mind,” she said. “He’s like the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He has more than 20 albums.”
“Ok, now you’re blowing my mind.”
“And, we have Baywatch in Australia too. I don’t live on the moon.”
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. The fact remains though, that shit was painful to listen to. His music sounds like a knock off of Depeche Mode, but more robotic and cheesy. Luckily, while sitting at the bar, we met a few fellow backpackers. You can find the answers to most problems in a bar. You can find the causes too. They were nice enough to walk us over to the nearby hostel they were staying at. Fortunately, there were rooms available.
It was one of the nicest hostels I’d seen up until that point. There were multiple recreation areas, along with a courtyard that had one of those chessboards with foot-tall pieces. I taught Caroline chess there. The kitchen was really nice too. There were even nice wooden tables to sit at while we enjoyed the free breakfast provided each day. It was a nice change from having to eat standing up. The only thing they didn’t have was a bar, otherwise it was perfect.
I finished my book that afternoon in the courtyard while sitting next to Caroline. I felt emotional putting it down for the last time. By then the pages were completely worn down and both covers were gone. It looked like it had been through a war, and maybe it had, considering it was a late 60’s edition that I’d bought near Washington Square Park a few months prior.
I’d already finished all of Ayn Rand’s books at that point and needed more words to burn through. Instead of reading though, I decided to write some letters. I’d bought some cool, vintage airmail envelopes (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border) in Amsterdam and really wanted to use them. I got some paper there too. For me, at the time, it was all about thin paper. Whenever I found it I had to buy it. I wanted the stuff as thin as a newspaper. I also knew I’d potentially write a book about the trip one day and wanted some documentation. I made copies of the letters by hand before sending them.
Caroline and I weren’t staying in the same room that night, so when I was done writing I said goodnight and went to bed. It was the earliest I’d gone to bed throughout the whole trip.
The next day, I woke up and took a walk by myself. I just wanted to explore and enjoy the nice spring weather, no plans at all. Again, museums were out of the question, so I just popped some Adderall and let my feet guide me. I could wander for miles on Adderall. I could do anything for hours on it really.
After a bit, I found myself in an outdoor shopping mall. While I was window shopping I faintly heard the sound of the Wu-Tang Clan song Triumph playing in a nearby store. When I looked to my right, it all made sense. It was a skate shop. I entered looking like one of the Goonies after they found One-Eyed Willy’s dabloons.
A guy who worked there was standing in the doorway. I said to him,“You have no clue how good it feels to hear Wu out in the wild. I’m from America and damn have I been missing hip hop. I thought all you guys played in this country was David Hasselhoff.”
“Haha, we listen to other stuff,” he told me, in better English than I expected.
“I’m going to a Raekwon show in Amsterdam next week.”
“Really?!”
“Yeah, I was already there a couple weeks ago, but I can’t miss this show. Plus, I need to buy more weed.”
“I can sell you some.”
I told you, drugs come to me.
I paid him 60 Euros for a quarter ounce of above par weed, and he gave it to me right in the store. I thought about buying some Nike Dunks as a good gesture, but thought otherwise after seeing the prices. I never understood people who spend all of their money on shoes. Then again, I spend all my money on weed, so…
We shook hands and said goodbye.
“If I ever come back to Vienna, this will be my first stop.”
“Cheers.”
When I returned to the Hostel, Caroline was there.
“What’s up lady?” I asked, playfully.
“I heard about a good bar that’s in walking distance. Some guy over there told me about it. He described it as weird and completely empty.”
“Perfect.”
“It is, right?”
“I meant you. You’re just perfect.”
“Aww, you make me blush, John McEnroe.”
“Please…”
The bar was everything the guy said it was. It looked more like an empty Chili’s than a bar. There were way too many booths, and the bar only sat 6. Normally, I’d sit at the bar in that situation but Caroline didn’t want to take the chance of getting stuck with an English speaking ex-pat blabber of a bartender.
Beers turned into Sambuca shots very quickly. She was the one ordering this time, and I was certain she was trying to ply me with enough liquor so I’d finally make a move on her. Obviously, it worked. A man can only be so strong, even the best ones.
We disappeared one after the other into the men’s bathroom, as to deceive the bartender into thinking it was a normal bathroom run. Again, very Danny Ocean of me.
We started kissing as soon as she opened the door. Then I put her on top of the sink and… Well, the rest I’ll leave to your imagination.
After a few minutes of fun, we fixed our clothes and left the bathroom. I can’t be sure of the reason but as soon as the bartender saw us, he asked us to pay our tab and leave. As I told you before, being asked to leave is way different than being thrown out.
We kissed and fondled each other on the walk back to the hostel. I hadn’t experienced that since college. I don’t know if there’s anything better then a fondle walk. It really makes you feel like a teenager again.
When we got to the hostel, we sat and chatted before going to bed.
“I think I want to go to Germany tomorrow. Do you want to come with?” I asked her.
“I don’t think so. I want to stay here longer and see museums.”
She was doing what I did to her, making me wait.
“I understand.”
We hugged, then stared at each other, our arms still intertwined. Neither of us needed words to express what we felt. We spent five magical days together. It didn’t need to be anything more than that. We were both content.
“Goodnight, pretty lady.”
“Goodnight, Mr. McEnroe. See you when I see you.”

Vienna is a thriving cultural hub with beautiful architecture and fascinating history. It was also named the “World’s Most Livable City” by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
That’s why I recently packed my bags and moved to Vienna. I wanted to see if the city lived up to the hype. And sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.
Here are my first impressions of Vienna:
While wandering the streets of Vienna, a street food stall caught my eye. I decided I would try some traditional Austrian food. Not knowing a lot of German or Austrian cuisine, I pointed to what I thought looked tasty.
“Käsekrainer” the man said.
“Danke schön (Thank you),” I replied.
He handed me a plate with the largest sausage I had ever seen in my life, cut up into small pieces. Then, he gave me a slice of bread and some ketchup on the side.

Vienna is the only city of my tour where I spent more time indoors than outdoors. So I didn’t take many pictures of the city and the buildings. The weather was über cold and my back was really aching from the weight of my coat and my camera, but the main reason was that it was Gustav Klimt’s city. And not only did he work on a lot of buildings in the city, but his paintings can be found in different museums as well. But before locking myself between closed doors, I took advantage of the first day’s beautiful sky to wander around the small paved streets of the city center. I felt many different things while discovering this new city. The buildings were tall and spotless, and the monuments were the biggest I’ve ever seen. Most of the city was painted in various shades of white: from pearl to ivory, pure white or cream. The contrast of white on the endless blue sky was incredible. In the very posh Main Street of the city center, I felt as if I were in a ski resort, without the snow. Vienna was an open-air museum, with a display of incredible works of art everywhere.
So my first day was focused on the city center, inside the tram lines that were drawing a circle around the center. I started to spot there and there some details of the Secession’s inspiration. The Engel Apotheke, the Ankeruhr Clock, the building on 16 Kärntner Strasse, the Cafe-Konditorei Aida… Of course I was not only looking at Art Nouveau details. The first day in a city was usually the time where I would be a proper tourist, viewing as much of the city as I could in one day, getting to know my surroundings better. Vienna was everything that I was told it was: majestic, monumental, very detailed and decorated buildings, quite easy to walk around on foot. There weren’t many narrow pre-renaissance streets like the Quartier Latin in Paris, for most of Vienna’s architecture is classicist, baroque or romanesque. However some remarkable exceptions can be found: the Hundertwasserhaus by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, an incredible expressionist appartement building, but also the Sezessionstil Palace, Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station, and the Kirche am Steinhof by Otto Wagner, three beautiful Art Nouveau buildings.
I use Art Nouveau and Sezessionstil to describe the architecture and art that can be found in Vienna. But to be completely accurate, I should even say Jugendstil. Art Nouveau is a global artistic movement that has spread through all of Europe, even as far as St Petersburg. However, it has a very specific name and style in every country.In France, and Belgium, it’s called Art Nouveau and, very much like the Liberty Style in Italy, it’s a very busy, detailed, asymmetric and decadent floral and organic design. In Spain, the catalan modernism movement is quite similar to Art Nouveau, but has more medieval, gothic and Arab influences. In the UK, it’s called Arts and Crafts and it’s already a little more stripped down, with more use of geometrical lines and symmetries. And to finish, there’s Germany’s Jugendstil, founded in Munich and that later influenced the Sezessionstil in Vienna. The Jugendstil movement is, like Arts and Crafts, quite close to the Art Deco movement in some ways, using geometric lines, which is something you couldn’t find in Art Nouveau. But there’s still a very strong presence of natural and organic inspirations. To me, the main characteristic that makes Jugendstil quite different from Art Nouveau is its Greek and Roman art and architecture style’s influences. Even a little bit of Japanese prints. Also, the recurrent use of mythological creatures, strong women and floral embellishments makes it a very one-of-a-kind artistic style. But I’ll write a longer and more detailed article on those artistic differences, that I got to learn and witness during my journey.
I was staying in a lovely hostel outside of the center, that took me some time on foot to get back to. There, I started to work on my daily pictures, when I met a guy from Alexandrie who was studying in Budapest and was staying in Vienna for the week-end. It was an amusing coincidence, and we began to talk about our common experience of Budapest and Vienna. He told me he intended to do a pub crawl the night after to meet people, but I didn’t feel like getting hammered with people I had just met in a city that I didn’t know much either. And knowing what happened to me on the next day, I guess I was right to be careful.
Traveling solo has up and downsides. And traveling alone as a woman has made me more concerned for my safety. But the only worrying moment during my tour was, surprisingly, in one of Vienna’s most central subway stations. Vienna was quite wide spread, so I had to take the subway/tram a few times during my stay if I were to be able to visit everything that I wanted. The second evening, as I was leaving the subway platform to get back to the surface, my peripheral vision caught the sight of a wary man locking his gaze on me, turning his heels and slowly walking towards me. My first reaction, as usual, was to pretend I hadn’t noticed him, as I tightened the grasp on my bag. My eyes scanned quickly my closest surroundings, as the man managed to slow his pace enough to find himself in my footsteps. It could have been a mere coincidence, was I thinking. I saw a few people on the escalator and rapidly climbed as close as I could behind them. The guy had suddenly caught up with me and hit his chest against my back, waving a drunken sorry, making the couple in front of me notice the situation. I decided to play it safe and gently poked the elbow of man before me. I silently pointed at the man behind, trying to make him understand I was not feeling secure. He nodded and spoke to his companion. I felt some reluctance on his part, but was quite decided to not find myself alone. When the escalator came to its end, I stayed close to them until I could see the other one hesitate for a few seconds before leaving the station in a different way. He might just have been a drunk like many people I had already stumbled upon in the metro, but this time my guts told me that I was a prey. And that is not something I ever want to feel again. At least those last seven years taking the metro alone in Paris had taught me some good instincts. But somehow I can’t help but wonder if it’s normal to be relieved to have developed such instincts. Why should anyone be scared to walk alone?
I decided not to let this unfortunate event put me to bed. I had lived an incredible experience a little bit earlier during the day, when I finally checked a box off my bucket-list: seeing my favorite painting, Judith und Holofernes.
My second day was destined to be spent going from museum to museum. I had done some researches on Klimt’s art, and had made a list of all the places to visit in order to see as many works of his art as possible (so yes, be prepared, the rest of this article is going to be very Klimt-centered). Most of his paintings could be found in the Belvedere Palace, an amazing baroque building complex a little bit outside of the center.The complex consists of two palaces, the Upper and Lower Belvedere. Unfortunately for me, the latter was closed for renovations (again). So I focused myself on the Upper Belvedere, where thankfully most of Klimt’s artworks were exhibited.
I arrived in front of the entrance and was welcomed by the beautiful sculpture of a Sphinx, in a very Jugendstil design. The main hall of the building was quite amazing as well, baroque carvings and sculptures all over the tall walls and large ceilings, all painted in the purest white. The whole place itself was a work of art. I began to travel through Austria’s history with paintings of the Habsburg Monarchy’s main leaders. I also admired beautiful landscapes of the countryside, and paintings of the country’s most famous artists through the centuries. I took my time, not wanting to rush the moment when I would finally set my eyes on the painting I came to see. And I finally set foot in the room where the first Secession paintings of Klimt were to be seen. I tried to stay focused on each and every one in front of me as I was slowly making my way through the room, not wanting to spoil myself by taking a full view of the room. First, the « Lady at the Fireplace », a Symbolism piece, where the main color palette Klimt used was black and dark grey, outlined by a simple golden frame. Then, « Josef Lewinsky als Carlos in Clavigo ». This one had already the influence of what would become later Klimt’s trademark: a geometric design, golden and greek-like details framing the main character in the center of the painting, and Klimt’s distinctive handwriting giving a name to the painting. After a disturbing but fascinating piece called « Die bösen Mütter » from Giovanni Segantini, where bad mothers were trapped on a tree with the child they wanted to abandon until they took their responsibility for it, I slowly turned to face the incredible Judith.
To be perfectly honest, the first thing that came to my mind was « Oh, she’s smaller than I had imagined » (people who saw the Joconde for the first time would understand the feeling). And yet, the size did not tarnish the beautiful arrogance of Judith’s expression. The end of the 19th century was a new page for women in Europe. They strongly believed in their rights and were ready to fight for them. They began to take a more important place in the world and in the society. They were no longer the pure, sweet and innocent mother figure like Marie-Madeleine that they were forced into for centuries. No, they had become Eve, capable of choosing for themselves what was right, to take the path to knowledge and therefore, power. And Klimt was quite aware of these changes. He used to say « There is no self-portrait of me. I am not interested in my own person as “object of representation”, but in other beings, especially female, and even more in apparitions. » Most of his female figures were strong, independent women. In the artistic movement he founded, the Vienna Secession, many female artists were included. Judith is the archetype of the femme fatale, described by Franz A. J. Szabo as a « [symbol of] triumph of the erotic feminine principle over the aggressive masculine one ». Male critics would depict her as a cruel woman, taking pleasure in the murder of her opponent. But that’s not what I feel from the painting. She’s arrogant, sensual and beautiful. But moreover, she’s powerful. She wasn’t afraid to use her feminity and erotism to trick Holofernes. But she did not do it to please herself. She did what she had to do to protect her people, and with the weapons that she could use. Women don’t have brute force, so they rely on other skills. Her facial expression does not say « I enjoyed killing Holofernes ». It says « See what happens when you underestimate women’s abilities ». Klimt’s Judith is a fierce strategist, who prides herself with the result of her plotting. Why should she be called cruel for that?
I could have stayed in front of the paintings for hours, taking in closely every details as possible. The metallic, golden and geometrical frame was designed by Gustav and created by his brother, Georg, the least famous of the Klimt Brothers and yet a brilliant craftsman. The jewels of Judith, especially her fascinating necklace, are an intricate mix of gold and precious stones. Her translucent cape is opened on her chest, showing her breast. And she holds Holofernes’ head against her hip, almost out of the picture, to illustrate that he’s not the main interest of the painting, merely a means to an end.
Next to Judith was Vivien, a sculpture by the master of Symbolism and member of the Vienna Secession, Fernand Khnopff. Although this sculpture and the global work of the artist are aesthetically breathtaking, he was not known to be very kind towards women, rather the opposite. I was quite surprised to see this association, for I believe Klimt and Khnopff did not share the same opinion on women. But females in Khnopff paintings are, very much like Klimt’s, ethereal figures of seduction and erotism, inspired by the Preraphaelist muses, and he was a true inspiration to a younger Klimt.
Exhibitions and museums tend to teach you a lot more than common knowledge on the artists behind the paintings that you can easily admire. I learned about Khnopff’s disdain towards women during the Petit Palais exhibition in Paris last year. And later in Vienna, I discovered that another painter that I admired, Egon Schiele, has served time in jail for abusing one of his models, an underaged young girl. Getting to know more about the men behind the art, learning about their retrograde values or hideous crimes led me to a point where I was wondering whether I should still admire their work. It was easy to do so when their paintings were just paintings. But knowing more about the artists however, brought up some conflicting emotions. The never-ending question of separating the man and the artist. To be honest, I still haven’t found the right answer to that question. So for now, I continue to admire Schiele and Khnopff’s paintings for the work of art they are, and since they’re long gone, they can’t benefit from that.
In the following room after Judith, were exhibited some of Klimt’s masterpieces: The Kiss, was in the center of it all ; some portraits: Sonja Knips, Fritza Riedler, Amalie Zuckerkandl, and Johanna Staude ; the unfinished Die Braut, and finally Adam und Eva. From Schiele could be found the marvelous pieces Tod und Mädchen, Die Familie and Die Umarmung. I spent many hours in contemplation of these paintings before leaving the museum, light headed and with a feeling of accomplishment.
I went back to the city center and grabbed lunch at the Palmenhaus, a beautiful greenhouse that was mostly turned into a restaurant, but still with beautiful trees inside. The left side of the Palmhaus was used as a butterflies greenhouse, so I took the chance to enter this eerie and enchanting universe. Then, I went to the Leopold Museum. I wanted to visit the Museum of Art History beforehand, where I could find Klimt’s Athena and Cleopatra’s paintings on the great hall’s walls, but the entrance’s fees of all the museums I wanted to visit began to pile up considerably. Culture in Vienna came with a price, and not a cheap one. The Leopold Museum was cheaper and different, more modern, so I was curious to visit it. And I was right to follow my instincts because the museum had a whole room dedicated to the Vienna Secession and some famous artists, including women like Alma Mahler, Emilie Flöge, Berta Zuckerkandl, Dora Kallmus… I also found more of Schiele’s paintings, Klimt’s Death and Life and more importantly, the amazing triptych Medicine, Philosophy and Jurisprudence. The latter is a reproduction of his original artwork, a controversial piece painted for the University of Vienna, that was unfortunately burnt by the Nazis in 1945.
But Klimt’s triptych was not the only inheritance of the Secession that fell in the hands of the Nazis. The Secession Palace was destroyed for they viewed it as a symbol of decadent art. However, it was faithfully reconstructed after the War. I visited the Palace on my last day in Vienna. I also came across a couple of Jugendstil buildings close to the Palace, like the Majolikahaus built by Otto Wagner. To be fair, there are two things that are really interesting about the Secession Palace nowadays: the building itself, and Klimt’s masterpiece of the Beethoven Frieze.
The Palace was designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a manifesto for Vienna’s Secession, an artistic movement created by artists such as Klimt, Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner, who resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists to rebel against their traditional (if not retrograde) artistic point of view. The Palace itself is a white, geometrical building with touches of gold and green. It’s the essence of the Jugendstil style: the roof is a giant globe of golden olive tree leaves, three owls are perched on the sides of the monument and the entrance is garded by three Gorgons’ heads, representing painting, sculpture, and architecture, and two geckos. The famous « Ver Sacrum » (sacred spring, inspired by antic italien rites), the Secession’s motto, words are pinned on the wall near the entrance, and you can read « Der Zeit ihre Kunst, Der Kunst hire Freiheit » (to every age its art, to every art its freedom) above the Gorgons.
Inside the Palace, in the basement, can be admired the Beethoven Frieze. It represents mankind’s search for happiness through the journey of a Golden Knight, followed by the figures of compassion and ambition. The Knight has to face dark forces such as the titan Typhoeus, his daughters the Gorgons of lust, intemperance and indecency, the three Fates, and allegories of pain, disease and death. But, thanks to the figure of Poetry in the last panel, the Knight reaches the « Ode to Joy », where five women representing the Arts are painted. The painting represents how mankind can appease its suffering through the arts. Klimt created here a total work of art, combining painting with music and architecture (through the use of space, the three walls, the high frieze, and the Secession building).
And that, was the most beautiful lesson to be learned while my artistic journey in Vienna was coming to an end. I ended up the day with a guided visit of the Burgtheater, where Ernst and Gustav Klimt had painted the ceilings with another friend, Franz Matsch. It was before they decided to resign from the traditional ways of the Association of Austrian Artists. And it’s the only place where you can find a little cameo of the three artists, and it might be the only self-portrait of Gustav Klimt that could ever be found.

Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a vibrant center of intellectual activity, nurturing diverse schools of thought that would leave a lasting impact on philosophy, economics, and the social sciences.
Two of the most significant intellectual movements to emerge from this environment were the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics.
While both were products of the same cultural milieu, they differed significantly in their objectives, methodologies, and areas of focus. However, they also shared certain parallels that make their comparison intriguing.
The Vienna Circle emerged in the early 20th century, primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, as a group of philosophers and scientists committed to the development of logical positivism (or logical empiricism). Their main concern was the logical analysis of scientific knowledge, with a focus on distinguishing between meaningful and meaningless statements. They sought to apply rigorous logical and mathematical methods to philosophy, with the goal of eliminating metaphysics and focusing on empirically verifiable statements.
Key figures in the Vienna Circle included Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath, who collectively aimed to create a unified scientific language grounded in empirical evidence. The Vienna Circle was particularly influenced by philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ernst Mach, David Hume, and logicians like Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Their work laid the foundation for much of 20th-century analytic philosophy.
In contrast, the Austrian School of Economics originated in the late 19th century with Carl Menger, whose 1871 work Principles of Economics introduced the concept of marginal utility. This school focused on economics, emphasizing individual human action, subjective value, and the limitations of central planning.
Unlike the Vienna Circle, which was preoccupied with logical analysis and the philosophy of science, the Austrian School concentrated on understanding market processes, capital theory, and the dynamics of economic systems.
Prominent figures of the Austrian School included Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek. Their work contributed to key economic concepts such as praxeology (the study of human action), critiques of socialism, and the importance of price signals in a market economy.
One of the most significant distinctions between the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics lies in their respective methodologies.
The Vienna Circle championed logical empiricism and verificationism. They believed that the meaning of a statement could only be established if it could be empirically verified or if it was a tautology in logic. This focus on empirical verification and the rejection of metaphysics led them to develop complex systems of logical analysis and to apply the methods of the natural sciences to philosophical problems.
In contrast, the Austrian School relied on methodological individualism and deductive reasoning from basic axioms, particularly the principle of human action, known as praxeology. Austrian economists were skeptical of applying mathematical models and empirical methods to economics, as they believed that such methods could not fully capture the complexities of human behavior and market processes. Instead, they emphasized theoretical analysis based on logical deductions from fundamental principles of human action.
The differences between the two schools also extended to their views on science and knowledge.
The Vienna Circle sought to unify the sciences through a common logical framework. They believed that by applying the methods of logic and mathematics, it was possible to create a precise language for science, free from the ambiguities of everyday language. Their goal was to reduce all scientific knowledge to a set of logical propositions that could be verified through empirical observation.
The Austrian School, on the other hand, was more skeptical of the application of scientific methods to economics. While they valued knowledge and understanding of economic processes, they argued that economics was fundamentally different from the natural sciences because it dealt with human behavior, which could not be predicted or measured with the same precision as physical phenomena. Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek argued that economics required a different approach — one that recognized the limits of knowledge and the role of individual decision-making in shaping economic outcomes.
Despite these differences, there were also notable parallels between the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics, particularly in their skepticism of central planning and authority.
Both schools were critical of grand metaphysical systems and authoritarian approaches to knowledge or governance.
The Vienna Circle sought to dismantle traditional philosophical systems that relied on untestable assertions, advocating instead for a form of empiricism that demanded evidence and logical consistency.
Similarly, the Austrian School critiqued centralized economic planning and interventionism, arguing that such approaches were based on flawed assumptions about the ability to predict and control complex economic systems.
Friedrich Hayek’s work, in particular, echoed some of the Vienna Circle’s concerns about the dangers of overconfidence in human knowledge. His famous critique of socialism emphasized the impossibility of central planners having sufficient information to manage an economy effectively — a view that resonated with the Vienna Circle’s insistence on empirical verification and skepticism of grandiose claims.
Ultimately, while the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics both emerged from Vienna’s rich intellectual environment, their legacies diverged significantly.
The Vienna Circle’s influence was most strongly felt in the fields of philosophy, particularly in the development of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of science. Their ideas about logical analysis, the rejection of metaphysics, and the emphasis on empirical verification shaped much of 20th-century philosophical thought.
The Austrian School of Economics, meanwhile, became one of the leading schools of economic thought, particularly in its critiques of socialism and advocacy for free markets. Figures like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek continued to shape economic theory and policy debates, particularly in the context of discussions about the role of government in the economy.
While the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics operated in different intellectual spheres, they shared a common context in the rich intellectual environment of Vienna. Both schools were skeptical of grand systems and central planning, yet they diverged in their methodologies, objectives, and areas of focus.
The Vienna Circle sought to apply the methods of logic and science to philosophical problems, while the Austrian School emphasized the importance of individual human action and the limitations of scientific methods in understanding economics.
Together, they represent two distinct yet parallel threads in the intellectual history of Vienna, each leaving a lasting impact on their respective fields.

“My dream writing room would be the Imperial Library in Vienna.” Fran Lebowitz
The word “cosy” means different things to different people. For some, it’s sipping a cup of chai in the comfort of home. For others, it’s watching your favorite series without interruptions. It might be talking to friends or family about something meaningful, or spending quality time with loved ones. In other words, it’s that moment when you’re truly yourself — when you’re not bound by any obligation, when you’re quietly loving yourself, and when you’re living, not just existing.
I try to find these cosy moments in my home, and today that moment came while painting a memory from Vienna. The art is far from perfect and still incomplete. The art is inspired from a church which was across our apartment in Vienna. I snapped a photo, thinking that one day I might paint it. Today, I finally did. When you visit a city, you carry it with you forever and Vienna is that city for me. Isn’t is beautiful you need not pay money to be an artist or a writer. Your own memories are enough. All you need is a pen and a paper and you keep doing it again and again as if that’s how you will attain salvation.
I’ll take my time with this. Watercolor isn’t my favorite medium, but I will try to do my best to paint the memory.
February Weeds & Wildflowers Writing Prompt is Cosy. Sharing today’s memory for the same. Thanks to the editors of Weeds and Wildflowers publication for the space for my rambling.

Vienna ooo nah nah, half of our heart is in Vienna ooo nah nah. 🎵
Leaving Santorini was an event — the airport was not built to support multiple departing flights and has the worst airport logistics we’ve ever seen in our lives! In short, it was chaotic, people were shoving, kids were crying, there was yelling and no space or direction to where you should go… so when we landed in Vienna… it was the most incredible thing.
It was silent, organized, we could flush toilet paper (!!! we didn’t know Greece has poor plumbing…) we had McDonalds following Maeghan’s goal to eat it in every country we visit, we downloaded our fav podcasts (and Maeghan has a cameo in one!!), and facetimed family from a bus(!!!!) with real wifi and saw our family in full-resolution… no more pixelated heads :D
And that was all just in the first 30 mins of being here, this city got even better after that.
We explored the beautiful buildings, the meaningful history and ate / drank the best things. Vienna is pretty awesome and we will definitely come back.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
Sisi of Bavaria was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary who had this building constructed for her and her husband to live in with plans to build an identical building across the way. She was sadly assassinated (by accident!) in 1898 and her husband stopped construction due to a broken heart.
Later in history, this Imperial Palace was used by Adolf Hitler to perform his famous speech, proclaiming Austria as part of the Third Reich.
And today, all the buildings are in such great shape… looking back, I think the Parthenon in Greece may have looked similar to this one back in the day 😃
Meet Claire 👋 she is an incredible woman we had the pleasure of meeting (by eaves-dropping and totally striking a cool Canadian conversation… 😊). She is an opera singer who is studying her masters in Austria. She shared a few hours with us talking about her work, some challenges and the philosophies she lives by as she trains to as a Opera singer. It was such an inspiring conversation. Claire had such a love/passion for Opera, so much so, that she wanted to share with us and gave us two free tickets to a show!!!
We ended up going our last night in Vienna, and it was pure magic.
So there’s a thing in Vienna, where you can go see the Opera with standing tickets. They only cost 3 euros!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year — yet advent is even more wonderful in certain locations.
Out of all the cities I’ve been to, and I’ve visited quite a lot in the last fifteen years, Vienna is by far the best place to be in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
Not only because of the food (even though it plays a vital role!) but also because of the traditions celebrated and the visual, glittery makeover of the city.
Here are six reasons why Vienna should be the travel destination of your choice for next December (if Corona allows).
Advent markets exist in many countries, but in Austria, they’re definitely the most beautiful! From small and rural to big and shiny — everyone will find a market to his or her liking.
More than twenty markets grow out of the concrete in Austria’s capital alone during November.
The most famous (and touristic one) is probably in front of the Vienna City Hall with over 100 booths. Another very popular one is situated in front of the Imperial Palace Schönbrunn.
But, why are they the best in the world? Surely, not only because of the locations? No, they have far more to offer.
Delicious food, yummy hot drinks, and arts and handcraft are sold here. For me, this is one of the most important aspects of a proper Christmas market.
I’ve been to markets in London, Paris, and Amsterdam but they all couldn’t keep up with the markets at home. They were far too posh and overdone, with a lot of tech stuff for sale, instead of traditional workmanship.
I prefer browsing through wooden stalls in soft lights, which display self-made candles, hand-made jewelry, knitted hoods, and gloves as well as or local delicacies.
I prefer to hear soft Christmas music instead of loud radio hits.
For one month only, I enjoy a life that doesn’t circulate around high-tech equipment and being the loudest.
Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas in Austria, without our markets, where vintage and traditional last-minute presents can be discovered.
Giant snowflakes hanging between Baroque buildings, illuminated trees guiding cars through the streets of the inner district, fairy lights shining from balconies and through windows in every other apartment.
It begins to look a lot like Christmas when the lights are switched on in the entire city.
White. Blue. Green. Red. Lila. In all shapes and forms.
There is nothing more magical than walking through the streets during December. Even getting stuck in a traffic jam feels less frustrating when shiny snowmen and glittering snowflakes guide your way.
In the shopping streets, every other shop plays Christmas music too. What a wonderful world …
The scent of roasted Maroni (chestnuts), fatty Langos, and Glühwein (mulled wine) stream through the streets like the wind.
Street booths that sell these chestnuts and potatoes pop up in every corner, giving our popular ‘Würstelstände’ a very hard time.
Yet, the culinary hot spots during advent are definitely the Christmas markets.
The choice of punch is overwhelming: Orange Punsch, Berry Punsch, Pina Colada Punsch, Jagatee, Eierlikör Punsch (egg nog), Tequila Punsch, Ginger Punsch, Elderflower Punsch, white and red Glühwein, and much more.
A perfect display of the multi-cultural heritage of this country.
You can visit every Christmas market in Vienna and still won’t be through all the flavors. Trust me, I tried!
The same is true for the food. You can start with a warming bread soup, continue with gratinated toasts or potatoes, taste some Krautfleckerl or Käsekrainer and finish with a cinnamon-drizzled Baumkuchen, chocolate-stuffed Krapfen, or chocolate-coated fruits.
The best part for me is always the tasting around. Many small, often family-owned businesses book a booth and bring their own products.
Just yesterday I tried the yummiest truffle-parmesan bread spread and a nice locally produced Gin.
No wonder my family and I always gain five kilos over December.
This is one of the most widespread Christmas customs in German-speaking Europe. You’ll find at least one of these decorative pieces in every family’s living room.
The advent wreath is made out of pine branches, which are weaved into a circle. It’s then decorated with small Christmas balls, wooden figurines, ribbons, or whatever you want to put onto it.
Four big candles are placed in the wreath, to be ignited one at a time on every advent Sunday while we sing carols, read verses from a Christmas story (or from the Bible), and eat homemade cookies. And drink some more Punsch.
The custom goes back to the 19th century, where Johann Hinrich Wichern placed 20 lights on a broken wheel. Over the years, the size and number of candles were reduced to their current form.
The tradition of Nikolo and Krampus remains one of the most cherished in Austria. It’s living folklore that has survived until today, and sparks joy and fear in the hearts of children.
Every year on the 5th of December, Austrian children position cookies, milk, and a pair of shoes by the entrance door or window to give the Nikolo energy for his travel through the country.
As a thank you, he leaves sweets in their footwear.
Then, on 6th December, St. Nikolaus visits Austrian homes and kindergartens in full bishop’s robe to assess if the children have been good or bad.
But he usually doesn’t travel alone — children must be aware of his servant, Krampus! Krampus is the complete opposite of the saint: a terrifying, horned, hoofed, and furry figure.
While Nikolo brings sweets and chocolate to the brave children, Krampus brings warnings (in earlier times also strokes) to the not-so-brave ones.
This tradition, especially the Krampus, is still very popular with adults, who like to dress up and walk the streets to frighten people.
So you better be good for one year, before you travel to Austria!
Vienna is not only known for the beautiful Christmas markets and classic music but also for its people and their grumpy-ness and Viennese ‘Schmäh’.
We have no patience, we get easily annoyed and we’re not too shy to let everybody around us know, even nice tourists.
But, when everything around us starts to glitter and shine, and when our sharp mind is lulled in by Punsch and mulled wine, our nerves get soothed and our heart grows bigger.
We forget to be grumpy and annoyed and can even be nice. So advent is the best time to meet Austrian people and make new friendships.
If that isn’t a Christmas miracle, what is?

It is the curse of my life that I can move faster than the seasons, hop between continents overnight and change countries like fashion but I can never escape seasonal allergies. I thought coming to Vienna from Croatia would be a good change of climate and that change of seasons would get rid of my allergies. Alas, the springtime pains continue.
I spent two nights in Vienna with enough time on the first day to walk around the city and take pictures of all the baroque and neoclassical architecture. I started off at the Wein Rathaus (city hall) and then wandered through a rose garden to the Ephesos Museum and later arrived at St. Stephen’s Cathedral. What I noticed the most along the streets were the decorations at the top and corners of the buildings.
Many of the older buildings have statues sculpted and moulded to tell a story that I do not know. I wondered if these semiotics remained relevant today and if knowing them would make the buildings any more significant or if they’re just meaningless decoration. Somehow I doubt it.
In Invisible Cities by Itali Calvino Marco Polo says, “You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.” To which Khan replies, “or the questions it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.”
Stephen’s Cathedral is the jewel of the city and it was kinda cool but also less impressive than I expected. Mass was in session so I couldn’t walk the nave but it wasn’t as tall nor as ground as other cathedrals I’ve visited.
On the south side is a tower 343 steps up to the bell tower. The entrance is sort of hidden in the corner. I thought there’d be more to it but it was literally a single spiral staircase going up and up and up. The only break was for the bell room, sans bell, and at the top it was a chamber to buy souvenirs with small windows on the four sides. I thought the cityscape would be more interesting but there wasn’t much to see. The roof had an interesting tiled pattern on it but even that was difficult to see from this vantage.
Since it was going to rain the next day I decided to check out some nearby parks to see if they were interesting. I walked along the canals and came to Augarten park which had a distinctly familiar tower. It was only after reading the plaque that I remembered seeing it in a YouTube video. These are two of six World War 2 anti-aircraft towers built to protect the city. One is a command/communication tower and the other is for the guns.
After my thesis I’ve taken an interest in the architecture of memorials and dilapidated structures. The architecture of this war has been preserved as a reminder to the horrors of forced labour under the social nationalist regime — but it got me thinking about how we preserve old and culturally important of structures. The towers are clearly decaying and concrete is spalling off. Around the base is a fence. They no longer guard the city but being surrounded by parkland are evident along the city skyline.
At first I wondered why the structure isn’t open to the public to climb and explore. Since it’s from a recent war and not a long ago castle or fortress this probably isn’t appropriate. It’s also apparently dangerous according to the youtube video because of a failed attempt to destroy it.
But to leave it to decay seems like a lost opportunity. Why isn’t there art? Murals or ribbons or lights that in the immediate term express peace juxtaposed to war. I’d first seen the towers from the top of St. Stephen’s cathedral. I’d thought them a fortress worth checking out. I suppose I was partly correct, but if they had been colourful and less stoic, maybe there would be a better relationship to the city. In the long term, seeing vegetation slowly consume the structure might be a suitable future. This would be better then the current state of decay as pigeon on roosts but I suspect realistically they will fall into disrepair to a state where the government has to demolish them.
I found this online, https://www.worldbook.com/behind-the-headlines/Mythic-Monday-The-Riddle-of-the-Sphinx:
The Sphinx is found in both ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology. In the story of Oedipus, the goddess Hera sent the Sphinx to plague the people of the ancient city of Thebes. This was punishment for an ancient crime, possibly the failure to atone for the crimes of a former king of Thebes. The Sphinx sat perched on a mountain cliff nearby the ancient city. The creature guarded Thebes with a riddle that she had learned from the Muses. Each time a traveler failed to solve her riddle, she devoured them, effectively preventing anyone from leaving or entering the city.
The riddle? “What being has four legs, then two, and then three?” Some accounts write it, “What has four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?”
After many people guessed incorrectly and were killed, the king of Thebes announced that he would give the kingdom to anyone who could solve the riddle. The road past Mount Phicion, where the Sphinx awaited her victims, was strewn with the bones of people who had failed to find the right answer. Eventually, Oedipus, fleeing Corinth, solved the riddle. He answered, “Man, who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two legs, and finally needs a cane in old age.” Upon hearing the correct answer, the Sphinx jumped from the cliff to her death. The plague of Thebes was lifted.
It would seem that Vienna is asking me what wonders I like while simultaneously holding me captive. But where the riddle has a simple answer, the question might be rhetoric. I’m not convinced that the answer is a wonder at all…
The wonders of Vienna seem to palaces and the most prominent is the Schönbrunn Palace. It was an 18th century summer home for the emperor and there are two tours of the inside. These tours have been scripted to move the highest volume of tourists through in the least time. Measured by the number of rooms (22 or 40) the latter takes just 50 minutes. Both are accompanied by audio guides to shuffle along the cattle and since photography isn’t allowed, there’s little reason to linger.
I was once again sniffled by being too old to get the student discount and ended up paying more because I visited the Sisi museum but didn’t get a combined ticket (the student rates would have been cheaper). The Sisi museum was more interesting because the second half was a story about the empress and had a narrative to follow. In both places I was surprised by the lack of luxury on the interior since there are so many other decorated buildings with statues and faces on the facades in the city. This might be because the emperor Franz Joseph was known for leading a simple life devoted to running the country. Another strange aspect of the two residence I saw, at the summer palace and in the city, were that the main rooms didn’t seem to be located central to the buildings. It was as if the emperor and empress lived to the side. There was a model of the palace and where the royal residence were was far removed from the centre.
While the buildings were somewhat of a disappointment, the Schonburnn gardens behind the summer palace was nice and free. I particularly enjoyed the Roman Ruins which were an artificial construct fashionable during the 18th century with the rise of Romanticism that symbolizes the decline of revered civilizations and the desire to preserve relics. Interestingly, romanticism intentionally creates ruins from scratch as a point of interest in the garden but does not actually preserve anything.
At the top of the hill the Gloriette Schloss Schönbrunn is an observation pavilion that looked cool but I didn’t purchase a ticket to go to the rooftop. Instead I walked around the base and then made my way back down the hill. Though it is a symmetrical garden, I was kind of surprised that the most colour was on the wings in the rose gardens. Between the palace and the hilltop was a fountain and just grass fields.
The architecture in Vienna was interesting but I found myself more interested in the typical 5 storey housing typology than the palaces or monuments. Many of these housing buildings were distinctly recognizable as Germanic and I would have liked to study the buildings and statues decorating the top more closely. Unfortunately the Airbnb I stayed was the ground floor of a grimy building of little historical significance. Other than a water fountain in the hallway, now brackish, there was little evidence of how people might have lived before a mid-century renovation. I made a poor selection in this AirBnB to save a few bucks. Neither did it help the war on allergies that the place had grimy floors or that the room smelled musty. After two nights I was very happy to leave.
I realized in my next destination that what draws me the most isn’t the seven or seventy wonders of the city but what might have been there before.

Vienna has a register for its trees. I learned this through my favourite crowd-sourcing app, iNaturalist. It allows identifying surrounding plants and animals by simply making a picture and uploading it through the app. A community of fellow users and iNaturalist algorithms suggest possible identifications.
I was scrolling on my way to give a talk but I still had some time, so I went into a park to observe some Viennese urban wildlife. One of my observations was a tree (probably poplar).
The observation is registered in iNaturalist as observation #22987310. Not long after uploading the images to iNaturalist I got the feedback that I should have listed the observation as a cultivated tree. “My” tree was apparently planted and it is 45 years old and has the tree registry number 30.
It is these kinds of interactions and data linkages, that makes me love iNaturalist and its community.

Throwback To 2020: Life In Vienna During The Initial Days Of The COVID-19 Pandemic,https://palarkaprabha.medium.com/throwback-to-2020-life-in-vienna-during-the-initial-days-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-a2dfe7fdd017,"Sign up

Read the Bangla version of this article that was published on Unish Kuri.
It was a reasonably chilly February afternoon when I first caught the attention of the sudden rise of COVID 19 cases in Europe as I made my way back home from a fine art event in one of the quintessential Viennese red and white trams. Most of these cases were overwhelmingly being reported from Italy and Spain. Like any other layperson, my initial reactions were a concoction of wishful reasoning, indifference, slight concern, and ignorance. I continued to plan and work on all the assignments and deadlines I had for the upcoming spring and summer months. My attitude was hinging towards being carefree and believing that the virus was “just another flu” with probably slightly more severe symptoms.
However, within a matter of one week, as the number of infected people and the death toll began to rise just across the border in Italy, I finally grasped the reality of the situation and realized that it was just a matter of days before Vienna and other neighboring cities in Central Europe faced the same crisis. By the beginning of the second week of March, Austria started recording many new cases of infection daily, and I had to cancel all my plans for the upcoming months immediately without second thoughts. I started educating myself rigorously on this coronavirus to avoid unwanted panic through misinformation and fake news and arm myself to the teeth in case of the worst. Living halfway across the globe from my family in Kharagpur, it was pretty challenging to fathom and accept this unprecedented crisis and the sweeping changes it would bring in the future, both at a personal and community level.
Austria decided to go into a complete lockdown on 16th March, as the healthcare systems in Italy and Spain were put to the test for the first time since the Second World War. The number of infections rapidly rose across the European Union, prompting the WHO to declare Europe the pandemic’s epicenter. For the first time in my life, I felt completely exposed to a severe crisis, a feeling which I had only imagined partially or grasped by reading newspaper articles on wars and calamities. There was a great hustle on the days leading up to the lockdown in Vienna, with people hoarding food, medical, and other essential supplies like toilet paper and sanitizers. I, too, had to rush to multiple stores and secure basic supplies as not enough guidelines were available in English in the initial days. There was an eerie feeling that it was the silence before the storm- an impending natural disaster or war-like aggression. The government was swift to tackle this problem within a matter of days by ensuring smooth and unhindered supplies and providing detailed information in English to the expatriate community on their official website.
The quarantine days have been very stressful for me like billions of others around the globe, worrying about the human cost of this pandemic, possible shapes and forms of the job market for young graduates like myself, and their long-term psychological impact. Amidst all this negativity, the only silver lining from my quarantine has been the rediscovery of latent interests I have had, ranging from cooking various meals to experimenting with various forms of sketching. I humbly acknowledge my privilege to be able to indulge in these activities. An interesting observation arising out of being locked in the same apartment building for weeks together in this period has been the growing sense of belonging to this city and my neighborhood, which I never felt before as a foreign student. It is a life-long bond that I will carry into my old age.
The strict lockdown measures were relaxed earlier this week, and further restrictions would be lifted by the end of April. Being the first country in Europe to flatten the curve, the authorities in Austria aim to put the country back into much-needed economic normalcy by the middle of May. It seems for the moment that the initial cannonball has been dodged as deafening silence and apocalyptic scenes of deserted streets continue to loom large over the breakfast servings of apple tarts and melange coffee in Vienna. If the current levels of precautions and alertness are not maintained, the virus might regain strength again and cause another wave of casualties. The historian in me hopes that the city will overcome this dark chapter like it repeatedly did in the past in the events of the Mongol threats, the Ottoman sieges, the Spanish Flu pandemic, and the horrors leading up to and during the Second World War. And I cannot help but wonder how in these days of fighting the coronavirus, Mozart would have composed a string quartet, Klimt would have painted, and Freud would have psychoanalyzed his patients

It’s been a while since my last blog! I’ve been taking some time to reflect on my summer, spend time with family and friends and have been swamped with Givesie and participating as a vendor at many local Portland events during the last few months.
But I am back this week and wanted to share with you my amazing trip to Europe this summer! I got the chance to visit Vienna, Austria and Zurich and Lucerne, Switzerland with my parents. It was by far one of the best experiences of my life! And to be able to share those memories with my mom and dad is priceless.
Vienna has this richness in history and architecture; the museums, the palaces, the statues, the cathedrals and gardens are breathtakingly beautiful and so intricate in detail! One of my favorite sights to see was the St. Stephan’s Cathedral, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna and the current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, which was completed in the year 1160. It is the most important religious building in Vienna, “has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city’s most recognizable symbols.” Walking inside I was immediately in awe of the stunning, yet dark and dramatic beauty of the interior. Words could not describe the sense of peace, calm and excitement I felt all at once walking through.
The Schonbrunn Palace is one of the busiest tourist sites to see in Vienna. It is a neoclassical style palace and was built during the reign of empress Maria Theresa and was also the home of Franz Joseph, the longest-reigning emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, along with his wife Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria. I loved touring through this palace, it was decorated exactly how it would have looked when it was first built. I felt like I had gone back in time, envisioning what it would have been like to be alive and living during the 18th/19th centuries.
Another one of my favorite places to visit was the Belvedere Palace. Consisting of two Baroque palaces, the Upper and Lower and set in the Baroque park landscape and the Belvedere garden, it houses the Belvedere museum. Walking through the museum I was surrounded by the most stunning pieces of historical art done by some of the most famous artists from around the world and from centuries ago! Definitely a sight to see!
As we wrapped up our tour of the museum we worked up an appetite — so, mom, dad and I had to stop at the cutest little café on the palace grounds for a late afternoon latte and pastry! So. Good.
After our amazing time in Vienna, we were off to Zurich and Lucerne, both are beautiful cities surrounded by stunning mountain ranges, lakes and charming medieval towns.
The train ride my parents and I took from Vienna to Zurich was probably one of my most favorite parts of the trip! It was an eight hour ride, but felt so much shorter! We had such a great time chatting, taking pictures, eating delicious meals, passing by and stopping through small towns, seeing the gorgeous mountainous scenery and huge lakes and rivers. We spent just a few days in Zurich, seeing Old Town, browsing through local boutique shops, shopping for souvenirs, as well as taking a day trip to Lucerne along with a boat ride on the lake. Even though it was a short time — it was absolutely perfect! I remember sitting outside this adorable French outdoor cafe by the lake and enjoying an afternoon espresso with my parents, while people watching — and thinking to myself — I can’t believe I am actually here and enjoying this beautiful moment with my mom and dad that I will cherish forever.
This trip gave me such perspective and such an appreciation for travel and exploration! Being in a new environment, new people, new culture. There is such a big world out there to see and experience. We tend to get caught up in our normal routines, the everyday tasks, work, etc…and tend to forget that there is so much to appreciate in life! Sometimes you just have to get out of your comfort zone and your norm to be able to see things in a new light. xx

A city that reminds me
Of a town,
Vienna,
The one with cool winds
And cooler heads.
On a Sunday,
Everyone gets a break,
The city shuts down,
As if on a curfew.
No shoppers or eaters
Roaming on the streets,
All establishments shut
And everyone stays home.
For an outsider
Vienna seems forlorn,
Like their city did during the lockdown.
But for insiders,
It is a paradise
As they enjoy time with family
At home.
Even on a Monday,
There is no hurry,
No running behind a bus or a train
No speed walking down the pathways.
Those going to the office or school,
Stroll at their pace,
Enjoying the winds
And the sun,
And their coffee in breaks.
They work at their pace
Enjoying the task at hand,
Undisturbed by the distractions,
As if in a mystic flow.
They cycle, calm and slow,
Not in a hurry to reach their destination
For them, the journey
Seems to be their destination.
Not formal wear,
No big cars or big frills
Just them in their shorts and ts
Going about their day
Like it’s a treat.
Living their lives
In a pause,
They teach me
How to take a break,
And learn how to walk slow,
To enjoy every moment,
Whether on vacation,
Or at work.
They teach me
To lessen my agendas
To leave behind the past
And let the future rest
To be in the present,
In this here and now.
I learn to sit still,
Immerse myself in the now,
Enjoy my surroundings,
And the words I read;
Stopping for a coffee
Every now and then.

Like Atlas, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, wait staff in Vienna take their job very, very seriously.
Vienna: the capital of Austria, home of the Hasburg dynasty, old architecture and tardy, poker faced, sarcastic wait staff.
In one of Europe’s oldest cities, with a long and rich cultural history, and a reputation as one of the world’s centres of art and learning, the wait staff rule supreme. Long waits for service, being ignored and a general attitude of low level irritation that you want to be a customer seems to be the norm.
Ancient architecture = posh attitude
One travel brochure (The Free Map For Young and Clever People) proclaims that in Vienna, “The waiter is king. Don’t be surprised if the waiters are unfriendly - not the guest is king, he is. Treat him as your superior and he will reward you.” The brochure also claims that “waiters NEVER smile” and that for tipping “5-10% of the bill is the amount the king expects from his subjects.”
The advice in The Free Map for Young And Clever People is ridiculously honest and self-deprecating.
To begin with you are annoyed and maybe offended by this behaviour. But, after a few experiences you realise that it’s not actually you personally the waiter hates, it’s everybody – perhaps it’s a persona they all adopt as part of their profession or as a survival tactic against drunk and obnoxious tourists who don’t speak German.
My personal experiences of this phenomenon were being told I had ordered children’s beer when choosing a 330ml sized glass (normal serving size in my country) instead of a ½ litre. My bad. Another was overhearing the same waiter yell at a patron asking them if they wanted to see a menu. Theoretically, this sounds like he was being helpful and doing his job. However, in person, his tone, body language and glare revealed the true nature of his passive aggressive overture. What he actually said nonverbally was “buy something to eat or f**K off”.
When your office is this plush you might be forgiven for developing an arrogant attitude.
A further experience was when buying a Kaserkrainer (vienesse hotdog) from a street vendor in the early hours of the morning. The vendor must have been earning significantly less than the barman and really needed the customers, but felt the need to finish his entire cigarette before deining to serve us. He then spent less time than it took to smoke it heating a sausage on the grill, before wrapping it and throwing it on the counter for me to collect. The patience we were expected to show while waiting was not reciprocal. While we fumbled uncoordinated and inebriated for the correct change, his bloodshot eyes glared with annoyance. How dare we bother him to prepare his advertised victuals and deign to give him a few euros for his disgruntled efforts.
This attitude is strange considering that you want to spend your money at the establishment where said wait staff are employed. You might think they would be welcoming of a tourist who wants to donate them money. You may highlight the link between your custom and their wages – but you would be wrong. The waiter just has no f**ks to give about you and your desires to eat or drink or be treated like a human being.
“Let them eat cake” - Marie Antionette was a Hasburg and probably developed the attitude that cost her life while growing up in Vienna.
Sometimes this apathy worked in our favour. For example, when the bus driver was in danger of having to do something untoward, such as turn in his seat, converse with you and maybe issue you a ticket. Instead, it was easier for him to just lift his eyes, wave his hand dismissively towards the general direction of the back of the bus and grunt something. We interpreted this as there would be no charge, but it may have meant - “I just don’t give a s**t.” I doubt he would have come to our defence if an undercover ticket check had taken place.
Advice for ‘Acting like a local' — “Be Grumpy”
The Free Map for Young and Clever People makes an effort to explain why the Viennesse hate on life. Under the heading ‘Act like a Local’ it was suggested that you “be grumpy”. Supposedly, it is “mandatory” for “original Vienesse to complain if the bus is one minute late or the weather is too hot/cold/wet/sunny. This “mentality” (general bad attitude) was justified as being part of the rich Vienesse culture and is based on hundreds of years of historical precedent and practice.
Back in the day (16-18th Centuries), Vienna was the home of the Hasburg Dynasty and the centre of several empires. As such it was a center of commerce, education, construction etc, and developed a large bureaucracy which served the monarchy and employed half the population of the city. Everybody knows that a high standard of living, steady employment and job security suck, so it is understandable that these unlucky civil servants developed a negative attitude.
Members of the Hasburg dynasty pretty much ruled most of Europe in the 16th - 18th centuries
According to the Free Map for Young and Clever People this explains why wait staff, and more generally everyone (especially if they had an ancestor who worked for the government) has the historical right to be grumpy, rude or generally a dick.
Other historical facts from the Free Map include how after WWII “all the Nazis miraculously disappear and the population suffers a collective loss of memory as far as the last 7 years are concerned.”
This appeal to history is obviously a bullsh**t excuse to act like a jerk. More likely, people being people, they could not leave their work at work and the hierarchal structure of a feudal bureaucracy permeated into their attitudes and behaviour outside of their jobs. Add a mix of simian tribalism or pack behaviour and next thing everyone is looking down their noses at anyone else their social standing allows them to – and treating them accordingly.
What is mystifying is that in contemporary Vienna, a city where the Arts and Humanities are cultivated, this is a standard of behaviour that some aspire to. Or perhaps it’s as simple as:
“If you don’t like a person, it’s because they remind you of something you don’t like about yourself.” — Sigmund Freud, father of modern psychology and resident of Vienna, before being forced to fleeing prior to WWII.

Vienna, the capital of Austria, stands as a city that seamlessly blends a rich historical legacy, vibrant culture, and a spirit of innovation. It has earned a well-deserved reputation for offering an exceptional quality of life to both its residents and visitors. Notably, Vienna has consistently secured the top spot as the world’s most livable city in esteemed international studies and rankings, such as the Global Livability Index 2022 by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Mercer Quality of Living Survey 2022. But what distinguishes Vienna and enables it to maintain this remarkable achievement for two consecutive years? In this article, we will explore the key factors that contribute to Vienna’s unparalleled livability and unveil the myriad ways in which you can personally immerse yourself in its captivating allure.
Vienna’s public transportation system adds to its allure as an exceptional city to reside in. The city takes pride in its secure and efficient network that not only promotes sustainability and physical well-being but also effectively mitigates traffic congestion. A comprehensive range of buses, trams, trains, and metro lines seamlessly connect every corner of Vienna and its surrounding areas. Moreover, Vienna provides dedicated bike lanes, convenient car-sharing programs, and electric scooters to facilitate eco-friendly mobility options throughout the region.

I decided to ditch the flight mode this time and chose to travel by train for the remainder of my Europe tour. This was the last leg of my 20-day Europe trip, and I had booked train tickets from Vienna to Munich in advance. Yes, it was a great decision.
I had traveled by train in Europe before on several other trips and the experience was stupendous. Notable among them -
Paris to Interlaken in Switzerland
Within Switzerland most of the travel I undertook by train
London to Edinburgh
Rome to Venice
Each form of transport has its advantages and disadvantages. Having different types of travel experiences is worthwhile and we must try them all. It is Fun !!
While trains have a charm of their own, one of the drawbacks is that you have to take care of your luggage and stack them in their proper place. Unlike a flight where your luggage is checked in and taken care of soon after you arrive, making you feel relaxed and free.
On the other hand, to catch a flight, you have to reach the airport at least two hours in advance and go through security, etc, while traveling by train does not involve any of these processes. Hence it is hassle-free and time-saving.
An additional reward of train travel is that you get to enjoy the bewitching countryside views.
Another benefit of train travel is that it is cheaper compared to flights.
Staying in the Ibis hotel directly opposite the railway station in Vienna was so convenient. Firstly, it was a great place to have your meals at the elaborate food court inside the station building. Similar to what we have at malls or airports, you could choose from a wide variety of cuisines.
Secondly, boarding my train to Munich was a breeze. All I had to do was cross the street and within minutes I was at the train station. Though I had the tickets downloaded on my phone, due to unfamiliar language, the platform and the seat numbers were not clear. As such a day prior to my departure, I went and clarified at the information kiosk. The result was that on the travel day everything was smooth sailing.
The railways have done a fantastic job of making train travel incredibly easy and comfortable. I really appreciate the presence of glass waiting lounges (similar to the one at Vienna) at railway stations — a protection for passengers against harsh weather conditions.
Absorbing the last glimpse of the splendors of Vienna, as the train left the platform, the view from the window transformed into staggeringly pretty vistas. The four-and-a-half-hour journey was filled with picture postcard scenery as the high-speed train traversed through verdant countryside landscapes, charming villages, with their cute cottages and historical landmarks.
Amongst the several stoppages en route was the historic town of Salzburg. It was on my bucket list, but was unable to visit. I was quite tempted to get down there and explore, but since there wasn’t any plan or reservations done, so skipped.
In the previous train journeys food was included, and I enjoyed the luxury of being served warm, delicious food and drinks in the cozy comforts of high-speed trains. The in-between snacks were a surprise perk and a great pass time.
This time though the pantry car and availability of food was a let down. Most of the hot, fresh food and beverages were over. There were very limited options left, that too of packaged snacks, that I don’t prefer.
I was craving for a hot chocolate drink and that was over. Something that I relish immensely, not just for its creamy, lip-smacking taste but also the fact that it aided in keeping me warm from the cold weather. Had to settle for the insipid, tasteless tea instead!
It didn’t even seem as if I was traveling from one country to another in Europe, except on crossing the border from Austria to Germany, when uniformed border police personnel were there inside the train for passport checking. I didn’t know about it, luckily had my passports in my handbag and not packed in the suitcase.
From the numerous connecting flights that I took, this was a different experience. A desirable change, rather than flitting in and out of airports. Holidaying at a slow, relaxed pace, that lifted my spirits.

Words by Boris Fishman and Alex HalberstadtPhotographs by Francesca Catastini
THE SLATE-COLORED JANUARY MORNING drummed cold rain against the windows of Café Prückel. My friend Boris and I had arrived on the red-eye from JFK two hours before. He wanted to sleep; I wanted to go to Prückel, and he’d reluctantly agreed.
Vienna is renowned for its cafés. There’s the toothache-inducing gilt of Café Central, the faux-bohemian shabbiness of Café Hawelka, the raspberry-bordello color scheme of Café Sacher. But my first destination in Vienna is always Café Prückel. Like the more central cafés, it, too, is overseen by taciturn middle-aged men in poly-blend tuxedos. (Viennese servers do not subsist on tips, a fact reflected in their unhurried gait and refreshing disinclination to smile.) But it’s more spacious and sparsely populated, always making me feel pleasurably left alone. Multilingual newspapers hang along the walls, and soft-boiled eggs arrive in eggcups alongside good espresso, and the light streaming in through tall windows invites you to dig your shoulders into the upholstery and linger.
Across the table, Boris didn’t seem to share my enthusiasm. But it wasn’t because I’d kept him from a soft mattress. “It’s like a Soviet cafeteria,” he said, poking unhappily at the cold cuts that had arrived along with the eggs. He surveyed the vast dining area, which, admittedly, did have a wood-paneled wall or two. “The bourgeois version.” I suspected that this was partly why I loved it.
I first came to Vienna when I was 9, a refugee fleeing the Soviet Union. My mother, her parents, and I shared a rundown hotel suite somewhere on the city’s edge. It was the first stop on the journey that would eventually take us to New York, and Vienna was our first encounter with what everyone in the Soviet Union referred to, usually in a whisper, as the West.
Beginning in the late ’60s, hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking refugees passed through Vienna on their way west, mainly to Israel and the United States. Concerned about the appearance of losing so many citizens, Soviet officials preferred to release their refugees to an intermediary nation — and its neutrality made Austria a logical choice. I suppose what I remember most about those weeks in 1979 is a peculiar mixture of emotions: sheer confusion; exhilarated discovery; the distinct embarrassment of being a stranger in what felt like a more civilized civilization; and the recent loss of everything and everyone familiar save a handful of loved ones, a presentiment cushioned for me by the fact of my childhood.
But my most indelible memories of Vienna were of café interiors, especially the vitrines filled with pristine geometric pastries that looked to us like they were made by Fabergé — they were all the more compelling because, subsisting on an allowance from a refugee-resettlement agency, we couldn’t afford to taste them. Now, decades later, I could — and did, an architectural piece of strudel surrounded by a moat of vanilla sauce. I was finishing a book about three generations of my family and wanted to find some vestige of our passage, and of my former self. On this, my fifth visit to Vienna in ten years, I wanted to know one more thing: Why did the city pull me to itself so relentlessly?
JANUARY IN VIENNA: I should have known better. But if Alex had proposed the Sahel in August, I probably would have said yes, too. In Alex, I’d finally met, after 29 relatively barren American years, what felt like a doppelgänger. He had experienced the same immigration I had, ten years earlier; it had left him with similar complexes; and he had the same degree of separation from his Russianness and Jewishness that I did.
And I was curious about Vienna. It was where my family and I encountered the West in 1988, when I was 9. No one had told me where we were going or why, but the signs weren’t good. In the months before leaving, as we pawned everything in our apartment and whittled a century in Minsk into one suitcase per person, my sweet, sheltered Soviet life gave way to unspecified terror. (Ordinary people didn’t travel outside the Soviet Union, and those who did certainly never got to return.) On the rail platform of the train to Vienna — it was easier to imagine visiting Mars — my mother wept as if someone had died. Soviet customs had just upended our suitcases and treated itself to my mother’s wedding ring and a set of gold cutlery. My neck burned with a gold necklace concealed under the top button.
Thirty-six hours later, we rolled into a kind of fairy tale. Even poor people seemed to drive Mercedeses. The supermarkets had automatic sliding doors, which my father learned after nearly toppling an emerging Austrian grandma. I gorged on bratwurst oozing with bergkäse cheese and ice cream cylinders wrapped at the ends with striped twine. In this country, the sausages melted like ice cream, and the ice cream came wrapped at the ends like cured sausage! Once, I came across a kitchenware store so beautiful that, my mouth agape, I walked right into the window, my forehead leaving a spot on the glass. We might as well have been rural North Koreans trying to defect to Ibiza. (At our medical checkups, the doctor handed us a diagram that explained that my mother had to consume the pills for her earache orally, not by putting them in her ear, as previous immigrants had been doing in deference to the Soviet habit of treating earaches with ear compresses.) But Vienna — Vienna would do.
Since immigrating, as I Americanized, then de-Americanized to reconnect with my heritage, then pureed both parts of myself into a thoroughly imperfect but more or less livable hash, I thought of Vienna now and then, the way you wonder about what might have been with someone had the timing been better. In places like Austria, I imagined, they didn’t worship “freedom” to the point of anarchy; were less ready to sacrifice morality for profit; did not regard intellectuals with suspicion; and took care of artists — took care of people in general. Alex felt a deeper attachment to our adopted homeland. It was the one part of him that mystified me.
Thirty years earlier, a small number of refugees like us had found a way to remain in Vienna. “What are you all stampeding over there for?” one, named Sasha, kept asking us. He meant America, a word that to us meant more than Shangri-la. Sasha had visited Brooklyn, where we were heading. “What’s it like?” my mother asked. “It’s not like anything,” he said. When we finally encountered it two months later — low-slung, dirty, and gray — we remembered his words. What if I’d spent the last three decades in Vienna, instead? But there’s the fantasy and the cold, gray, wood-paneled truth.
MY FIRST MEMORY OF VIENNA begins aboard an Aeroflot jet, its fuselage painted with a winged hammer and sickle. My mother and I left Moscow in our winter coats, carrying two suitcases containing six changes of clothes, a photo album, and a book of poems by Anna Akhmatova. My mother’s wedding ring and watch were taken in customs. Aboard the plane we were served an unexpectedly luxurious meal of baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and a wedge of soft processed cheese in a foil wrapper that read “Progress!” I remember my mother slipping the metal forks and knives into her coat pockets. An hour into the flight the pilot announced, in German and then in Russian, that the plane had left Soviet airspace. “Meine Damen und Herren…,” the announcement began, and when it was finished one or two passengers, the boldest ones, clapped. At the airport in Vienna, I sat on my suitcase and gaped at a security guard with a German shepherd and a submachine gun. Then I watched a pilot walk out of the gate, his hat embroidered with the six-pointed star of Israel. “Is Austria a capitalist country?” I asked my mother. She said I looked “as scared as a rabbit.”
To revisit a place remembered from childhood is to realize two rather disappointing facts: (1) Most of us recall childhood through a filter of adult sentimentality, and (2) our memories are, at best, undependable — researchers have found that every time we mentally access a memory, our recall of it changes. We confabulate others unwittingly, with a clear conscience. And the more I thought about my weeks in Vienna in the fall of 1979, the more I had to admit that two things had occupied nearly all of my 9-year-old brain: non-Soviet makes of automobiles and eating. Luckily, my interest in cars has waned, but eating remains a preoccupation. The Viennese are preoccupied with it, too, though without the Parisian self-regard or Roman chauvinism.
As in other cities with thriving café cultures, Vienna’s cafés and bars are cognizant of themselves primarily as social spaces. Most are laid out with watching — and being watched — in mind. Some are as flamboyant as stage sets, but all seem attuned to the public pleasures of tribal togetherness or the kind of low-effort nonconformism that sometimes involves an omelet.
Zum Schwarzen Kameel, where Beethoven had emptied a great many cases of red wine, was celebrating its 400th anniversary, and after a long nap to kill jet lag, Boris and I pulled up two hard barstools in its front room. Popular with maximally groomed, rather cruel-looking regulars — it’s a hangout for conservative politicians — it encourages competitive levels of smoking, which remains permitted in restaurants, another vestige of my Soviet past. Kameel is home to one of the country’s most thorough wine cellars and possibly the most rewarding people-watching in town. Boris and I spent a night there drinking cold Grüner Veltliner, happily lost in talk, while men in quilted jackets and creased trousers crowded around the bar, jockeying for another glass of wine. The only solitary figure was an enervated young woman wearing a fox-fur waistcoat and a Chanel bag sitting across from us. She looked like someone had stood her up. She kept her vividly mascaraed eyes fixed in the middle distance and, with jeweled fingers wrapped around her glass, exhaled drafts of smoke in our faces.
I HAD GIVEN ALEX PRÜCKEL, so he agreed to give me “Swimming Pool.” In Mitteleuropa, when it comes to fitness, yoga and spin classes are still the interlopers, and bath complexes the standard. But we didn’t go to the century-old Jörgerbad pool, in the sleepy 17th district, to take the healing waters. I wanted to see whether the comparative generosity of the Austrian state meant better art. For there was going to be art at the pool, commissioned by the nonprofit arts group Brut, a mainstay of the avant-garde scene in Vienna. A performance artist and several confederates were going to use the pool to “expos[e] the audience to the conflicting feelings of safety and uncanniness.” Whatever that meant.
After some horsing around in the pool, the actors went off to perform various oddities. One poured what looked like red food dye into the pool gutter, making me think of chemical attacks and the extreme generosity of Austrian arts funding. (Alex deemed it “quixotic and bad.”) At home, thanks to our new president, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts — the equivalent of two and a half F-15s — was under the knife.
I had become a full-time freelance writer at 24, and it’s possible that I didn’t sleep or eat for the next year or two — I was too terrified for my future. After a year of 16-hour days and seven-day weeks, I had $22,000, a twitching left eyelid, and not one article I could point to as the product of passion instead of expedience. As bizarre as it was, “Swimming Pool” — or the reality that had made it possible — felt quite okay as an alternative. Everyone in attendance was young, attractive, and responsible — the invitation had said to bring one’s own flip-flops, and everyone had. And serious: They gazed upon the circus before us with the utmost solemnity.
After the performance, we ended up at Rebhuhn, a traditional tavern just outside the city center. It served a Platonic version of grandmother food — pike-perch in a white-wine-but-mostly-butter sauce, chestnut “pasta” over cream and lingonberry preserves — but the best thing about Rebhuhn wasn’t the food. At one table, a woman was reading a newspaper. At another, three lavishly dressed women were having what you just knew was their every-Sunday-night klatch. There were 20-somethings and 80-somethings. No one was “doing a concept” to “maximize covers,” no one was trying to pretend to touch my soul so they could scour my wallet.
When I ate out at such a place in New York, I felt guilty for lingering because I was infringing on the server’s opportunity to turn the table, something I felt responsible for because American restaurants didn’t pay their servers a living wage. Nowhere did this economic model feel as insane as at Rebhuhn in Vienna on a Sunday evening. “Vienna,” Alex said in another theft-worthy line as he mopped sauce with a cube of fish, “is cultural Xanax.” In America, I realized, we were undergoing a kind of national seizure, the kind where you’d stopped noticing that your shoulders were up all the time because you’d internalized terrible economic insecurity as the norm. Safety — an uncanny feeling, indeed. Perhaps the Europe I’d been imagining — the Vienna Alex had been telling me about almost since we’d met — wasn’t only a fantasy.
ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE CITY that saturated my childhood imagination: the streets themselves. After growing up in one of the Brezhnev-era apartment towers that surrounded Moscow like a cinder-block forest, Vienna struck me as a marvel from a distant antiquity. In fact, the city was transformed in the 19th century by Emperor Franz Joseph I, and it is his Vienna — neo-Baroque, orderly, martial — that visitors see today. Franz Joseph’s vision lent the city the quality that has stayed with me most as an adult, a quality that no amount of skyscrapers can efface — an officious, comforting solemnity.
It was just off one of these imperial streets that Boris and I spent our most educational outing in Vienna — at Gasthaus Grünauer, a partly hidden local institution with an interior so low-ceilinged and rustic that it could’ve been located in Middle-earth. We were meeting my friends. Jutta Ambrositsch is the city’s most talented winemaker; her husband, Marco, operates the business side of the winery. The restaurant’s third-generation proprietor, Christian Grünauer, owner of one of the most sardonic faces I’d seen, reminisced in unaccented English about 1980s New York, where he waited tables at an Upper East Side Italian restaurant called Elio’s. One of the regulars there was Donald Trump. “He was so afraid of germs that he wouldn’t shake anyone’s hand,” Christian recalled, “but look at him now, slapping backs and kissing babies!”
Christian’s wife, Katja, prepared Mitteleuropean soul food — grilled veal kidneys, delicately breaded loin of pork, pan-fried whole trout — so flavorful it nearly made us forget about the virtual absence of vegetables. The scene got an infusion of chaos and originality with an appearance of a 60-something gent named Xandi: pear-shaped, red-nosed, leering, perversely avuncular. According to Marco, he was famous around town for his copious eating and drinking, and was rumored to be the father or guardian of 13 children. He waded around our table kissing everyone ceremoniously and wetly and doffing an imaginary hat, then sat down among us, uninvited. He proceeded to deliver a theatrical speech to Jutta that I failed to understand fully due to my meager German, but judging by the suddenly tense faces around the table, its content must have been cutting if not downright mean.
Xandi was demonstrating Wiener Schmäh, a local strain of humor distinguished by dark absurdity, glee at your friends’ misfortune, and masking insult with flattery. When I asked Marco about it later, he shrugged and said, “In Vienna, no joke is too insulting.” I knew what he meant. Back in Brooklyn, Xandi’s behavior would have caused my American-born friends to lapse into embarrassed silence. But at my Russian-Jewish family’s dinner table, an imaginative verbal jab is met with laughter and a grudging appreciation of the offender’s wit — and so it was at Grünauer. No wonder I felt at home.
FROM OUR SIX-HOUR MARATHON of eating, drinking, and smoking, the next morning I remembered only one thing, breathed into my ear by an older gentleman of uncertain employment but many opinions. (This was Xandi, Alex told me later.) “You know why Vienna is perfect?” he said. “It’s 10 to 20 years more slow than everywhere else.” He slapped his doughy hands together, dropping a good bit of cigarette ash onto my jeans. “No complications.”
(I may have remembered only this because, irresponsibly, I didn’t take out my reporter’s notebook all night. Alex and I were very different kinds of travel writers, it turned out — I wrote down everything, and he often waited to see what stuck in his mind. I had decided to try it his way.)
How had we gotten to a world where this was true? Where the best places in Europe were economic B-listers (Portugal, Spain) and those behind the curve (Austria)? This had its downsides. Austria had some of the most progressive social-welfare policies in the world, but you could still smoke in bars and restaurants, and it would be wrong to say Viennese dining had completely left the Wiener schnitzel behind. (Changes were coming to the safety net, too — several weeks before we arrived, a center-right/radical-right coalition had taken power promising to slash social benefits.)
Also, the state extended cultural funding more readily to established artistic institutions than independent artists, which meant that the dynamism and dislocation created by upstart projects often found an easier home elsewhere. Vienna felt less international than almost any Western European capital I’d visited, and almost no one in it seemed to resemble — in dress, habit, conversational references — the globalized elite. This cultural concentrate created a heady unpredictability — the cost, perhaps, of visiting a place like itself and no other. Prückel, “Swimming Pool,” Rebhuhn, Xandi: Even when mediocre, these experiences felt gloriously unrepeatable elsewhere.
GOING OVER THAT NIGHT THE FOLLOWING MORNING, a last scene came into focus: We were at Café Anzengruber, a spot popular with writers and insomniacs, operated by members of a large Croatian clan. Xandi and a pair of young chefs soon appeared. The owner, Tomi, seemed occupied mostly with taunting his defeated-looking brother-in-law, who kept to himself behind the bar. Tomi brought bottles of Croatian Graševina and schnapps and God knows what else and sat down at the table, toasting extravagantly, and soon we were staggeringly drunk. All of us, that is, except Jutta — she sat grinning shyly and a little remorsefully among seven unlaced, hammered men. Something about her expression brought me back to a scene in my childhood kitchen, where my father and four of his friends shared loud, vodka-lubricated enthusiasms about Levi’s jeans and Edgar Winter records, with my mother functioning as the scene’s unmoving, silent axis.
Later, when I related this memory to Julya Rabinowich, one of the country’s best-known authors, she let out an exasperated guffaw. “When it comes to gender equality, Austria is 50 years behind Germany or France,” she said. Despite being a liberal stronghold, Vienna didn’t provide enough day care to meet public demand, Rabinowich explained, forcing many young mothers to stay at home. As in the country of my birth, all too many men here still expected women to handle the majority of the cooking and child care. I was realizing that, culturally, Vienna shared nearly as much with Warsaw-Pact Eastern Europe as it did with the Western democracies. I found much of that kinship problematic, but I couldn’t deny that for me it made Vienna feel as familiar and comfortable as an old blazer. At last, I was deciphering what drew me to this city: It offered much of the essence and manners of my homeland, amid the relative safety and freedom of my home.
In Rabinowich I found something like a double, whose life diverged from mine in ways that interested me. We were born several months apart; her family immigrated from the Soviet Union two years before mine did, but chose to settle in Vienna. I told Rabinowich that, after arriving as a child in New York, I’d felt almost instantly American. “When I was going to school here, no one allowed me to forget I was a foreigner,” she replied. “On the other hand, the government paid for my education, awarded me a stipend that allowed me to write full time, and honored my books with prizes.” We were drinking coffee in a quiet, pretty café in the city’s third district, where everyone seemed to know her by name. Rabinowich, who writes a newspaper column about politics, lamented that the recent election represented “a sharp turn to the right.” She sighed. “But of course I consider myself an Austrian,” she said. “If I leave, I’ll be in exile.”
FOR ALL THE SINCERITY OF MY SEARCHING, there was very little of 1988 Vienna left to discover. Forced to remain neutral as a condition of Soviet withdrawal after the war, Austria didn’t fully accede to the European Union until the mid-1990s. “When I went to Germany in the ’80s, I carried such lists of things to buy that my German friends would jokingly ask me if I wasn’t coming from East Germany rather than Austria,” as one person told me. But once Austria joined the EU, it didn’t look back. The modest pension where my family had stayed seemed to no longer exist, and the street where it was supposedly located listed no store of kitchen supplies.
So it felt like a miracle when it turned out that the two refugee-aid agencies that had shepherded us to America, the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), had representatives in Vienna that had been around for the great Soviet-refugee influx 30 years earlier. (Both agencies continue to serve refugee populations.) Alex and I met them for coffee at Café Frauenhuber, a tourist-district café that miraculously few tourists seem to know about. (Mozart had given his last public performance upstairs, in 1791. Vienna is like that.) And all of a sudden, I was sitting in front of two men whom I very well may have had already met, half a lifetime before.
“I had no time to go to the washroom,” Walter Juraschek, who was with HIAS, said. The child of World War II Polish refugees, he had been made for the work, and began his days at 3 a.m., coaching atheist Soviet people like my parents and grandparents on how to say the right things about Jewish identity to the American consular officers. (Religious persecution was a precondition for refugee status.) HIAS shared an office with the JDC, and Juraschek remembers the waiting rooms and corridors so packed that muscling his way back and forth to his desk proved a daily challenge. He ran interference with the authorities, such as the police officer who had his arm broken by an iron-swinging woman who thought he was coming to arrest her. When the Danish Embassy turned away a Soviet refugee who hoped to emigrate there, Juraschek bombarded the queen of Denmark with letters until she personally intervened.
Inspired by the meeting, I strayed toward the spot on the map that showed the location of the Stadttempel, the main synagogue in Vienna, located in a warren of streets known as the Bermuda Triangle. During my family’s stay in 1988, we’d been taken by the JDC to get a glimpse of the exterior, as holiday services were in progress inside. My grandfather had not come all that way to look at a facade, so he grabbed my hand, split off from the group, and, me at his waist (I still remember the naphthalene smell of his slacks), prised open the heavy wood door. Inside, we saw something we’d never seen in our atheist homeland: Orthodox Jewish men praying. “Fanatics!” he said, not without affection, and winked at me.
True to the promise of the Bermuda Triangle, there was nothing but the backside of an ornate building where the map said the synagogue would be. It didn’t seem like I was meant to find even this — something that definitely still existed. But then, wandering up a side street, I saw it. Or rather the police van that, sadly, so often signals a Jewish place of worship in Europe these days. Who knew if those were the same wood doors my grandfather and I had touched, but their location was the same. As I stood alone in that alley, not wanting to approach them for fear of my intentions being mistaken — I look Middle Eastern — what I was seeing would have to be good enough. And what I was feeling — my grandfather had passed away a month before I’d arrived in Vienna.
ON THE MORNING AFTER the euphoric, drunken night at Grünauer, Jutta drove Boris and me to see her vineyards on the city’s northernmost edge. As we were getting into her Audi, a Japanese tour group emerged from the U-Bahn station nearby, and a woman in a pantsuit leading the tour suddenly shrieked, “Jutta Ambrositsch!” She introduced us excitedly to the group in rapid-fire Japanese. The tourists reacted to this by surrounding us and bursting into applause.
It was an unseasonably cold, foggy day, and Boris and I ended up tramping through muddy vineyards behind Jutta and her elderly fox terrier, Edgar. The view made up for the mud. Standing among the vines on a hill called Nussberg, we looked out over downtown Vienna, anchored by the jutting, silly Millennium Tower, and finally got a sense of the Danube’s massive span. Yet the city was inaudible — we heard only birds. “I live in the city center and I’m a 20-minute drive from the vineyards,” Jutta marveled, pulling a patched hunting jacket tighter around her. “Where else can you do that?”
As a respite from the cold fog and my hurricane-grade hangover, I went to the Kunsthistorisches Museum to see the Bruegels. I spent a long while in the picture gallery on the second floor, looking at ten large panels. Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s village landscapes refuse to be read as religious allegory and exist as documents of rural communities. Their portrayal of the Flemish villagers is neither humorous nor moralizing nor idealistic; instead, they’re suffused with an acceptance of the cycles of daily life — with their 16th-century miseries intact — and a compassion that borders on the post-human.
I stood in front of Hunters in the Snow and remembered the feeling of first seeing it as a 9-year-old. I could picture myself standing beside my mother in that gallery nearly 40 years earlier; the memory was as detailed as though it had happened last week. Later I sat down at a café amid the museum’s imperial-chocolate-cake decor and ordered coffee and a piece of strudel. Then I called my mother in New York. I told her excitedly where I was, and described what I remembered. She listened patiently. “The admission to that museum was expensive,” she said finally. “So we didn’t go. What you remember never happened.”
ON THE BROKEN-HEADED MORNING after our bacchanal, what Vienna calls coffee — an espresso shot lost in a trough of milk and foam — was not going to suffice. I needed rocket fuel, and, feeling morning-after shame of a different kind, headed for the only solution I could imagine: a Starbucks. There, I did something I’ve never done even in America: I ordered a venti. It was only five minutes back to my rental, but it was five minutes longer than necessary to register the horrified stares of rush-hour Vienna at the RPG in my hands.
In the weeks to come, after Alex and I returned to New York, it would be this moment I’d remember more than any other from the trip, crystals of nostalgia forming almost in real time. But no matter how sweet and less mixed my recollections of Vienna became, the feeling never alchemized into a readiness to consider moving there — or anywhere. Having spent so many years looking toward Europe with longing, I’d failed to register just how American I was becoming — if not always ideologically, then due simply to years of being able to order mediocre coffee in three sizes. It isn’t that you can’t go home again. It’s that once you’ve lost it, every place is just what another place isn’t.
That morning, our last, Alex’s friend Jutta was driving us to the 19th district, a posh enclave on the edge of the city that dead-ends in acres of vineyards, including her own. Afterward, at lunch, I told her about my Vienna history. When I mentioned the kitchenware store I’d walked into, she lit up. “It’s called Ostovics!” she said. “There’s one right near Neubaugasse,” the street where I’d told her our pension may have been located. Memory is as vague as it is rigid. It hadn’t occurred to me that the kitchenware store might be on a nearby street.
I had an interview after lunch, but I raced to Ostovics afterward. I remembered floor-to-ceiling windows rather than its glass recessed in a brick enclosure. But the pots and serving dishes behind the glass were painted as beautifully as artworks and actually lived up to the gleam in my memory. I looked around — no one. I’d been feeling regret that I’d not gone up to touch the synagogue doors. (How observantly Jewish, ironically, my investment of that touch with such talismanic power.) So I went up to the Ostovics window and, feeling like a lunatic, brought my forehead to it, like all those years ago. It was cold and dry outside, and the touch left no trace.

Vienna is well known for its high proportion of social housing. Nowadays most sources seem to estimate that around 25% of people living in the city live in some form of municipal housing. It’s evident as you walk around the city. You cannot walk along a street without coming across a housing block with the very recognisable sign outside the entrance. And with the city celebrating it’s 100th year since the first ‘Gemeindebau’ it’s also inescapable in every exhibition about the city’s history.
Housing is an essential component of any city. And with my background working at one of London’s largest housing design practices, I might be biased, but I didn’t think I could come to Vienna to understand how they are approaching gender equitable design without understanding how the city’s housing works.
The existing centre of Vienna is dense, typically made up of courtyard block typologies. So there are limited opportunities for new housing development. The city has a fairly rigid zoning style ‘building code’, which not only sets out built parameters for building lines at the front and back, as well as heights, but also sets out what land uses are allowed on a block by block basis. This has meant that an increasingly popular form of development in the centre is rooftop extensions, as in most areas only a single storey can be added.
In the centre the majority of housing is comprised of flats. It’s not until you get quite far out that you start encountering detached homes. In the older part of town the flats often have unique layouts as they do away with the traditional arrangement of rooms coming off of a hallway, and instead the rooms themselves act as circulation space. This leads to quite space efficient apartments, even if there are some quirks — such as entering the kitchen through the bathroom! Often this comes about through separate apartments having been combined together to create a more spacious home. This also leads to difficulties with living rooms being above bedrooms and vice versa. The other thing that’s worth noting is that many apartments in Vienna in the old town do not have balconies. But as the flats have tall and lofty rooms you don’t miss this so much.
In Red Vienna the city was really reconceptualising how to design for how people wanted to live. The aim was to provide affordable homes of good quality for broad sectors of the population. The housing provided people with light, fresh air and sunshine, as well as nurseries, schools, lending libraries and other communal facilities like laundry rooms. And with more free time they had to organise their lives differently, and the architecture followed suit too — with more space allowed for leisure too. The kitchen became a different kind of space — often with other functions combined with this space, turning it from a purely functional space to one to dwell in. The focus on the evolving role of the kitchen in the home, at the time, ensured that the needs of all genders were taken into consideration and advanced and adapted to new social norms.
Whilst the social principles from which Red Vienna emerged are not necessarily explicitly evident as you walk around the city, many of the ideals still undoubtedly influence and inform the shape of the city and its housing that you see today. And the legacy of the city’s municipal housing undoubtedly has an influence on the shape of its future housing.
Earlier this year I was awarded the RTPI George Pepler Award by the RTPI. The George Pepler Award is a bursary granted to a person in their first 10 years post qualification experience wishing to undertake a short period of study on a particular aspect of spatial planning. I was delighted to win the opportunity to carry out my research proposal entitled ‘What can the UK learn from Vienna with regards to adopting a gender mainstreaming approach to shape built outcomes?’ I am currently in Vienna for researching how Vienna has made itself more Gender Equal. #GenderEqualCities

The background to my being in Austria in the first place: family. My parents were immigrants to the United States where I was born and grew up. They returned to their home country at some point, which I wasn’t happy about. Long story short: My relationship with this city is ambivalent. I hated it when we first arrived from sunny southern California. It was a completely different world. Over the years, things have changed and a certain cool factor exists plus I love classical music so it’s not the worst place to be spending time.
Here are some cool and weird facts about Vienna along with some of my experiences. Some apply to Austria. Other odd factoids are typically Viennese you won’t find anywhere else.

Despite its size, Austria’s capital has the feel of a large town. According to global rankings, Vienna is one of the most livable cities in the world. Because of excellent public services, economic success, and low crime rates. At the time of writing, Vienna had been named the world’s unfriendliest city. Don’t you think it’s a bit contentious?
Here are some useful hints and details about Vienna, Austria, as well as driving directions. We can say that getting around Vienna is a breeze.
The city is divided into 23 districts. A neighborhood that surrounds the “Ringstraße” — Ring street.
By simply walking down this street, you can see many sights in Vienna.In the past, fortifications guarding the city stood where Ringstraße now stands.
Austrians frequently refer to districts by their numbers. “I live in the first!” or “I have to travel to the tenth tomorrow!” you might hear. Isn’t that not at all Germans?
You can tell which district you are in by looking at the number on the street name sign.

With the greatest of delights I just realised something: all my life, I have been living in Red Cities — cities with a Socialist history. All the cities I loved and lived in — Ghent in Belgium, Jerusalem in Israel, Firenze in Italy, and now Vienna — were, and sometimes still are, fiery red, and proud of it.
I have been in Vienna for nearly fifteen years now, and I have gradually discovered a place and a history that traditional travel guides won’t tell you much about. Yet this Rotes Wien is visible everywhere, in every district you visit and on nearly every street you walk through.

It’s hard to believe I’ve in Vienna over a year. As 2023 closes, I wanted to recap my experiences here over the last 15 months or so.
The Apartment I am so glad I decided on an apartment closer to the center and not closer to work. Though we do have hybrid work, our office is on the edge of Vienna heading west. Living close to the center gives me a huge number of options for food, shopping and culture. I can walk to the center of Vienna in about 25 minutes. The area I live in is one of the best areas in Vienna for shopping, food and the main museums are close by (District 6: Mariahilf).  Altogether Vienna is truly a great place to live. It was again voted world’s most livable city this year.
The Culture & The Food There is so much to see and do here. And I’ve seen many museums, cafés, restaurants, parks and more. Yet I still feel almost overwhelmed with choices. Here are some of my favorites:
My favorites museums are: Art History Museum (center, gorgeous building), the World Museum (center), and the Klimt Villa (which is a mansion built over Gustav Klimt’s original workspace; it has a lovely…

“Are we being good ancestors?”. This was the question posed by the American virologist Jonas Salk in 1955, after developing the first effective vaccine against polio. He refused to patent the vaccine, missing out on millions in earnings, believing that the best way to become a good ancestor was to give it away to anyone who needed it.
Long-term thinking, and becoming a good ancestor, does not come naturally to humanity. Corporate executives are flustered about quarterly reports, and seek the dopamine hit of immediate growth rather than implementing a long-term strategy. Political leaders focus on the next set of parliamentary elections, rather than worry about long-term issues, such as the climate crisis or sustainable development. Far too often, we are consumed by the “tyranny of now”, rather than the “power of yet”, to use Carol Dweck’s phrase.
We see this in Ireland, and its attitude to housing. Last year, there was a lot of chat in the media about the €750 tax credit for renters, announced in the last budget. I appreciate this, but it does nothing to address the real problem — lack of supply. Everybody in this country, except possibly legislators in the Dáil, knows that there is an acute shortage of housing here.
No tax credit ever built a house or an apartment. It also means nothing to the person that can’t find a property to rent in Dublin or Cork. This example of the “tyranny of now”, which the coalition government may be using to gain voters for next year’s general election, needs to be replaced with a longer-term strategy, the “power of yet”. One city provides an example of such a strategy.
In this essay, I discuss Vienna, a city that used the “power of yet” to fix a housing crisis 100 years ago. Immigration exacerbated the city’s housing shortage, leaving hundreds of thousands of Viennese living without running water or toilet facilities. I will tell you about “Red Vienna”, and how a left-wing municipal government built a “Ring Road of the Proletariat”, without creating crime-ridden communities. I will also show you how this legacy endures today — today, Vienna is the most liveable city in the world. Viennese policymakers from 100 years ago are rightly remembered as good ancestors; Irish policymakers could be as well.

Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the First World War, Vienna, then home to 2 million people, found itself in a desperate situation. Wartime rationing and inflation had left middle-class professionals and businessowners on the brink of starvation and vulnerable to infectious diseases. Vienna, once the sparkling capital of a multi-ethnic empire, home to Croats, Slovenes, Czechs, Poles, and of course Austrians and Hungarians, was now an overcrowded city within a war-ravaged state. The treaty of Saint-Germain, signed in 1919, explicitly forbade the new German-speaking republic from unifying with Germany, enraging socialists and nationalists alike.
Vienna, now home to 28% of the population of the newly established Republic of Austria, lacked basic amenities, such as food and clothing, largely due to trade embargos imposed on it by the Triple Entente. Hyperinflation rendered War Bonds worthless, eliminating the savings of the middle and upper classes. Supply chains to Vienna from its empire were cut off by the existence of new borders, making the supply of food even more difficult. Communists and fascists in the city stirred up working-class grievances, leading to strikes and political violence.
Just as we see in the English-speaking world today, Vienna had a chronic shortage of affordable housing. Over 250,000 Viennese workers lived in small apartment blocks, known as “Bassena”, with no access to running water. Many of Vienna’s “Bettgeher” (“bed lodgers”) lived in rent-by-the-room accommodations, in which residents could only sleep in their beds for half of the day, effectively sleeping in shifts. These units lacked windows or toilet facilities, depriving renters of cleanliness and sunlight. The units weren’t even cheap; a 2022 study from MIT calculated that rent could cost up to 25% of a family’s income. These unsanitary yet expensive homes remind me of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old child who died from exposure to mould in a flat in Rochdale in England last year.
Like Ireland today, Vienna’s housing shortage came in response to an influx of immigrants. Between 1880 and 1910, its total number of inhabitants jumped from 726,000 to over 2 million, placing it on a par with Paris and Berlin. For instance, Jewish immigrants, granted full citizenship by the Empire in 1867, flocked to the city from Hungary, Moravia and Galicia. The names of the new arrivals read like a who’s who of fin-de-siècle European intellectual life: Sigmund Freud was born in Moravia, before moving to the city with his family when he was four years old. Theodor Herzl, the founder of the modern Zionist movement, was born in Budapest, before arriving in Vienna to study law.
3.
In 1919, the city held its Gemeinderat (Municipal Elections), electing as its mayor the socialist Jakob Reumann. Reumann, a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria (SDAP), made the then-innovative decision to build 25,000 units subsided public housing for Austrian workers, financed by progressive taxes on land and luxury goods, such as champagne and cars. About 40 percent of the costs of building the houses came from taxes on upper-class properties. From 1919 to 1933, the city council was the only entity that built new homes.
In 1927, construction began on Karl-Marx-Hof (literally “Karl Marx Court”). Finished in 1930, it was designed by Karl Ehn, an architect and socialist who apprenticed under Otto Wagner, a native of Vienna, and founder of the Art Nouveau architectural movement. The Karl-Marx-Hof consisted of green spaces, play areas and amenities such as a pharmacy and a post office. Comprised of 1,382 apartments, and designed for a population of about 5,000, it spanned about 1.2 kilometres in length, making it the longest single residential buildings in the world. Other hofe, such as Engelshof, Bebelhof, and George-Washington-Hof, emerged during the same period. Public baths like the Amalienbad, opened in 1926, provided proper sanitation for lower-class Viennese, as well as a safe place to socialise.
Just as NIMBYists (not-in-my-back-yard) today warn that increasing the supply of social housing will create a new generation of “school dropouts, drug users, non-workers and criminals”, there was a moral panic around the provision of housing in Vienna too. The taxes needed to finance their construction were viciously opposed by “Black Vienna”, which consisted of conservative landowners and leaders, monarchists, anti-Semites and Catholic radicals. They whined about “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”, potentially effective dog whistles in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
As noted previously, the planners of “Red Vienna” were followers of Otto Wagner and his Art Nouveau movement. The Art Nouveau style, used to design Viennese buildings such as the Majolica House and the Secession Building, used intricate patterns, curving lines, and the use of materials like glass, ceramics and iron. Using similarly elaborate patterns helped to make the new apartment blocks, spanning the “Ring Road of the Proletariat” on Margaretengurtel in southern Vienna, look like upper-class dwellings. Harvard historian Eve Blau sums up the pragmatic case for beautiful social houses thus: “If you’re planning something radical, it’s not a bad idea to come across as conservative as possible”.
4.
By 1934, the Viennese city council had built about 64,000 apartments, which housed 10% of the city’s population. Like the Karl-Marx-Hof, these too were equipped with everyday amenities. As well as the city’s progressive tax system, this impressive rate of construction was assisted by the city council’s intelligent use of rent controls. First implemented in 1922, rent controls initially disincentivised the private development of private buildings, reducing the price of urban land. The council could then purchase the land at the discounted price and create jobs by building on it.
“Red Vienna” would be suspended in 1934, following the establishment of the Standestaat, a one-party fascist state rendered paranoid by the perceived evils of “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”. Between 1938 and 1945, the country would be occupied by the Nazis, led of course by a genocidal Austrian corporal with a silly moustache. After the war, which left over 20% of the city’s housing stock partially or completely destroyed, the Social Democrats regained power, and “Red Vienna” returned with a vengeance. Projects such as the Per-Albin-Hansson-Siedlung in Favoriten, home to 14,000 residents, came into being. In 1969, Vienna constructed its 100,000th new home since the end of Nazi rule.
Today, over 60% of Vienna’s 1.8 million people live in subsidized housing. Local authorities own and manage about 220,000 housing units, about one-quarter of the city’s total housing stock, and indirectly controls 200,000 units that are owned by private-developers but governed by a city-regulated process. In 1984, the city set up a “Land Procurement and Urban Renewal Fund” that reserves land in the city for affordable homes and amenities — as of 2019, the fund owned over 3 million square metres of land. In 2018, the city passed legislation, requiring that for all housing projects with over 5,000 square metres of space, at least two thirds of the new builds must be subsided. Recent projects include the 850-apartment Wohnpark Neue Donau and the 1,004-unit Kabelwerk estate.
5.
The positive consequences of Vienna’s commitment to housing development are obvious. A 2023 report shows that average rents are just over a quarter those of European cities such as Paris and Oslo. Figures for monthly rents, which by law cannot be more than 25% of a tenant’s income, are often as low as €500 or €600, less than one-third those of Dublin, and can even fall as low as €250 for long-term residents.
It should therefore come as little surprise that Vienna has been selected as the most liveable city in the world in eight of the past ten years by the Economist, including last year. For context, London ranks 34th and Dublin comes in at 37th. This survey takes each city’s accessibility, healthcare, infrastructure and culture into account, and is a testament to the enduring legacy of “Red Vienna” and the “power of yet”.
6.
In this essay, I have described “Red Vienna”, and how it demonstrates the significance of long-term thinking. I have shown you how a formerly impoverished place became the most liveable city on Earth. It is not as if the “power of yet” is entirely foreign to Ireland — in the 1920s, the German company Siemens built the Ardnacrusha Generating Station in County Clare, a project that required almost one-fifth of the Free State’s entire annual budget. The new power station harnessed the waters of the river Shannon to generate about 96% of Ireland’s electricity requirements. The State was poor back then. Now it is estimated that the country will have a €65.2 billion budget surplus by 2027; a pot of gold from foreign multinationals. Let us be good ancestors and spend it.

For the first time in a long time,
I feel like myself again.
Not the version I had to shrink to be loved,
not the one who stayed quiet to keep the peace,
not the girl who called the bare minimum “enough.”
She walked through hell,
but I left her there —
with the people who fed off her silence
and mistook her kindness for weakness.
Now, I’m done explaining,
done waiting to be chosen,
done carrying weight that was never mine.
I’ve never felt so *light.*
There’s sunlight in my bones again,
a laugh I don’t have to fake,
and dreams I’m finally letting breathe.
Next week: Florida.
Me and my friends, chasing the sun,
singing too loud, dancing barefoot,
and soaking in every golden hour like it’s a promise.
Then — Europe.
A one-way ticket and no return date.
No plan but joy.
No map but instinct.
I want to get lost on purpose.
To fall in love with places, moments, and maybe even myself again.
To write my story across coastlines and cafés,
with no one’s voice in my head but mine.
This summer isn’t an escape —
it’s a return.
To who I was before the noise.
To who I’ve *always* been, underneath the wreckage.
And this time,
I’m not just moving on —
I’m moving *up.*
Unapologetically.
Unstoppably.
Unforgettably.
With love (and finally, freedom),
**Me**

Vienna, Austria’s main city, calls out to those wanting to travel, really showing off a sweet mix of old-time class and super current appeal. As you map out what you might do in 2025, check out what makes Vienna a spot you should make time for.
One solid reason why peeps head to Vienna, very, is because of its old buildings and totally awesome design work. From the flashy Schönbrunn Palace to the grand St. Stephen’s Cathedral with its super old style, Vienna’s loaded with famous spots showing off its super rich past. Each spot there, kind of tells stories from when the city had kings and queens, providing like, a little look into royal stories.
link: Scope out what Vienna’s made of with places on tours!
Vienna acts as a big spot for what’s hip, playing host to worldwide museums and places for checking out cool art. The Kunsthistorisches Museum with the Albertina Museum bring master art into the frame, and the MuseumsQuartier provides modern pieces, too it’s almost, all different walks of creative styles that can get a gaze out of Vienna.
link: Witness Vienna’s dope artistry on superb gallery hopping excursions!
Past, its charming things from times of yore, that stuns people getting around to nice areas with plant life included such as parks and yards to sit in Vienna. That location made out to hold, just a short trip, and get people walking there or doing picnics like the Schönbrunn Palace Gardens or Stadtpark are kind of there.
link: Tour open field getaways in Vienna on foot!
Food wise, it gives all people a taste which provides variety such as traditional eats meets modern, since there’s super yummy places for treats; such as drinks plus fancier restaurant place options where each mouthful has stories in Vienna.
link: Taste foods cooked in tours that focus mainly just around chow in Vienna!
Vienna’s yearly stuff gives all types plus times available that’s quite like music events and showing opera which, very, brings like magical audio feel throughout iconic venue zones so check the beats or how people display traditions there as a option to do that might seem very entertaining during your vacation
link: Jam at music events out playing while you come travel over toward Vienna!
That city greets everyone really nice but provides current zones while exploring to go inside which help feel special such as hotels which look cool when peeking high over streets down beneath all luxury types providing special districts from before. Vienna tries hard at trying its best Austrian feel since they know modern needs seem key plus a vacation needs memorable service for visits to local territory, too it’s almost, each tourist wants this place at some parts throughout whenever being close from them as places around Vienna have lots, and loads, to tell too!
link: Come across those high scores by other folk where lodging happens inside!
The blending mix throughout that zone means you visit history, culture that feel fairly home-y or super out of this ordinary during adventures!
There are tons like safety type precautions set cause most see not that high dangers as they get vacation feel in locations.
Early in warmth (say start near Apr thru towards almost June), that gives mild breeze over those periods if avoid large mass cause tourist traffic, while that nice feels could occur anytime during each moment when season turns later round later times within twelve moths overall .
link: Craft ideas for that perfect escape for what’s from Vienna using information around others holidays planned there already!!

I woke up this morning at dawn…I wasn’t quite sure where I was until I opened the window. The sun was rising in the horizon and it clicked: “Vienna!”
I had always dreamed of Vienna as this elegant and majestuous city, home of Sisi the Empress and fairy tales my mum used to read me in bed. I remember the history books in high school with pictures of the Austro-Hungarian Empire portraying royal families and castles. The heart of Europe.
I left my hotel not knowing exactly where I was headed to; all I wanted was to travel back in time, wander through history, let the city surprise me and instinct be my guide.
As I approached the centre, the magic started to unfold: majestic buildings like the Parliament, the Museum…I walked through a manicured garden that led me straight into the statue of Mozart. It reminded me that Vienna is The City Of Music, home to Beethoven and Schubert and I can understand where they got the inspiration to…

…Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role…
We had the pleasure of interviewing Martina Huemann. Martina is Professor at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business where she heads the Project Management Group in the Department Strategy and Innovation and is the Academic Director of the Professional MBA Program: Project Management. She has published widely in the fields of Project Management and Human Resource Management. For her Research on Human Resource management in Project-oriented Organisations, she received the IPMA Research Award 2015.
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path?
Born in Vienna, Austria I am currently living between Vienna and London. While in Vienna I am Academic Director of the Vienna Executive MBA: Strategic Project Management and lead the Project Management Group in the Institute of Strategic Management at WU Vienna. For 1,5 years I am a Full Professor of Project Leadership and Society at University College London, Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction.
I am Editor-in Chief of International Journal of Project Management, the leading journal in Project Research and Founding Editor-in-Chief of Project Leadership and Society and hold several board positions in national and international Associations.
I have two children, two boys, one born 1997 and one born 2005.
Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
My career was probably not expected from me. As I was the first one in my family who made it to university. My parents came from a simple background, my mother was educated as a tailor but run a small shop and my father was a warehouse worker for a newspaper. While both not having much formal education, they always gave me the feeling that I can achieve everything what I want.
I also did my studies at WU Vienna and when I entered the building I felt not belonging there, more an alien. I had no role models in my family. However, I decided that I wanted to get more knowledge and a formal education. I studied Business Administration. During the weekends Friday to Sunday night, I worked 20 hours plus in an ice cream shop to contribute to financing my life.
I always having a drive for learning, getting to know something new, but also for visiting other countries and traveling. I am a quite curious person interested in understanding different subjects and contexts, meeting new people and making a difference.
During my studies I spent one semester in Prague and later one semester in Lund Sweden. I was travelling and had the opportunity to engage in different projects, one of those was an EU funded project bringing Didactics to Middle and Eastern Europe countries like Poland, Tech Republic and Slovakia. I was engaged there as a student evaluator. Looking back this got me interested in universities, teachings and in projects and how change can be organised trough projects. Which set the ground also for my interest to research and educate how to manage projects.
When I finally finished my graduate studies, I got a position at a newly established small department at WU focused on Project Management. I supported the establishment of that university unit, its research and education programme. Finally, I received a position funded by the university and started my doctorate in Project Management. I early got involved internationally in the International Project Management Association as I was taken there through my professor. That helped me immensely to build my network.
My first son was born shortly after I received my first university financed position. This caused quite some turbulence. I was questioned by my work environment if family was now my priority and if leaving academia would be better for me. I took a quite short maternity leave and went back to keep my position and finished my doctorate.
My career was only possible with my partner and especially the of my mother and the father of my partner. who helped a lot with the childcare. To make a university career in my context I had to pursue a Habitation, and which set a further milestone in my career that opened the door for my professorship.
Can you share a pivotal moment in your career that significantly influenced your path to leadership?
As an early career researcher, I received a quite tempting invitation to apply for positions at another university abroad. But I decided not to go for it as I would have needed to take the whole family to a different country. It would have been very difficult for my partner to find a job and I felt it was not appropriate to ask my partner and my family to start somewhere new just because of my career aspirations.
This is also the reason why I did my career at WU Vienna. While it was international and I have been engaged in International Associations like International Project Management Association or Project Management Institute, I remained a stable main position at WU Vienna. However as my children are now grown up, I did apply for a professorship at University College London and reduced my position at WU.
Ok, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. According to this report, only about 31.7% of top executive positions across industries are held by women. This reflects great historical progress, but it also shows that more work still has to be done to empower women. In your opinion and experience what is currently holding back women from leadership and management?
Many different issues. Most of them are structural
Woman are socialized with a set of desired behaviours expected from them.
Can you share a few reasons why more women should become leaders and managers?
Women and men are different, and this is good. People are different in their personalities and talents and hey bring different perspective and contributions.
Studies show that women in board rooms make a positive effect on company performance. The offer is to see women (and other minorities) rather as an asset and help to build structures to support them to provide contributions.
Can you please share “5 Things We Need To Increase Women’s Engagement in Leadership and Management?” If you can, please share an example or story for each.
First, targeted mentoring and coaching are essential. Women often face barriers to accessing high-quality mentorship, so structured programs help women identify their strengths, set clear goals, and navigate leadership challenges. I remember when my employer once said, “Try it for six months. If it doesn’t work, you can go back.” That kind of mentoring gave me a safe space to test my leadership skills without the fear of permanent failure, which really helped me move forward in my career.
Proactive networking is another important factor. Women need to actively create or join networks that connect them with senior leaders and like-minded peers. These networks provide access to important contacts and sponsorship opportunities.
Flexible working arrangements are also crucial. The challenge of balancing professional and family responsibilities often deters women from pursuing leadership roles. By adopting flexible hours, job-sharing, or part-time management positions, leadership roles can be made more accessible. In my own experience, I’ve seen the positive effects of companies offering more flexibility. In one example, a company revamped its policies to allow flexible scheduling, which allowed a talented leader to balance her childcare responsibilities with her role on the board. The result was improved team performance.
Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role.
Finally, objective recruitment and promotion processes are critical. Using methods like structured personality assessments and behaviour-based interviews helps combat unconscious bias and ensures candidates are chosen based on merit.
In your opinion, what systemic changes are needed to facilitate more equitable access for women to leadership roles?
Companies must embrace legislation that promotes gender diversity, like the EU’s push for more women on boards. However, quotas alone aren’t enough — accountability is key to preventing tokenism.
Corporate cultures need to evolve to value leadership traits that women excel in, such as empathy and collaboration. Changing outdated success metrics to reflect these qualities is essential, and recruitment and promotion processes must also be free from bias, prioritising merit over personal connections.
Work-life integration policies should be standard, not exceptions. Companies must normalise flexible work options for everyone, not just working mothers. Investing in female leadership development early on through mentorship, training, and networks like the WU Executive Academy’s Female Leaders Network ensures women have the resources to succeed in senior roles.
These systemic changes won’t happen overnight, but when companies and policymakers commit to action rather than discussion, real progress follows.
What strategies have you found most effective in mentoring and supporting other women to pursue leadership positions?
My main strategy is to empower young women to find their own ways and learn to trust in themselves. I am mentoring several women to help them in their academic careers. Very operationally I help them to understand their strengths and especially help them to understand they are not required to deliver 110% all the time. A trap that I have tapped in during my career and which I could not continue especially after I had my children.
A funny story to share was at one of my first panels I was invited to. I prepared so much and worked on my performance in every detail. I just wanted to be able to provide the perfect answers to all possible questions. Which is of cause not possible. However, I did not stop preparing and did not sleep the night before the event. So, when I was sitting at the panel, I was very tired, very serious and concentrated to get it all right. Without any smile, quite fact oriented. I was knowledgeable, said the right things, but my message was not convincing. It was just one boring smart voice among many others. Additionally, when others were speaking, I was so tiered that I simply fell asleep in front of 300 people. My sleep only took some seconds, and I still hope nobody saw it. However, that situation taught me an important lesson which I use to encourage women not to over prepare, take life a little easier, consider the package, how to deliver the message and not only what.
And yes we women cannot have everything at the same time. Children and major career steps at the same time is (almost) not possible to pursue at the same time. But there is also the right time for everything. Not everything needs to happen till the age of 35.
A good personal example is my recent career step, the appointment as Professor at University College London. When I was invited to apply, my youngest child was to finish School thus it was a window of opportunity that had opened, but it is then also a decision if you want to get you out of your comfort zone.
How would you advise a woman leader about how to navigate the challenges of being a woman in a leadership role within a male-dominated industry?
When I did my first formal education in Project Management, it was in 1996 and it was the Certificate Programme “International Project Management”, back then offered by the WU Vienna and the Technical University Vienna. There were 20 participants in class, 19 men and me. All of them having technical background mainly Engineering, Construction and Information Technology, the typical industries in which Project Management was applied back then. My background was Business Administration (specialized in Marketing) and I was the only woman. I was again an obvious alien, especially as I was the only woman in the room, and I was young. In this situation I asked myself whether I fit in? But reframed my question in what I can bring to the table, what are my competencies my talents that I can contribute and makes me add value. In this situation it was my social competencies, my strength to observe, listen and ask questions, thus my talent to lead processes in groups that added value and allowed me to add value. This is also my advice to women, know what you are good at understand what added value you can bring to the table. Be authentic and play to your strengths.
How do you balance the demand for authoritative leadership with the stereotypical expectations of female behaviour in professional settings?
Well use stereotypes like the hard man and the soft woman because that makes live easier to us. But the world is not black and white. If we look in more detail I do not believe in authoritarian leadership. Hero leadership is not working, especially not with younger generations. Hierarchies have become flatter, people want to work flexible, self organised, autonomy has become important, that is reflected in a modern leadership that is flatter, shared, distributed and often puts purpose in the foreground.
A leader needs be reflective person who takes decisions timely and is accountable for them. Core competences are to navigate uncertainty, embrace change, give orientation to others, think strategically and engaging others to co-create the future of an organisation. Today leaders should be able to stand in the spotlight but also is able to share the spotlight with others.

Since I am currently in Munich but usually live in Vienna, I would like to highlight the differences between Viennese and Munich residents. At first glance, one might not believe that Munich residents differ so much from Viennese, but a comparison reveals significant differences. Let’s first compare the cities to illustrate the differences.
The most noticeable difference is that Vienna is the capital of Austria, while Munich is “only” a large city in Germany. Munich is slightly smaller than Vienna and has fewer inhabitants. Although Munich has only three-quarters of Vienna’s population, it is three times as wealthy, which is evident in the people.
Usually, the population is divided into three classes: lower, middle, and upper class. In Munich, however, there seems to be no clear middle class, and the upper class appears very snobbish. This does not mean that there is no middle class, but rather that it is less noticeable. You see either people who look wealthy or those who appear poorer. The middle class behaves more subtly and hides in public: they either dress elegantly to appear upper class or wear normal clothes, making them seem poorer. I correct my previous statement and say that the middle class behaves discreetly. Now let’s look at the people in Vienna.
Vienna is divided into districts, but there are only a few districts that clearly represent a social class. Even in the wealthy districts, there are hardly any snobs or visibly rich people. In Vienna, the middle class predominates. Everyone looks as if they earn roughly the same. There are exceptions here as well, just like in Munich.
Although I have strongly criticized Munich here, it is a beautiful city. Of course, there are also unfriendly people in Munich, but I have not encountered any so far. In conclusion, both Munich and Vienna are worth visiting.

I wish I never met you.
I don't think there was any good reason behind it I think it was an accident.
Like, Fate got distracted looking at its phone, and when it looked back up, we’d crashed into each other, and it was too late.
The damage was done, and we had met.
I don't think it was a good lesson or that it had made me tougher or a better person I think it just became part of the reason I'm not the same anymore.
The reason I'm so closed off, the reason I don't trust people at all anymore.
I don't think we were supposed to meet.
I think it was a complete misfortune.
And sometimes I think about the day it happened and how one minor decision could have stopped the whole thing.
One moment could have saved me.
Because if we had never met, I would still be all the good parts of me, and there would be a few less parts that need to be fixed.
And I would still go for drives, but you wouldn't enter my thoughts like you were robbing a bank.
And I would still have these friends, but we would not reflect on how warped I was during the time you were a part of my life.
And I would still have fallen in love again, and it wouldn't have taken as much reassurance.
I wouldn't have been shocked that love is so different than I had originally thought.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, sure, but I'd be strong anyway, and the time I spent around you is dead to me, wasted time.
I wish I never met you.
I wish fate had been paying attention.
It was an accident that wasn't waiting to happen, a calamity, a catastrophe, a mistake.

Loving you was easy, letting go is tough!
You’ll never hear me say, “I wish I had never met you,” although sometimes I feel that way.
You’re my every thought — both the reason I cry and the reason I smile.
I never thought I’d be so hurt over something that didn’t last all that long.
The pressure on my heart when I think of how our relationship got worse and not better! But out of everyone who could have hurt me, why did it have to be you?

In praise of 15 minute cities: Why a ‘city of short distances’ feels better.
“People realised the state of their neighbourhoods could change. They could enjoy life in front of their front doors without owning a garden, without having a balcony,” said Vienna’s former Deputy Mayor, Maria Vassilakou.
Rated no.1 in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Global Liveability Index, Vienna frequently places as one of the world’s top cities to live in. And while it’s never explicitly called a 15- or 20-minute city, it nevertheless responds to the social, technological and ecological challenges that we all face.
Described as “the city of short distances”, urban planning policy in the city has long put pedestrians first (since the 80s, in fact). And, a few decades down the line, the results are evident everywhere: pavement expansions, improvements to public transport connectivity, sports provision and — notably — the longest continuous pedestrianised space in Europe, in the form of shopping street Mariahilferstraße.
Vienna feels equitable and inclusive, too. It’s affordable, for starters. And a focus on gender mainstreaming, a strategy adopted to achieve gender equality in society, has translated to things like fully illuminated footpaths, more entrances and exits to parks, grants for neighbourhood open space, and additional premiums for research conducted by women — a real-world commitment to urban planning that’s led by the needs and safety of citizens.
LIVEABILITY SCORE: 8/10. A compact and connected city geared towards pedestrians, safety and people-first infrastructure.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train.
We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars (they didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing).
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: Tell me about your dad.
Me: Jeez, I don’t really like talking about him.
Caroline: I can tell. But still… Try.
Me: Ok, tell me when to stop. He was a real piece of shit. Aside from being a 500 lbs. shut-in, he was a manipulative, habitual liar. Everything he did, he did in the name of self-interest. He smelled like literal shit and piss, and only got dressed a few times a year, usually for doctor appointments. His legs were so big, they were ripping open. He’d secretly order food then bury the remains deep in the trash. He was addicted to pornography (I found out after he died, when I was looking through his computer). When my girlfriend called the house, he’d listen in then deny it. I could always hear him breathing because he’d forget to press mute.
I have zero happy memories of him and prayed for his death for almost 10 years. He used to stay up all night, whaling and crying in the basement (where he lived), prompting me to cover all the vents with pillows. One time a friend heard him from outside and asked me if there was a dying animal in the house. There was, but I couldn’t admit it. During his final moments, when he pled to me for forgiveness, I did not absolve him or try to make him feel any better. I told him to be quiet, that his time had passed. When he died, I didn’t cry or feel sad, only relieved. His memory haunt me forever.
Caroline: Ok. That was a lot.
Me: I know.
Caroline: Is that why you use drugs?
Me: Hmm, I guess?
At the time I didn’t realize the direct connection between my mourning process and my drug use. I was still in the denial phase, and not in the sense of I couldn’t believe he died, rather, I was denying my own feelings. I’d done so much mourning while he was still alive that I’d assumed that part was done with. It was not. Drugs helped me cope with that, without me even realizing. Adderall kept me focused and productive, weed prevented me from being angry all the time, and alcohol allowed me not to care about life in general. Because of my regimented nature, I needed them all, every day, in the same amount, at the same times. Being a drug addict, more than anything, made life tolerable. I could focus on one thing: getting high, and not worry about all my sadness and pent-up anger.
We arrived in Vienna with no plans, and nowhere to stay, so we walked around the city center looking for a hostel. When we got tired of carrying our bags, we stopped in a bar to rest and ask for directions. Before Google and Yelp, it was bartenders who could tell you about every business within a 5-mile radius. “Don’t go to that one. Go to this one. Ask for Ron. Tell him I sent you.” There’s very little of that anymore.
The music disturbed me as soon as we walked in.
Me: What is this hot garbage they’re playing.
Caroline: It sounds like David Hasselhoff.
Me: You’re not going to believe this, but, in America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch. Isn’t that crazy?
Caroline: Are you being serious right now?
Me: Yeah, the same exact name.
Caroline: IT’S THE SAME PERSON.
Me: Wait… So, he’s a musician too?
Caroline: He’s the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He’s put out more than 20 albums.
Me: Are you sure there aren’t two of them?
Caroline: Also, we have Baywatch in Australia. I don’t live on the moon.
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. Regardless, his music was terrible, like a cheesier version of Depeche Mode. When I walked over to the Jukebox to put an end to it, I was shocked to find that all the albums were Hasselhoff. It was a fucking Hasselhoff bar. I felt like I was on a bad acid trip. We had one drink, as to not be rude, and while doing so met a few fellow backpackers. They were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner, and offered to take us there. To our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point. It had a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and my Adderall supply was dwindling. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of energy too.
That night we shared a couple bottles of wine (that was considered “not drinking” for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border), along with some ultra-thin paper to match, and I wanted to put them to use. (I love thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in your hand. My favorite type of paper when I was a kid was tracing paper. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers would tell me I couldn’t. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular lined paper and crumple it before writing on it. It made it softer. I don’t know why that mattered to me so much, but I bet it’s the same reason I don’t like museums.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far. Pat was, and still is, my best friend. He was the one I confided in after my dad died, and the first person I told the whole messy story to. He helped me mourn and continues to. I don’t know where I’d be without him.
Here’s an excerpt:
…You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It wasn’t that bad (it was). I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She has a great ass, in addition to being an awesome person. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
I told her about you, and she said to send her regards. We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though. Speaking of which, tell your mom I say hi. I hope your weird, home-schooled, born-again Christian girlfriend is magically becoming less lame, but I doubt it…
There were only a few beds available when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. After giving her a kiss, I said goodnight and went my own way. Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. If I’d had multiple outfits, I would have laid one out in anticipation.
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught her the rules of chess. She’d never played before, and though I wasn’t that good, I enjoyed teaching people how to play. Kevin taught me how to play. He’s beat me every single time then say something nice like “wow you’re so good now.” It only pissed me off more, though he meant it.
We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be. I could tell how much Caroline enjoyed feeling me press up against her. At one point she reached behind me to pull me closer, and I got an erection.
Me: I never thought I’d get a boner while playing chess.
Caroline: What is wrong with you?
Me: It’s a natural reaction to friction.
Caroline: Jesus, that’s not what I meant. Why do you say these things out loud?
Me: Isn’t that just part of my charm?
Caroline: I guess so, Mr. McEnroe. I guess so.
We went to a museum that afternoon but for the life of me I cannot remember which one, or what was inside. It could have been dinosaur bones or art; I have no clue. Museums are all the same to me, just a bunch of shit you can’t touch.
A Mitch Hedberg joke comes to mind…
“I was at a craft fair and there was a jar of Jellybeans. The guy said, ‘Guess how many Jellybeans are in the jar, and win a prize’. Aw, come on man, let me just have some.”
I mean, I want to party, not look at a party.
I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards bought a sausage with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few families laughed and pointed. When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about weed, I would have gotten high earlier.
While wondering around, we passed a skateboard shop that was loudly playing Raekwon’s, “Verbal Intercourse,” perhaps my favorite Wu-adjacent song. It pulled me in like a magnet. The Asian dude behind the counter gave us a welcoming look as soon as we walked in.
Me: Yo, I love this song.
Guy: Me too. He’s going to be at The Melkveg in Amsterdam next week. You going?
Me: I didn’t know about it, but I am now.
Guy: I’m going too. Maybe I’ll see you there.
Me: Hell yeah.
Guy: Do you need weed?
Drugs always find me.
Me: I do. Do you sell it?
He reached under the counter and pulled out a backpack filled with nearly a pound of weed.
Guy: I do.
He broke out a scaled and weighed 4 grams.
Guy: Will this get you to Amsterdam?
Me: You’d better double it.
Guy: Ha, ok. I feel you.
After making the exchange, we chatted for a few minutes. He asked me where I was from, and when I told him I’d just come from Brooklyn, he couldn’t believe how close I lived to the Wu-Tang Clan.
Guy: Have you ever been to Staten Island?
Me: No one not from Staten Island has ever been to Staten Island.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She’d made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?
When we got there around 8pm we were the only ones in the place. The entire bar was empty, the tables and booths too. The bartender welcomed us like he’d been waiting for company and waved us over to the bar. He looked visibly disappointed when we beelined for a booth. Neither of us were in the mood for small talk, so each time we needed drinks, I walked up to the bar to order. It became increasingly awkward with each trip, so I started ordering in bunches, which seemed to only bother him more. We were taking shots of Caroline’s favorite drink, Sambuca, my least favorite. “You have to drink it,” she told me, “It’s named after you.”
We got really drunk really fast, and after a few rounds we were making out at the table. The bartender gave us nasty “get a room” looks, but we ignored him. Then I devised a plan, one that has been devised many a time before, but never by me.
Me: Meet me in the bathroom.
I said it with confidence. It didn’t require a response. It was a command.
When she burst in, I pulled her pants down and put her in the sink, something I hadn’t premeditated. I was in a flow state.
I don’t care to divulge all the details of the experience, but I will say that there was no penetration. We got each other off, but didn’t cross that line. It was an unspoken agreement we had. Plus, I didn’t have a condom, and I was militant about using them. I’d go limp if I didn’t have one on. I know, weird.
After getting ourselves together, we exited the bathroom, where we were greeted by the bartender, who was holding our bill, visibly furious. I paid it, standing in front of the bathroom door, and we ran out, laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, at least in my experience. Caroline was laughing. She had no shame. I took her back and we chugged water in the waiting room.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean tonight?
Caroline: No, I mean “us”. Like, tonight we go to bed, and never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: What if we end up in the same place again?
Caroline: Then we can pick up right where we left off.
Me: Should we exchange emails?
Caroline: No.
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Exactly.
Me: (Kissing her cheek) Ok, goodbye Caroline.
Caroline: Goodbye Johnny Mac.
At the time I wasn’t sure if she was trying to get rid of me, or what her motivations were. Now I realize it had to do with timing (timing is everything). She knew when to get offstage. It was me that wanted an encore. Man, she was cool.

The Viennese street names not only serve as orientation in the street network, but they also tell stories and describe the character of the city.
The narrow Hafnersteig leads to the center of the “Fleischmarkt”. It was mentioned for the first time in 1220. Therefore, it’s the oldest meat market in Vienna.
In the basement of the house, that dates from the 17th century, is housed a well-known tavern, the “Yellow Eagle”, later known as “The Golden Eagle.
Learn a little patience. You never know what might be around the corner. Still, around it, there may wait, a new road or a secret gate.
The bakery in “Schönlaternegasse” was well known for its good bread. According to the legend, the basilisk was found in the well of a bakery by a young maid.
The Basilisk a mythological lizard type beast that was supposedly a cross-breeding of a cock, a toad, and a snake.
Georg, one of the baker’s helpers, who was secretly in love with the maid, volunteered to undertake this task to gain the Master’s approval of their marriage plan.
Down in the well, the basilisk looked into the mirror and when he saw how ugly he really was, burst up.
The well was filled in with stones, and our hero Georg married the young maid.
The blocks of houses in the so-called “Blutgassen” quarter in the first district, between Singerstraße, Blutgasse, Grünangergasse, and Domgasse, are among the oldest in Vienna.
Their foundations date back to the 12th century. The buildings erected on them date from the 16th and 17th centuries.
To which circumstance the blood alley (Blutgasse) owes its name has not yet been established. According to the legend, in Medieval times (1312) the Templars (monks) were brutally slaughtered in their courtyard (Fähnrichhof) and the blood ran down the little lane like a stream.
Nearby the St. Stephen’s Cathedral is the small street named Domgasse.
At the address “Domgasse 5” you can visit the only one existing Mozart’s apartments in Vienna. From 1784 to 1787, the composer lived in this Haus with his wife Constanza. During this period, Mozart wrote many works including his opera “The Marriage of Figaro”.
The first documented mention of a house on this property dates back to the 14th century. Since 1458 the bakers have settled in this area. According to the reports, this place is the birthplace of the famous Viennese croissants (Kipferl).
It is very unlikely, however, that this shape did not appear first at 1683 (allegedly to mock the Turks by the chosen shape of a crescent), as we already know that from the 13th century the bakers gave “chipfen” to dignitaries as a Christmas present.
Above the portal, there is a house sign with old pastry molds, which reminds us of the tradition.
From left to right and from top to bottom the following pastries are visible: Bosniakerl, Schusterlaberl, Kipfel, Brezel, Beugel and, a Girafferl.
The southern tower of St. Stephen’s Cathedral (136.7 m) is, without doubt, the main landmark of the city of Vienna.
Tradition speaks for Rudolf IV as the founder of the tower, the duke himself has laid the foundation stone in 1368. Its construction lasted 65 years, from 1368 to 1433.
At that time the south tower was the highest tower Europa’s, meanwhile, it’s between the top ten church buildings. The tallest church is in Ulm, Germany (161,5 m.)
During the Austria — Hungary monarchy no building was allowed to be built higher than St. Stephen’s Cathedral.

We arrived at the Residence to discover a spectacularly landscaped backyard:
We’re grateful for having arrived in time to enjoy it in all its blooming glory.
The dogs arrived unfazed and adapted quickly. They appreciated the opportunity to be outside in the gorgeous weather. Rosie assumed her sentinel stance…
…while Nero demonstrated his uncanny ability to get comfortable anywhere and on any surface, as long as it’s near us:
We had an opportunity to wander the commercial district on Währinger Straße near the Residence — an unforgettable first impression of the Vienna neighborhood:
And a grim reminder that the reverberations from Dallas are felt around the world:

Vienna is such a historic city known everywhere around the world for its art and culture. Here is an article that will help you to enjoy your trip in the capital of Austria.
Also, remember that I’m writing on Medium and that growing a huge community over there is very important for me. The name of my channel is “Clément Delabruyère” so please follow my channel : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a fascinating city that blends history with modernism. Covering an area of around 414 km², it is home to almost 1.9 million inhabitants. With its cobbled streets, Baroque palaces and prestigious museums, Vienna is a true cultural and architectural gem.
The city is divided into 23 districts, each offering its own unique charm and ambience. Vienna plays a major geopolitical role as the headquarters of numerous international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
Classical music has a special place in Vienna’s history, having witnessed the birth of legendary composers such as Mozart, Beethoven and Strauss. Viennese waltzes and famous operas still thrill the city. Vienna is also renowned for its culinary tradition, with historic cafés offering delicious pastries such as sachertorte.
The Schönbrunn Palace, a former imperial residence, and St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic icon, are among the iconic sites to visit. Well-tended gardens and abundant green spaces, notably Prater Park, add to Viennese quality of life.
Vienna stands out for its concern for sustainability and quality of life, regularly topping world rankings in this area. Its efficient public transport system and green initiatives are testimony to this commitment.
In short, Vienna embodies an enchanting blend of historical heritage, artistic creativity and contemporary progress, making it a city that captivates the hearts and minds of those who discover it.
Vienna’s history dates back to antiquity, when the Romans established a military camp on the banks of the Danube around the 1st century AD. This camp, called Vindobona, was the starting point for the city’s development. Over the centuries, Vindobona flourished as a point of convergence for trade routes and cultures, benefiting from its strategic position at the crossroads of Central Europe.
In the Middle Ages, Vienna became an important political and cultural center under the Babenbergs, then the Habsburgs from the 13th century onwards. In 1440, Emperor Frederick III established the imperial residence in Vienna, laying the foundations for a long period of imperial grandeur.
The 16th century saw Vienna confronted with the challenges posed by the Ottoman wars, with the sieges of Vienna in 1529 and 1683. These sieges were crucial moments in the city’s history, marking unsuccessful Ottoman attempts to conquer Central Europe.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Vienna became the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a major power in Europe. During this period, the city became a center of classical music and art, home to such geniuses as Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Baroque architecture flourished, giving rise to iconic buildings such as Schönbrunn Palace.
The 20th century was marked by upheaval, including two world wars and the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. After the Second World War, Vienna was divided into four zones of occupation, reflecting the Cold War period.
After the end of the occupation in 1955, Vienna regained its status as Austrian capital and diplomatic center. It hosted international organizations such as the UN and OPEC, consolidating its position in world affairs.
Today, Vienna continues to shine as a cosmopolitan city, blending its historic heritage with a dynamic modernity. The city has preserved its rich past while looking to the future, making it one of Europe’s leading cultural and intellectual destinations.
This imperial palace and its magnificent gardens are a symbol of the opulence of the Austrian Empire. Don’t miss a tour of the palace’s sumptuous rooms and a stroll through the well-kept gardens.
This iconic Gothic cathedral dominates downtown Vienna. Its elaborate architecture and impressive spire make it a must-see.
This Baroque complex comprises two palaces and superb gardens. It houses a remarkable collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt, notably “The Kiss”.
World-renowned for its superb acoustics and artistic performances, the opera house is an iconic venue for classical music lovers.
A former imperial palace, the Hofburg today houses several museums and institutions, including the Austrian National Library and the Sissi Museum.
This museum houses an exceptional collection of graphic art, including drawings, engravings and prints by masters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Dürer.
These two museums are located side by side and offer impressive collections of art and natural history.
This city park is home to the famous Wiener Riesenrad, Vienna’s iconic Ferris wheel, as well as numerous attractions, restaurants and green spaces.
These venues represent just a fraction of what Vienna has to offer in terms of culture, history and entertainment. The city is full of treasures to explore, and each corner offers a unique and enriching experience for visitors.
An Austrian composer prodigy, Mozart is one of the most influential figures in classical music. He composed over 600 works, including operas, symphonies and concertos, making a profound impact on the European musical landscape.
The father of psychoanalysis, Freud revolutionized our understanding of human psychology. His theories on the unconscious, the Oedipus complex and the role of dreams left a lasting imprint on the human sciences.
German composer and pianist, although born in Bonn, Beethoven spent much of his life in Vienna. He is famous for his transition from Classicism to Romanticism, with emblematic works such as his 9th Symphony.
Austrian Symbolist painter and leading figure of the Vienna Secession, Klimt is known for his ornate portraits and bold works, including “The Kiss”. He helped shape Art Nouveau and Modernism.
An Austrian Expressionist artist, Schiele was renowned for his provocative portraits and bold artistic vision. His unique style left a lasting imprint on 20th-century art, despite his untimely death at the age of 28.
These five figures left a significant mark on the history of art, music, psychology and culture in Vienna and around the world.
In order to conclude, if you have any ideas for improving this type of article (adding a section, for example), please let me know in the comments. Also, if there’s a place in the world that you particularly like and would like me to write another article about, I invite you to submit your ideas too.

“Be a fool. For love. For yourself.” -Bourdain
I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So, even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train. We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars. They didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like Coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing.
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: How are you doing since your dad died? Wanna let anything out?
Me: Well… I’m doing terrible, actually. He left me with all this pain and anger I don’t deserve or know what to do with. I thought he’d take it with him when he died, but somehow, he transferred it to me, and now I feel worse than I did when he was alive. If I’d known I’d feel this way in the end, I wouldn’t have cared about him so much; I wouldn’t have spent my whole life concerned about his health. What was the fucking point? Why did I put myself through all that when I didn’t have to?
Caroline: Sam, you learned how to be empathetic, and compassionate. You care about people deeply, that’s very rare. Those are all wonderful qualities you should be proud of. You took on responsibilities that no child should have to take on, but they only made you stronger, whether you see it now or not. Death is a part of life, and it sounds like you looked it right in the eye. It’s an experience you’ll cherish one day. I believe that. With time, the pain will ease, and you’ll begin to see the experience in a different light. Trust me.
Me: How do you know this?
Caroline: I’m an owl.
Me: So, what do I do in the meantime, until the pain eases?
Caroline: I don’t know, just keep hopping around. You’ll figure it out.

We arrived in Vienna with no plans, and nowhere to stay, so we walked around the city center looking for a hostel. When we got tired of carrying our bags, we stopped in a bar to rest and ask for directions. Before Google and Yelp, it was bartenders who could tell you about every business within a 5-mile radius. “Don’t go to that one. Go to this one. Ask for Ron. Tell him I sent you.” There’s very little of that anymore.
The music disturbed me as soon as we walked in.
Me: What is this hot garbage they’re playing?
Caroline: It sounds like David Hasselhoff.
Me: You’re not going to believe this, but, in America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch. Isn’t that crazy?
Caroline: Are you being serious right now?
Me: Yeah, the same exact name.
Caroline: IT’S THE SAME PERSON.
Me: Wait… So, he’s a musician too?
Caroline: He’s the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He’s put out more than 20 albums.
Me: Are you sure there aren’t two of them?
Caroline: We also have Baywatch in Australia. I don’t live on the moon.
While having a drink, we met a few fellow backpackers who were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner. They kindly walked us there, and to our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point, like almost hotel-level nice. There was a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and I was ahead of my planned Adderall pace because I was too kind to Simon. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of juice too.
That night we shared a few bottles of wine (that was considered not drinking for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border, along with some ultra-thin paper, and I wanted to put them to use. I LOVE thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in my hand. As a kid, tracing paper was my jam. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers wouldn’t let me. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular notebook paper and crumple it to make it softer.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far.
Aye,
You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It was as bad as you think it would be, maybe worse. I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, though, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though.
I talked to Caroline about my dad’s death yesterday. She, you, and 2 random ladies I met in Paris are the only ones who know how I’ve been feeling. I’m trying my hardest to share, but I don’t want to be a constant downer, ya know? Caroline told me it’ll get easier, like you did, but I just hope I’m not too far gone before the tide turns. Her brother died tragically, but she has more perspective than me because she’s an owl. I’m a frog, by the way. I’ll explain later.
I told Caroline about you, and she said to send her regards. So… Regards. I miss you, man. See you on the flip side.
Sam
The place was nearly full when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. We each had to take a single bed in one that was already occupied. So, after kissing goodnight, we parted ways.
Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. God, what an amazing feeling that was… Walking the halls before school, passing by your crush’s locker over and over, trying to make your meeting seem unplanned. “Oh me, I was just going to chemistry. Funny seeing you here,” you say, as if you’re not mentally orgasming. If they made a drug to capture that feeling, we’d all be addicted.
April 8, 2006
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught Caroline the rules of chess. Kevin was the one who taught me how to play. He’d beat me every single time then say something nice like “you’re really improving.” It only pissed me off more, but he meant it. We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be. I could tell how much she enjoyed feeling me press up against her. At one point she reached behind me to pull me closer, and I got an erection.
Me: I never thought I’d get a boner while playing chess.
Caroline: What is wrong with you?
Me: It’s a natural reaction to friction.
Caroline: Jeez, that’s not what I meant. Why do you say these things out loud?
Me: Isn’t that just part of my charm?
Caroline: I guess so, Mr. McEnroe. I guess so.

We went to a museum that afternoon, but for the life of me I can’t remember which one, or what was inside. It could have been dinosaur bones or art; I have no clue. Museums aren’t my thing. They do absolutely nothing for me. I mean, I want to party, not stare at a party.
A Mitch Hedberg joke comes to mind…
“I was at a craft fair and there was a jar of Jellybeans. The guy said, ‘Guess how many Jellybeans are in the jar, and win a prize’. Aw, come on man, let me just have some.”
I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards I bought a sausage accompanied with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few teens laughed and pointed while I poured water on my face to cool down. One kid called me a “Mus-tard.” I’ll never forget that little bastard.
When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about the smell of weed, I would have gotten high much earlier. I’ve always enjoyed spreading weed smoke to the masses. If you don’t like the smell, too bad. I don’t like your smell either.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush, Laura, loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?
When we got there around 8pm we were the only ones in the place. The entire bar was empty, the tables and booths too. The bartender welcomed us like he’d been waiting for company and waved us over to the bar. He looked visibly disappointed when we beelined for a booth. Neither of us were in the mood for small talk, so each time we needed drinks, I walked up to the bar to order. It became increasingly awkward with each trip, so I started ordering in bunches, which seemed to only bother him more. We were chasing beers with shots of Caroline’s favorite drink, Sambuca. You know how I feel about Sambuca. “You have to drink it,” she told me, “It’s named after you.”
We got drunk fast, and after a few rounds we were making out at the table. The bartender gave us nasty “get a room” looks, but we ignored him. Then, I devised a plan, one that has been devised many a time before, but never by me.
Me: Meet me in the bathroom.
I said it with confidence. It didn’t require a response. It was a command.
When she burst in, I pulled her pants down and put her in the sink, something I hadn’t premeditated. I was in a flow state. I took her shirt off and she did the same with mine.
Caroline: Do you have a condom?
Me: Shit, I don’t.
Caroline: You didn’t get one?
Me: I forgot.
Then, we heard a knock at the door.
Bartender: We don’t allow fucking in here. Come out now or I’m coming in.
We scrambled to put our clothes back on, then I opened the door. The bartender was still standing there, bill in hand.
Bartender: I added a cleaning fee. Pay now and go.
I handed him whatever money I had on me, then Caroline and I ran out laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, but Caroline laughed. She had no shame. Mid-vomit she posed a very serious question.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean, tonight? This doesn’t seem like a very high note.
Caroline: No, I mean “us.” Like, tonight we go to bed, and we never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: Holding your hair back while you vomit?
Caroline: No. I mean, before we complicate things. I want you to live in my mind as a perfect memory.
Me: It’s not because you don’t want to have sex with me, right?
Caroline: I very much want to have sex with you. It isn’t about that. It’s about preserving a special memory and locking it away in a little box that you can peek in whenever you want. I want you just like this.
Me: I could use a box with something nice in it… Right now, I only have ones I want to keep shut.
Caroline: You see what I’m saying?
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Yeah.
Me: What if we end up seeing each other again in another country?
Caroline: Then it was meant to be.
Me: Fair enough, pretty lady.
Caroline: Goodbye, my sweet Johnny Mac.
Me: Goodbye, Caroline.
I walked her to her room, gave her a kiss on the cheek, and that was it. She flew away the next morning, leaving me to hop around on my own, with my little box.

I’ve now been living in Vienna about a year and a half (my how time flies!).
I’ve seen so much so far but there are a couple of places I didn’t get to until today.
We’ve had very cold weather the past week or so, down to close to freezing temps at night, and so walking around or exploring isn’t exactly what one wants to do.
Today is a glorious sunny (and finally warm) day so I headed to the center to take in two beautiful and interesting historical places.
Kaiserliche Schatzkammer
First I went to the Imperial Treasury (Kaiserliche Schatzkammer) which is part of the large Hofburg palace complex the emperors of Austria lived in.
I highly recommend purchasing tickets online before you go. While today’s line wasn’t too long, in spite of the plethora of tourists in town, you can just walk right in and get your online ticket scanned to enter without having to wait for than a few seconds.
You enter a few darkened rooms which contain all kinds of imperial and church artifacts, such as crowns, robes, orbs and the like. It’s not that big but you do learn a lot about Austrian history throughout the ages and also the growth and collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian empire over the centuries.

It is supposed to be the best restaurant in Vienna and the only Austrian entry (at No.15) on The List. Everyone we met in Vienna had only good things to say about the place, and we’d managed (I am still not sure how) to get a reservation at short notice. By the time Wednesday evening came, we’d had our fill of Weinerschnitzel and Tafelschpitz and 4 long days of conference food, and our anticipation over this meal had reached a fever pitch.
The Steirereck is located at the end of a long driveway leading into the heart of Stadtpark. It’s ensconsed in an elegant glass walled building that was glowing golden with incandescent light on a dismal wet Austrian evening of our dinner reservation. As I walked up the drive I was almost disappointed that we only managed a dinner reservation. I could imagine how incredibly impressive the high glass windows of the nouveau architectural building would have looked on a sunny Austrian afternoon.
When we sit down we are informed by the server that Austrian law requires that allergy information be printed on the menu alongside every dish. And so it is, in excruciating detail with a legend down by the bottom of the page listing every conceivable food item that you can be allergic to. A short while later, dish after dish of pre-starters pour out of the kitchen. As we start to go through them we realise a curious alignment with the legend at the bottom of the menu. Displaying a decidedly non-Austrian sense of humour, the restaurant has used the allergy information that they are required to include on the menu as the inspiration for each of the starters.
I’m not sure how it got to be like that but I get the distinct feeling that the chef draws a lot of his inspiration from bees and honey. And it starts with the char that is cooked (by the side of our table) in molten beeswax. I’ve seen a number of table-side preparations and been to my share of molecular magic side-shows but this was a truly impressive (unexpectedly so) performance. The char fillets are placed carefully in a nondescript wooden tray. They then pour molten beeswax into the tray till it completely covers the fish. Before our eyes the fillets begin to change colour from their normal translucent state to the opaque white that we are accustomed to seeing.
They give it about 15 minutes and then gently ease the fish out of the beeswax that has now hardened solid. The fish pops out whole and perfectly cooked. They take it away to do some magic in the kitchen and it comes to the table beautifully plated with a long carrot and some sour cream.
They aren’t stingy with their vegetables at Stierereck and for someone who really likes his meat that can sometimes come in the way. Hidden somewhere under the many layers of coloured bell peppers and melon was some Venus clam and I was darned if I could find it. That apart the dish tasted exquisite with many layers of flavour and texture from the mild sweetness of the peppers and melon, to the mouthfeel of Jerusalem artichokes all tied in with the oily overtones of macadamia and black olives.
They followed this up with a mini garden of herbs, porcini mushrooms, green verbena leaves and nuts that I have to admit was not overwhelming, delicate presentation notwithstanding. It’s a dish I thought they would have done well to leave out of the tasting menu and serve only to the vegetarians (but maybe that is my prejudice showing).
The meal is accompanied by little cards that they stick in a sort of a stand by your plate. It contains a description of the dish you are currently eating – with far more detail than one would get from a traditional restaurant menu. They are also convenient pocket-sized keepsakes of the meal and saved me from requesting a copy of the menu as I always do.
It’s from these little cards that I realised that the Job’s Tears that were referred to in the description of the next course on the menu was more than just a Biblical reference but an actual plant (Coix lacrimal-jobi) that is eaten as a vegetable in China and the Far East. In this dish the Job’s Tears had been crisped up and served in a tiny conical wrap that preserved its crunchy texture. I am a fan of carp so I had no complaints with the fish or in fact the entire dish, which had a distinctly Eastern sensibility – thanks in large part, I am sure, to the flavours of Pandan Oil that tied the entire thing together.
I can’t say I was terribly enthused by the Lamb. It was a good hunk of meat, well cooked, if not particularly well seasoned. I can’t fault the technique except that at a restaurant with these credentials I’d have expected a more tasty serving. I thought the popcorn was a treat – it carried the flavour of coffee (which was interesting) and the vegetables were tasty and crunchy – I particularly liked the grilled baby corn. I learned that the sauce was made from the Scarlet Monarde grown in the Steirereck gardens and that imparted the familiar flavours of bergamot to the dish.
The meat course of the day had to be the Venison. I’m a huge fan of well cooked venison – I like the tender, pliable and succulent texture of the meat as well as characteristic slightly games (in a good way) flavour of the meat. They serve the venison with perfectly cooked half moons of squash, baby artichoke hearts sliced flat and a sauce of orange blossom. All in all an excellent pairing of textures and tastes. Clearly the dish of the day for me.
I can’t say any of the desserts really knocked it out of the park. They were all fruity and seasonal — summery even which was a bit of a contrast to the wet weather outside. But none of them rose to the level of brilliance that I have seen at the best restaurants in the world.
Of the desserts on the table, the prize for prettiness clearly went to the Crepe which was served in a roll of delicate strips of crisp and crunchy batter. Alongside the shredded crepe was a colourful row of violet flowers and a delicious puree of medlar.
I started out by remarking on the subliminal presence of bees and honey that hovers in the background of the meal. As I should have expected, the finale to the meal was a selection from the impressive selection of artisanal honeys available at Steirereck.
They rolled out a trolley that contained racks and racks of different varieties of honey, including a healthy selection of honeycombs. They made a show of opening a small porthole at the side — whereupon we heard a furious buzzing. It took us a moment — a very nervous moment — to realise that this was just a recording and that we were not about to be swarmed by angry bees. The server was knowledgeable — or at least he seemed to be given that I have next to no apiary knowledge to be able to question his claims — and we all selected a few varieties to taste.
But taste was all we could manage. Much as I love raw honey, at the end of a sumptuous meal a few licks of the back of a spoon was all I could manage. What we did taste was, surprisingly, subtly different — the local floral conditions clearly make a difference to the end product. I wish we could have carried a few bottles home.
There is no doubt that Chef Heinz Reitbauer is a master of his ingredients. He has two Michellin Stars, four Toques and a place in The List. The location of the restaurant, inside the large and verdant Stadtpark is unmatched and from pictures on the Internet, I would imagine it would have been even more spectacular on a sunny Austrian summer afternoon.
And it is a good restaurant. Some of the dishes (the molten beeswax char in particular) were imaginative and unique. The use of locally produced ingredients and the quaint connection with honeybees is charming. Not having eaten extensively in the region, I cannot really comment with authority but I will not be putting up any arguments if someone claims it is the best restaurant in Austria.
But is it deserving of its place on the list (which, I should remind you, is down from its highest rank at No. 9 in 2013)? I am not convinced. I have eaten at places far lower down the list that have turned out food that is equally exquisite but done so consistently, course upon course without a hitch.
No. 15? Maybe not.

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

An Austrian Wildlife Icon
These cute animals are European Ground Squirrels, which I saw whilst on holiday in Vienna.
I hadn’t even heard of them until quite recently. Over the last few years, the British media have been publishing more and more photos of ground squirrels and other wildlife in Vienna. Eventually, I couldn’t resist heading over to Austria to see what was going on for myself.
There are plenty of public parks in Vienna, but, as far as I know, only a couple of them have ground squirrels. All of my photos were taken at the Blumengärten Hirschstetten, which you can get to quite easily by tram.
Visit in spring or summer, and you should have a great chance of seeing the squirrels. I spotted several within minutes of arriving, and one of them ran right up to my feet as if it was welcoming me to the park.
I assume the squirrels are used to people feeding them, although there are signs asking you not to.

You know that feeling when a song hits you right in the gut? Like, it wasn’t just made for you, but like it somehow knew what you needed to hear before you even did? That’s what “Vienna” by Billy Joel did to me.
I came across that song again during my drive home, on a random night just a few weeks ago, when I was overanalyzing my life, my future, and whether I’m already too late to do something meaningful. The classic mid-to-late 20s spiral, you know? One minute I’m driving slowly through the city, the next I’m questioning my entire existence.
Then, boom; “Vienna waits for you”.
I don’t know what it is about that line, but it unlocked something in me. I’ve never thought about, let alone visited Vienna. Maybe it’s the gentle piano intro. Maybe it’s the way Billy sings it like a wise old friend sitting next to me at 3AM, telling me to breathe.
“Slow down, you crazy child. You’re so ambitious for a juvenile.”
I felt exposed. How dare he come for my entire personality like that? But also, he’s right. I am ambitious. I’ve always wanted to get things done fast, prove myself, complete all the milestones before I hit my imaginary deadline. And lately, that mindset has been eating at me. I kept thinking, “Why don’t I have everything figured out yet?”
But Vienna reminds me that I don’t have to. I’m still young. A 26 year-old is basically a 6 year-old in the “adult” life. And “youth” doesn’t mean I have to hustle 24/7. It means I have time to figure things out. It means I can still dream big without burning out trying to make it happen as fast as possible.
There’s something deeply comforting about being told that it’s okay to not be in a rush. We don’t get that a lot. Being told that success doesn’t expire at 30. That if I haven’t landed my dream job, or released that album, or written that book yet, it doesn’t mean I have failed. It just means I’m still on my way.
And that’s more than okay.
“Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.”
That line gets me every time. Because that fire, yes. I have felt it. I still feel it. The desire to do something great, to not waste time. But sometimes, that fire turns into anxiety. Into comparison. Into restlessness. And this song basically told me, “Hey, chill. You have time. You’re doing fine.”
Lately, every time I get overwhelmed about the future or about the feeling like I’m not doing enough, I put this song on. And for those three and a half minutes, I always feel like the noise quiets down. I remember that life isn’t a race. That I don’t have to catch up to anyone. That I’m allowed to take detours, to pause, to just… be.
And beyond all that, the song just feels beautiful. The melody is gentle, a little wistful, but hopeful. It’s not sad. It’s patient. Like Vienna itself, whatever it symbolizes, it can wait. It’s not going anywhere. And neither is my worth.
I think the main thing that Vienna taught me is: I’m not late. I’m not behind. I’m exactly where I need to be. And sometimes, slowing things down is the most powerful thing I can do.
Because Vienna waits for me.
And that’s more than enough.

The Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons, dubbed “Humanity at the Crossroads,” addressed the urgent need to regulate deadly autonomous weapons systems. As a youth delegate, I gained valuable insights into this critical issue. Here’s a snapshot of what I learned:
Understanding the Big Picture
The conference shed light on the serious challenges posed by autonomous weapons. They could make conflicts worse, harm civilians, and disrupt efforts to keep peace worldwide.
Why Human Control Matters
A key lesson was the importance of humans staying in charge of decisions about using force. Letting machines make life-or-death choices raises big moral and legal questions. We need clear rules to make sure people are responsible and to stop these weapons from causing harm.
Talking Ethics
We spent time discussing what’s right and wrong when it comes to autonomous weapons. We talked about how to respect people’s dignity and protect them from these weapons’ dangers. We also thought about how using these weapons might change society in the long run and change our relationship with technology.
Challenges We Face
Even though many people agree on the need for rules, there are still big challenges ahead. Some powerful governments and tech companies control a lot of the conversation. It’s tough for other voices, like from everyday people and community groups, to be heard.
Youth Power
Young people like us played a big part in the conference. Our fresh ideas and energy showed how important it is to get everyone involved in the discussion to address autonomous weapons. We left feeling inspired and ready to push for change in our communities.
What Comes Next
The conference wasn’t just talk, it was a call to action. We agreed to work even harder to establish strong global rules for autonomous weapons. But it won’t happen overnight. We need to keep up the pressure and work together to make real change.
In sum, the Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons was a chance to learn, share ideas, and get ready for action. We learned how crucial it is to keep humans in control of decisions about life and death in warfare. As we move forward, let’s stay focused on making the world safer and fairer for everyone.

The first time I heard Vienna by Billy Joel, I was on a train home after college, the world outside dipped in the amber light of a tired evening. I had just bombed an interview I had poured my soul into. My head was a whirlwind of spiralling doubts — about my future, about whether I had what it takes, about everything. And then Vienna arrived — not like a pop anthem or an uplifting chorus, but like a friend who sits with you in silence and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
“Slow down, you crazy child
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you’re so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid?”
In that moment, tears welled up — not because of the failure, but because of how deeply the song understood the ache behind it. How it met me in the in-between, where so many of us live: driven but unsure, hopeful but exhausted.
That lyric wasn’t just about me. It was about a generation raised to hustle, to quantify their worth through grades, internships, side projects, and glowing LinkedIn posts. I had come to think of life as a ladder. But Vienna whispered of a different metaphor — a garden, perhaps. Something that grows in time, with pauses, with pruning, with seasons of bloom and rest.
It reminded me of The Midnight Library by Matt Haig — a book about a woman who, burdened by regret, stumbles upon a mystical library containing infinite versions of her life. Each book in the library reveals a different path she could have taken. The novel forces you to ask: what if the life you’re racing toward isn’t the one that would’ve made you happy? What if the pauses, the missed exits, the so-called failures, are the very fabric of the life meant for you?
“When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?”
In Joel’s metaphor, Vienna isn’t a destination you rush to. It’s the life that waits — patiently, quietly — for you to stop sprinting long enough to hear its music. It’s the version of you that grows not by doing more, but by understanding what enough feels like. That revelation mirrored the essence of The Midnight Library: the idea that you’re not a failure just because you’re not on someone else’s timeline.
The truth is, I didn’t need a new plan that day on the train. I needed perspective. I needed someone — or something — to tell me that I hadn’t missed my moment, that there are many doors yet to open. And Vienna, in its tender, piano-laced wisdom, did exactly that.
“You can get what you want or you can just get old
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through”
Those words haunted me. Because I had never thought of burnout as a kind of death. But that’s what it is: the death of wonder, of joy, of being here. I was chasing a life so hard that I was forgetting to live the one already unfolding around me.
Billy Joel’s Vienna didn’t just soften my ambition — it redefined it. It told me that ambition rooted in fear is a form of imprisonment. But ambition rooted in patience? In stillness? That’s purpose. That’s wisdom.
So now, when I feel that panic — that rising tide of “not enough,” of “too late,” of “what am I doing with my life?” — I don’t drown. I return to the song. To Joel’s voice, gently guiding me back.
“Slow down, you’re doing fine.”
And just like the woman in The Midnight Library learns: the life you’re meant to live isn’t the one with the loudest applause. It’s the one where you’re fully alive. The one that waits for you — just like Vienna.

On the title page of Red Vienna, a new novel by Eve Neuhaus, she opens with a quote:
In the dark times,Will there be singing? — Bertolt Brecht
This poignant question resonates deeply, especially given that Neuhaus’s novel is set in Vienna during the years leading up to the Anschluss — the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany on March 13, 1938. These were indeed “dark times,” and Brecht’s words evoke the struggle for hope amidst adversity.
Interestingly, Bertolt Brecht’s sentiment may have inspired similar reflections in modern music. The British group Ultravox released their iconic song “Vienna” in 1980, echoing themes of darkness and longing. Some of their lyrics vividly capture this sense of foreboding:
Walked in the cold airFreezing breath on a window pane…A man in the dark in a picture frameA voice reaching out in a piercing cry…Oh Vienna(Songwriters…

Things that I’m a sucker for while traveling: a unique building, a nice park, and a spooky cemetery. I will go out of my way to see these. Even if it means traveling across an entire city.
So years ago, when I was traveling in Vienna with my parents, that’s exactly what I did. I had heard about this cool building, called Hundertwasserhaus.
Although I was in my 30s, living on my own in a foreign country, and had traveled around the world, my mom didn’t want me to go alone. So she tagged along.
It’s curved, it’s straight, it’s a building, and it’s a garden.
Hundertwasserhaus is hard to describe, but it overloads your mind when you see it. There is so much to look at.
It is a colorful, eclectic apartment building. It was built in the 1980s with multiple styles and built on different planes. The windows are different sizes. The facade changes from stucco to trompe l’oeil to brick to mosaic. The street level boasts unusual, non-uniform colorful columns.
Trees pop out of the building in unexpected places. The artist called these trees on the building “tree tenants.”

→ Martin Hanley: A Memoir
This memoir was written in 2004/2005
I was born on March 14th, 1931 to Margarethe and Leopold Hahn of Neueweltgasse 23 in Hietzing, Vienna. Hitzing, then as now, was a pleasant leafy, upmarket suburb, our home perhaps just ten blocks distant from Schonbrun Palace, one of the sumptuous palaces built by the Habsburg dynasty.
One of my earliest recollections goes back to the age of 5. Opposite our first floor apartment was a little triangle of grass, with a few flowers and 2 garden benches, which was tucked in between our building and the main road, the Hitzinger Hauptstrasse. The apartment had deep window ledges on which I could stand and lean against the wrought iron railings which were erected for security reasons. Later I watched Hitler’s tanks roll into Vienna from this balcony. As we lived on the 1st floor there were only a few steps to the ground floor and I was allowed to ride on the garden path alone on a tricycle parked in a ‘cave’ under the building. After the war I visited our old home with Susi my wife, and found the ‘cave’ to be a little opening in the building near the staircase outside.
Apart from the “Schonbrun” palace of the Emperors, Hitzing boasted a zoo and many coffee houses of note. The coffee house was an important factor in my parents’ generations enjoyment of life. Its ambience, seating arrangements, free offering of daily newspapers to its clientele, not to mention the quality of its coffee and ‘mehlspeisen’ or cakes was serious business, similar in importance to the Anglo Saxon pub or the American local bar.
Listening to stories of the older generation I realized that although acquisition of luxuries and assets were not on the agenda, my parents and their circles lived a very agreeable life. I have pictures of family holidays taken in villages, on lovely lakes, of my parents at parties and so on. It can be explained by understanding the culture of European middle class life. In Austria, especially Vienna, the culture of theatre, music, stays in the country in summer and skiing from peasant huts in the mountains in winter was maintained to a greater or smaller degree.
Living on the outskirts of Vienna there were advantages for me, as in winter I could be taken on my sled to the ‘Rotenberg’ or Red Hill to slide up and down in the snow on fine afternoons. My Nanny would pull the sled up this little hill in company with other nursemaids similarly out with their charges. Nanny was a fixture, and one of whom I have fond memories. I have a picture of her with me in my leather pants aged perhaps two or three. She also cooked and made the beds. As she had off only one Sunday every fortnight some might say that she lived in slavery. Not so. She was part of the family and had a home which was warm in winter and where meals were regular. A small pittance was hers to spend as well. Far different from where she came from. This enabled people like my parents to live a very civilised life with very little money.
In the depression, working people in industry or on the land saw real hardship. I was given a spare lunch to school to distribute to children less fortunate than I.
My father was a hard worker all his life. In the 1920s and 30s he worked as a salesman in his father’s firm, Adolf Hahne & Sohne, a merchant of “spitzen” — feathers, boas, lace and embroideries, the traditional Austrian lace, still seen in minute quantities today, was used on almost every woman’s garment. In white or colourful on ‘dirndl’, the traditional skirt, for blouses, on caps and underwear. The firm had prospered in the period when ‘Dirndl’, the Austrian national costume, was the mode. Manufactured and distributed worldwide, laces were an important ingredient of fashion for what must have been at least 2 generations, as my grandfather had inherited the business. In my father’s time his 2 sons were in the business, both as salesmen. My Uncle Walter’s sales territory was part of Germany and France. He enjoyed himself very much one believes as he was single, tall and handsome. He had a good time by all accounts.
My father, on the other hand, was allotted the tougher territory, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia and suchlike. Although also handsome, he was already married and the small traders he dealt with, mostly Jewish haberdashers in little country towns were prone to be cashless, especially after a family wedding, birth or bar mitzvah. He travelled for several weeks at a time, in a small ‘Steyer’ motor car on terrible country roads.
In Vienna, in the thirties, survival in business was not always guaranteed. The Depression had driven my grandfather’s firm into bankruptcy three times. Bankruptcy in those days evolved into a sort of payment agreement, in German: “ausgleich”. Say you owed a hundred thousand with no prospect of paying it back. You settled with your creditors for whatever, agreed….and then carried on. My father’s stories to me of his “ausgleich” experiences with his customers, though funny, hid the tensions of those times.
When Hitler walked into Vienna, Jewish premises were “Arisiert”, meaning literally ‘Arienised’ (as in Aryan!) ie. Nazified…Nazi hoodlums, some in uniforms, entered, demanded all keys and normally gave the occupants a few hours to take their personal effects and get out. Confiscated just like that… period, full stop… premises, stock, bank accounts.
That didn’t happen to Adolf Hahn & Sohn, because the business had gone broke some years before. The company went into receivership in 1932. The Depression added another victim, but it not only the lack of business which was the cause. My grandfather, who must have been well in his sixties, married Claire, an elegant woman a good 30 years his junior. This necessitated a new house with fine furniture and the trimmings. The romance proved too big a burden on the business, as well as the two family members who worked in it.
The German Wehrmacht were welcomed by the Austrian populace after the “Kristallnacht” Troops occupied Vienna from March 13th, 1938. On March 14th, my birthday, I stood on my window balcony and observed with childish fascination the armoured wagons, mobile cannons and personnel trucks standing on the road outside, the uniformed Wehrmacht soldiers laughing and joking with the locals while the Hietzing Synagogue around the corner was torched.
We lived in the same apartment until we escaped from Vienna, except for the very last few days when we stayed hidden in a city apartment owned by ‘Tante Ida’, my grandfather’s sister and a very old lady. I was later told my father had already hidden there for a few days previously.
In the months from the Anschluss till we left the country in September 1938, I continued to attend the same school. My only vivid memory was of the same teacher, but he was wearing a red armband with a black swastika on a white circle and the Hebrew teacher’s red star of David on a yellow armband. We children did not wear any outward marking at that time.
It was time to leave Austria, where my family roots went back at least for the 3 generations I knew.

→ Vienna
By 1938, America, England, Canada, Australia and most other countries had either tightened immigration intake or outright banned foreigners. Apparently a Mr. Rogers, an Australian businessman, was visiting Vienna in 1938 and somehow met our family. He offered to help and assisted my father applying for a visa to Australia, sponsoring us. The application was refused. Mr. Rogers subsequently wrote telling my father that stating to be a tradesman as a “chauffeur” was the worst entry possible as his son, aged 17, “could drive a car better than you can!” That was the end of that.
The Depression had not lifted entirely in most of the Western world. In any case, the few who did receive visas to desired country destinations had to have sums of money my father did not possess. My grandfather’s business, in which my father and his brother Walter worked, barely supported the family. This was not entirely due to economic conditions — it has been attributed largely to my grandfather’s second marriage to a beautiful woman some 30 years younger than himself. She apparently required a new house with the best trimmings.
Jews who didn’t make it to desired country destinations had the possibility of buying passports for entry to South American countries like Argentina and Uruguay. Switzerland was open only to the super rich, and then only as permanent ‘tourists’. Refugees like my parents, who left matters too late with very little money, found safety in the few destinations that made no demands. There was Shanghai, Trinidad, Curacao, and small black African states. Israel, Palestine in those days, was quite sealed against Jewish immigration by British decree, although several hundred young people entered and were smuggled in right throughout the war.
You didn’t need an entry visa, you just had to get there.
My parents found a way to Shanghai, as did about 19,000 Jewish refugees from Hitler. A temporary “Thru-visa” was available from Italy. This was issued on sight of a steamship ticket to Shanghai purchased from Italian line Lloyd Triestino, on one of the boats that steamed a regular route from Genoa to Shanghai, for an exorbitant sum. Only First Class tickets were available as a matter of course. I don’t know how but this sum was found for the Hahn family of 2 adults and a child. Train tickets were purchased to Genoa.
I remember a young girl, about my age, boarded the train with us. I never learned what was the family’s relationship to us, but my parents agreed to take her along. She was taken off the train at the border between Austria and Italy during the night, I presume because she was without papers. I have never been told what became of her and I have since often wondered whether she was returned to Vienna and her parents safely.
After a few days in Genoa we embarked on the mv. Victoria, the smallest but newest of the Lloyd Triestino fleet that sailed to the Orient regularly. We owned several ‘cabin trunks’ full of possessions and 114 British pounds. The voyage was a great delight for my parents, despite what must have been anxiety for the future. The mv. Victoria was the smallest ship in the line, but the latest and most modern.
First class service in all respects was still pre-war and luxurious. The voyage was very romantic, landing at exotic ports along the way. In Port Said, at the southern end of the Suez Canal, a great fête was held with native dancers and a feast was prepared on the dock. I believe it was an Egyptian version of an Aussie barbecue with whole beasts being cooked. Local citizens were present as well as the ship’s passengers. I was allowed down to the wharf for a little while and then taken to the cabin to sleep. I never learned why the celebration. I cannot remember the landing in Bombay or the three days passed in Singapore. Then came Hong Kong and lastly Shanghai.

The day that i actually listened and absorb the lyrics of the song “vienna” by billy joel, it hits. That song represents me so much, the things i couldn’t put into words, that song represents exactly how i feel. I’ve always constantly running nonstop, wonder when will it ends, i’m so exhausted, everyday is a constant battles i have to get through. One line from that song that cuts deep was “only fools are satisfied” cause i slowly realizes that i kept begging for validations from everyone around me even the ones i barely knew, i kept doing what they perhaps wanting me to do so that they’ll like me and i can finally be in peace but that’s not what happens instead i felt more empty and sad for myself, letting myself go through all those things just to be accepted and liked. Why am i running? why am i rushing? what am i searching for? why do i keep doing this to myself? for whom? for what? i’m still questioning myself those questions and still haven’t found the answers. What i do know is i want this to stop, i want to live FOR me, vienna waits for me, i’m WAITING for ME, to finally be happy with who i am without the need of other people acceptance.

Vienna is one of several European capitals that I’ve personally visited many times, and it’s also one of the most visited cities in Europe and the entire world.
The picturesque Austrian capital is renowned to be one of the most liveable cities in the world, and for some very good reasons!
From a personal perspective, I already know 3 people from my little tiny country (Luxembourg) that studied in the city and subsequently decided to never leave the place and start a new life there. From all over the world people flock to Vienna, either for tourism or to move there permanently.
But what are the reasons that make Vienna such a globally recognized hotspot to live in? What makes Vienna so special in regard to other European capital cities?
Having visited the city on 4 separate occasions, I will today line out my 5 personal reasons why Vienna is considered the most liveable city in Europe, and why it is up there with the most liveable cities in the world.

I didn’t go to Vienna with a checklist. No Schönbrunn palace on the agenda. No museums lined up by hour. Just three slow-moving days, a waterproof camera backpack, and a promise to myself not to overthink it.
From the airport, I caught the 10.5€ bus to Westbahnhof and checked into a small guesthouse nearby. Quiet street. Solid sleep. Five-minute walk to most things that mattered.
I skipped the palaces and headed straight to a corner market for a mustard-soaked pretzel and a table with no view. I sat longer than I meant to. It was a good start.
I stumbled across the Musikverein just before noon. No grand performance, just a chamber rehearsal in the golden hall. I sat in the back. Stayed through most of it.
Across the square, the House of Music pulled me in by accident. I don’t usually do interactive museums, but this one surprised me. No pressure to move quickly. No crowds. Just quiet sound rooms layered like dreams.
Later, I caught the U-Bahn to Donauinsel, found a bench by the river, and watched the clouds shift. It started to rain lightly, but everything stayed dry — my gear, my layers — all tucked into that camera backpack I almost didn’t bring.
I walked aimlessly in the city centre, ducked into St. Peter’s Church, and followed the scent of coffee to K.u.K. Heiner. It felt more imperial than the cakes themselves — but the atmosphere was enough.
Dinner was at Neubauschenke: pork stew, beef broth, locals in padded vests. I sat near the back and scribbled some notes. Later, Papaya served me one of the better duck salads I’ve had in Europe. Spicy, fast, no English menu — perfect.
I didn’t plan this trip, and it still worked.
Because Vienna is good to people who walk slowly, who sit a little longer, and who carry light.
If you’re thinking of going, don’t overpack. A lightweight waterproof camera backpack will do. The rest, the city gives you.

I love Vienna! I've only visited once, but it's a beautiful city with a fascinating history. I recently read Richard Cockett's Vienna: How the City of Ideas Created the Modern World, which left my head spinning. I wish you didn't have to write about book censorship there as well, but I'm glad that you are doing it. Thank you!

Vienna is so special to me… It will always be the city with unforgettable many memories. I feel tons of emotions on that trip: fear, love, excitement, suspicion, admiration, understanding, enthusiasm… Vienna is waiting for me, again.
Vienna is filled full of first experiences for me. First trip, first abroad, first flight… I am grateful that it all started with Vienna.
I have two of my best friends while in Vienna, we explored together, we laughed, we danced (it was so funny), tasted…
We stayed in the most beautiful hotel and after many experiences, it still protects its place on my top list. I can recommend it with peace of mind. Our receptionist was cheerful, friendly and sincere. He talked about his travels to our home country, tried to talk in our main language, sent videos about our traditional foods on WhatsApp… When I look at our hotel’s photos or think about it, I feel the beautiful smell of the hotel exactly. Magical.
We arrived in Vienna in the evening, and after settling in the hotel, we went to Mariahilfer Street. Since it was the first time, I was shocked by the early closing of the shopping places. The life stops early… I am not used to it.
The second day in Vienna started with a meeting with our Erasmus student friend at Karlskirche, it was a long time since we had seen him. Also, we met with a student from Vienna Technical University who was very interested in cars and Austria.
Our city exploration started! There were a lot of architectural masterpieces… Fascinating!
I had a detailed plan for the itinerary, nevertheless we started to be ahead on the plan. We went to Hundertwasser Houses and Prater on the second day instead of the third day.
I think we give the biggest appreciation to Prater… Me and my friend really like the Before Sunrise movie, and the place was special for us. We recorded videos, spent many times at the photo booth cabin, watched… It was fun.
My friend had kept talking about Wiener Rathaus since we arrived, her excitement spreaded to me. First, the architectural beauty captured us, then a closer look… Ice rink, fancy ornaments… All was magical. There was a song playing, suddenly we started to dance haha it was silly but funny! We stood right next to the ice rink and started watching around. I tried to keep that atmosphere in memory with every detail. Kids were skating, laughs were everywhere. Also, the screen on the building shows the area sometimes, we were seeing ourselves on the screen. Shaking hands… Our cheeks were hurting from smiling!
Third day, again St. Stephan Cathedral. One of the favorite spots…
We went to gothic Votivkirche.
We had melange on a cafe has Votivkirche view. It was delicious and despite of being soft coffee served with water, interesting.
Bonus Memory!
I studied for my lesson and before coming to Vienna, I researched Sisi and watched the trio. There were many references in the streets. Understanding them was making me feel satisfied.
Overall
Vienna is a little bit over the student budget. I want to visit Vienna again with a rich budget and at that time I must spend my time in the museums, have schnitzel in a more elegant restaurant, go on the Christmas time and skate at Wiener Rathaus.
Regards, Özlem.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stepping into a real-life Christmas wonderland, Vienna in December is the place to be. From twinkling lights draped across historic buildings to the scent of mulled wine and roasted chestnuts filling the air, the city feels like something straight out of a fairy tale. I had always heard that Vienna was one of the most magical places to visit during the holiday season, but nothing prepared me for just how breathtaking it would be.
Reaching Vienna is easier than you might think. If you’re flying in, Vienna International Airport (VIE) is well-connected with flights from all over the world. From the airport, you can take the City Airport Train (CAT) which gets you to the city center in just 16 minutes. If you’re coming from a nearby European city, trains are an excellent option too, offering scenic routes through Austria’s picturesque countryside. I took a train from Munich, and as the snow-covered landscapes passed by, I knew I was in for something special.
Vienna is famous for its Christmas markets, and let me tell you, they do not disappoint. Here are a few you absolutely cannot miss:
The most iconic of them all, this market in front of Vienna’s City Hall is like something out of a holiday movie. With over 150 stalls selling handcrafted gifts, ornaments, and delicious food, it’s impossible to leave empty-handed. I grabbed a cup of Glühwein (mulled wine) and wandered through the market, soaking in the festive atmosphere.
For a more elegant setting, the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market is perfect. The backdrop of the grand palace makes everything feel even more magical. This market is ideal for finding high-quality artisan gifts and tasting traditional Austrian holiday treats.
Tucked away in narrow, cobblestone streets, this market feels cozy and intimate. It’s less touristy, making it a great spot to experience Vienna like a local. Here, I tried Kaiserschmarrn, a shredded pancake with powdered sugar and plum sauce — absolutely divine!
One of Vienna’s most famous landmarks, this Gothic cathedral looks even more stunning with Christmas lights twinkling around it. Climbing to the top rewards you with breathtaking panoramic views of the city.
Not only does this palace house Gustav Klimt’s famous painting The Kiss, but it also has its own charming Christmas market. Walking through the snow-dusted palace gardens at night was like stepping into a dream.
If you love music, you cannot leave Vienna without experiencing an opera or classical concert. I managed to get last-minute tickets to The Nutcracker, and it was pure magic. The combination of Tchaikovsky’s music and the grandeur of the opera house made it an unforgettable experience.
Vienna’s winter calls for rich, hearty dishes that warm you up from the inside. Here are a few must-try foods:
This classic Austrian dish — a breaded and fried veal cutlet — is crispy, golden, and absolutely delicious. I had mine with potato salad at Figlmüller, a restaurant famous for its schnitzel.
No trip to Vienna is complete without trying the world-famous Sacher Torte, a rich chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam. The best place to try it? Café Sacher, of course!
A warm slice of Apfelstrudel (apple strudel) with a side of vanilla sauce was the perfect dessert to enjoy at a cozy café while watching the snow fall outside.
One of the most magical moments of my trip was ice skating at the Rathausplatz Ice Rink, right in front of the beautifully illuminated City Hall. The atmosphere was electric, with Christmas music playing in the background and families gliding across the ice. I hadn’t been on skates in years, but somehow, in that moment, I felt like a kid again, completely lost in the joy of the season.
Vienna in December is more than just a destination — it’s an experience that stays with you. There’s something about the combination of history, music, food, and festive spirit that makes it feel truly special. Walking through the snow-covered streets, wrapped in my warmest coat, with the sounds of classical music drifting through the air, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and peace.
If you’re looking for a holiday getaway that feels straight out of a storybook, Vienna is the place to go. Trust me, once you experience Christmas here, you’ll want to come back every year.

The Viennese adore the River Danube. Over the centuries, they’ve depended on it for drinking water, food, and the movement of people and goods. It flows, after all, through four more capital cities before it empties into the Black Sea. On New Year’s Eve and at weddings, Austrians dance to Strauss’ joyous love song for the river, The Blue Danube waltz. Even today, the river is such a part of city life that it seems the residents believe that it runs through their back garden.
Vienna has the Danube to thank for its prosperity but, for centuries, it also lived under threat of capricious, catastrophic floods. Picture Austria and you think of mountains but the skiing capitals of Salzburg and Innsbruck are hours away by train. Vienna, home to a quarter of Austria’s 8.8 million people, sits in a geographical bowl. It’s a risky place to put a city which was, until 100 years ago, the centre of an empire. Even in the 20th century, the fear that large parts of the city could be washed away was a constraint on Vienna’s growth.
In 1988, Vienna completed its largest ever civil engineering project to address the flooding problem. Over the previous 16 years, they had dug out a new channel for the river, built two massive weirs, and piled 30 million cubic meters of soil into an island between the old and the new river. Enough soil was excavated and repurposed to cover Vienna’s largest park, the Prater, to a depth of 5 metres. It would have buried New York’s Central Park under almost 10 metres of earth. This completed Donauinsel (Danube Island) is so big that you would only have to run once around its circumference to complete a full marathon.
The construction of the Donauinsel was a project so large, requiring so much cooperation from so many different departments, that even just 31 years after its completion, it seems almost inconceivable that it could have occurred.
This is the story of how the city protected itself for the future, but also that of how the city gave its people that island as a gift.
For much of its history, Vienna perched not on the straight, steady river of today but on wetlands. Unregulated rivers flood and, in 1501, this happened cataclysmically.
The 1501 flood is as yet unmatched but as we face climate crisis, increasingly extreme summer storms and meltwater from what would previously have been freak winter snowfalls, 1501 plays on the minds of city planners. That flood destroyed bridges throughout Vienna and swept farms, orchards and livestock away. It was so destructive that, in the aftermath, Vienna’s land boundaries were completely redrawn. Landowners had lost their lives or been forced to abandon their property. For thousands of people in the city, it was time to start again.
1501 was the largest flood in Vienna’s history, but it wasn’t the last. The city lived with regular floods until the 19th century, when the Hapsburgs were at the height of their power. Famously, the emperor Franz Joseph vowed to remake the centre of Vienna. In a 30-year redevelopment project, Franz Joseph tore down the old city walls and replaced them with the Ringstrasse; a wide boulevard inspired by the streets of Paris. They erected the new Rathaus (city hall), Parliament, theatres and museums in a variety of architectural styles to give the illusion that this city-wide remodelling had happened organically, over centuries, in the context of an empire which had endured for generations and would continue for generations to come.
At the same time, Vienna’s population exploded as people came from all corners of the empire to work. In the same year the Ringstrasse was to be completed, the population was projected to break 1 million for the first time. Many of the new arrivals settled in low-lying areas of the city such as Leopoldstadt (today’s second district) and the villages of Stadtlau, Floridsdorf and Jedlsee on the other side of the Danube.
Whether the new residents knew it or not, their homes and livelihoods were in danger. The first district was on a slope, meaning that Stephansdom cathedral, the Hofburg palace, and the brand new Ringstrasse were never at risk; it was the residential districts which had to be protected if the city was to continue to prosper. We can only imagine the frustration of the Emperor who had just made over his city to his personal tastes, a man who kept lions in the garden of his summer palace and had maintained hunting ground the size of a medium sized town within the city limits, when his river wouldn’t behave.
The arrival of the telegraph in the 1840s brought some relief. With the telegraph, warning could be sent downstream from Linz when flooding was imminent. A message relayed to Vienna gave the people a days’ notice. It wasn’t much but it was enough time to protect their belongings and move to high ground instead of scrambling to the roof as the water rose around them. Understandably, the citizens continued to complain that this was not enough.
The Hapsburgs took radical action to address the problem in the 1860s and 70s. Franz Joseph enlisted the engineer behind the newly completed Suez Canal and they brought the Danube under control.
The plan was this:
First, they would build the Donaukanal (Danube Canal). The new canal would separate Leopoldstadt from the first district and run from the northern to the southern edges of the city. Thanks to the weirs and locks at the borders, the water level would remain almost constant.
Then, on the eastern side of the districts of Leopoldstadt and Brigittenau, they would carve a whole new riverbed for the Danube proper.
Finally, the old curve of the river would be set aside as the Alte Donau (Old Danube) which still exists in the 21st and 22nd districts as a haven for nature and leisure.
Instead of uncontrollable wetlands, their plan gave Vienna efficient, dependable shipping channels and a wide area which could be flooded without damage to the city.
The defences were undeniably a great feat of engineering and life in the city improved. In relative safety, Vienna grew to absorb the previously precarious villages on its outskirts. The expansion of the city continued even as the Hapsburg dynasty came to an end, even as two world wars took Vienna from the central pearl of a sprawling empire to the ‘fat head’ of a country depleted of land, resources and population.
But Franz Joseph’s defences only held for 70 years.
In 1954, another flood ravaged the new districts. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes. An outraged public demanded urgent plans for new flood protection.
Vienna reckoned with a number of solutions. Bigger dams were proposed but these would have been too dangerous were they to fail. The option of broadening the channel was discussed but making the river wider would also make it shallow, causing problems for large modern barges. Diverting the river to the north was a possibility but that area was already earmarked for development as the city recovered from the war.
Enter the Austrian engineer August Zottl, the first in his guild to occupy himself with the problem of alpine floodwaters. In 1957, when three years of calm weather had failed to dampen public interest in the project, he presented his plan to protect Vienna.
From the beginning, Zottl designed his system to cope with a flood of the same magnitude as that of 1501. His proposal was to build a second channel for the Danube parallel to the one dug in the 1870s. There would be a weir at the top of the new channel, which could be opened in the event of flooding to take pressure off the shipping channel. There would also be new motorways on the banks, which in times of absolute peril would act as an artificial flood plain in order to protect the city. And what to do with the vast amount of earth they would have to excavate? Place it between the two channels and construct an island from scratch.
Zottl’s plan was complicated, and he had to be persistent to win over the planners. It wasn’t until 15 years after his initial proposal that the city agreed to start work and, even then, the ground was broken before anyone had agreed on what to do with the new land they would create.
The Donauinsel is 21km long and 210 meters at its widest point. To the south, it extends all the way to the city’s border. To the north, it goes most of the way to the neighbouring town of Klosterneuburg. The idea of a modern city presented with such a vast new area for development was unheard of. Naturally, there were a lot of opinions on what to do with the land. Some wanted to use it for a major new train station, others a university campus, others for factories.
While building work continued, executives and planners sat in boardrooms, focussing largely on the idea of an industrial estate. On the Ringstrasse, however, crowds of people, the majority of them students, marched to demand that the new land be given to the people. It seemed like the most logical solution, they argued, since the people were using it already. In the summers of the 1970s and 80s, long before there was even a blade of grass on the island, sunbathers laid out their towels on the gravel and spent the day lying under the cranes.
In spite of complaints that their demand was ‘communist,’ the protesters won. Not only would the people have access to the whole island, it would be free and without fences. No private clubs. No golf courses. No industry. Just a vast space for recreation.
Today, three of Vienna’s five underground lines have stations either on the Donauinsel or the riverbank, so that the people can reach it directly from most of the city. On the island, you’ll find everything from the world’s biggest floating trampoline complex to a wakeboard lift, Saturday morning kite festivals to Vienna’s Muggle Quidditch team. There’s a grammar school built on a boat moored to the island and a number of beaches reserved just for dogs. There are pontoons from which people jump into the new river channel and swim to the other side. There’s a playpark with a stream running through it where kids build muddy sandcastles in the middle of their landlocked country. In the more secluded parts of the island, there are also nudist beaches.
Every year since 1984 (four years before it was officially completed), the island has played host to Donauinselfest, a music festival that calls itself the biggest free outdoor party in Europe. Big-name acts travel from around the world to play to almost 3 million visitors. Most years, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra also puts in an appearance.
Vienna continues to invest in the Dounauinsel too. Wi-Fi is now available on a large part of the island, allowing people to work in the fresh air. The island is home to 1.8 million trees and, now they are established, projects are being undertaken to maximise the space as a habitat for diverse wildlife. Community gardens are also increasingly popular. Just last year, the city gardeners planted an orchard of 30 fruit trees. Anyone is welcome to harvest the fruit, provided they take only as much as they can hold in their hands.
Most happily, Zottl’s flood defence plan was such a success that a great deal of Vienna’s population is unaware of the critical role the Donauinsel plays. On average, the weir is opened twice a year so the new channel can take the extra water. The biggest test of the system came in July 2013 when overwhelming storms hit the Danube basin. Vienna experienced more than two months’ worth of rainfall in two days. The Donauinsel was partially flooded but, while towns such as Passau were devastated by the worst floods since 1501, Vienna was undamaged.
The Danube hasn’t flowed through the centre of Vienna since the Donaukanal was first constructed. Bratislava castle is built on a rock overlooking the water. The famous Hungarian Parliament building sits on the water too, as does the whole of Old Belgrade. In Vienna, however, you have to walk for several kilometres to get from the first district to the river. You can’t see the cathedral from the water, or Karlskirche, or the Opera, or the Riesenrad Ferris wheel.
But while the Danube doesn’t run past Vienna’s most famous tourist attractions, it does go through the area where people actually live. The turbulent history of Vienna and its river was never a struggle to protect its crown jewels, its religious artefacts, its palaces. It was about saving people’s homes and their ability to put down roots without fear that they would be washed away.
Now that the flood risk is mitigated, the river is more important than ever to the Viennese as part of their life outside work, although it could be argued that an island wrought by all the might of 20th century engineering technology is a surreal place to to withdraw from the pace of urban life. Though visitors know that the island is still new, the trees have grown and the paths have weathered to the extent that the island no longer feels man made. Most importantly, if you take a bike and cycle for 20 minutes, you can only see the city in the distance. To be within the borders of a European capital and yet have it be so easy to escape is a gift.
In 1988, when the Donauinsel was opened, it was estimated that 100,000 people a day would visit. 30 years later, in a city of only 2 million people, you’ll find 2–300 000 of them somewhere on the island when the sun comes out. Beer in a cooler, someone cycling up and down the footpaths selling ice cream, sun cream (hopefully) applied, the Viennese still love nothing more than a day in the fresh air by the water. And, on days like that, it must be said that the river is, quite astonishingly, blue.

Grateful for those who speak English while we study German
St Stephen’s Cathedral on a gray February day- Author photo
I’m not so sanguine about writing here on Medium-using just my iPad, not really sure where to publish. I comment a lot. For those who follow my comments, you might notice a wide range of subjects.
My wife and I rented an apartment in the 18th district of Vienna starting November of 2024. This came about from a desire to leave the US and certain business opportunities in Austria. We have been catching up to the process of moving while in the middle of several projects, including listing our home for sale on the East coast of FL. This required more time than we expected, and delayed our move until two weeks ago.
As soon as we arrived in Vienna, we left for Cyprus to attend a course and visit some friends. So we have actually been in the apartment for about six days. We ordered a nice mattress from SchlafTEQ right before we left for Cyprus, and they got it to us when we returned. So that’s our furniture until our container arrives in four more weeks.
We managed to buy a washer/dryer Monday, which arrived yesterday, just in time to start washing our clothes. Of course it is small compared to the monster LG units we had in Florida. It also takes two or three hours to process a load. But the clothes come out beautifully clean.
We were in the first district of Vienna yesterday, running errands, looking at furniture to complement what is coming by container. We stopped into the luxury grocery store, Julius Meinl, to buy a few items, and the cashier sarcastically commented to the patrons behind us: “tourists,” as we fumbled for unfamiliar coins. Not sure what she expects from the first district, which sees millions of tourists a year.
And we are newbie ex-pats, or maybe even immigrants, working our way through the challenges of culture, language and a new location. So it’s on us to adapt, to be respectful. To learn the language, and to accommodate the changes with grace. We are so grateful that we speak English, and that so many Viennese, especially the younger ones, speak it so well.
We ae both very excited to be here, and a bit overwhelmed by no furniture, new language, cold weather and an unfamiliar neighborhood. Almost everyone we meet, when we explain to that we came from Florida asks “But why would you move here?” Not knowing how the US has become a place of strife, bad food, unkind culture, a insanely expensive medical system and a waste of resources.
Not that I do not have great respect for the good things in the US, and there are many; it is that life, for us, even with all the challenges here, offers all of the elements in Vienna that please us-food, culture, an enticing city, public transport, and ultimately a real community. We are also very happy that Vienna is such a great hub to explore all of the EU and beyond.

All great cities lay claim to at least one golden moment. While we might quibble over what’s required to earn that label, one thing seems clear: Fabled destiny often coexists with searing contradictions.
Vienna in 1900 was a perfect example.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the imperial city of the ruling Hapsburgs and Europe’s cosmopolitan center of music and pleasure. It was home to Sigmund Freud and the two Gustavs of music and art (Mahler and Klimt ), a pantheon of poets, composers, literati, and theater notables; a yeasty mix of immigrants from throughout the sprawling Austro-Hungarian empire; the sixth largest Jewish population in the world; and plentiful parks, palaces, coffee houses, and heart-stopping pastries.
Yet as Stefan Zweig (1881–1942) — Vienna’s native son, member of the city’s Jewish bourgeoisie, and famed author — understood well, Vienna’s underbelly was in ferment. Suicide was rampant. So, too, were syphilis, cholera, tuberculosis, and typhoid. Infant mortality was high and life expectancy low at a mere 38 years. Anti-Semitism was also on the rise as was the disaffection of youth, shackled by rules and norms governing every aspect of life.
With the help of Zweig’s 1942, 450-page autobiography, aptly titled The World of Yesterday, here are some keen observations of this…

Visiting Vienna is like taking a step back through time. The imposing architecture, glamorous cafe’s, expansive beer halls, and slow, relaxed pace of life make visitors feel as if they are living in a black and white film. While there is certainly a modern element that vibrates through the metro area — particularly during commuting hours — , Vienna generally runs on a pulse that syncs to the slow, steady chime of the church bells that ring throughout the city every hour on the hour. This ambient environment combined with delicious cuisine and a rich culture attract millions of visitors to Vienna every year.
There is so much to see and do, one could easily spend an entire day roaming around each of the uniquely beautiful districts, discovering all the hidden gems that Vienna has to offer. If, however, you are limited to spending only a few days in the city, here are a few tips from a local on how to hit the highlights while still having an authentic, Viennese experience.
Walk the Ringstrasse
Many of the most popular sites lie along the two and a half-mile epicenter of the city — the Ringstrasse. While many visitors take the seven-euro tourist tram ride to view all the architecture in rapid succession, the best way to fully appreciate these magnificent buildings is to pass them slowly and on foot. I suggest starting at the Schottentor metro station and strolling down toward the Rathaus and around. Here is a post that highlights many of the more significant landmarks you will pass along the way. Once you make it all the way around and are back near Schottentor, pop into the Melker Stiftskeller restaurant/wine cellar for dinner or a late lunch. The cuisine is true authentic Austrian — that is, packed with salt, heavy cream, and every other sinful ingredient that is a treat for the taste buds. A large Schnitzel and a few pilsner beers are just the things to revive you after your walk.
Buy Lunch at Naschmarkt and Picnic at Schloss Schonbrunn
On a Saturday morning, Naschmarkt — an open-air farmer’s market — will be packed with people buying fruits, vegetables, and exotic treats like olives, hummus, and freshly fried falafel. While you likely won’t want or need to stock up on groceries during your stay­, you should absolutely sample some of the goodies on sale at Naschmarkt. I suggest purchasing a smorgasbord of picnic supplies and hopping on the metro to Schloss Schonbrunn. You can enter the surrounding park for free, find a bench or a grassy spot, and enjoy lunch among the beautifully groomed gardens. Afterward, you may consider touring the inside of the castle.
Have Coffee at a Viennese Café
Café culture is an integral part of Viennese history. During its golden era after World War I and before World War II, many Viennese aristocrats made their fortunes by importing sugar for the pastries that lined the café display cases. As a result, many coffee houses around the city are now protected UNESCO world heritage sites. A visit to the city would not be complete without a Mélange and an Apfelstrudel or Sachertorte in one of these famed cafes. Places like Café Central, while very beautiful, are typically packed with tourists. It may be worth battling the crowds to check out the interior decor, but it won’t be quite the authentic experience you might be looking for. To fully enjoy the “public living rooms of Vienna” in a more relaxed setting, head somewhere that is slightly less popular but every bit as beautiful. I suggest checking out Cafe Sperl or Café Schwarzenberg.
Visit Klimt at the Belvedere
There are many art museums in Vienna, and if you are an art buff, you’ll probably want to visit more than just one. But if you only have a few days, the must-visit museum is absolutely the Belvedere. The building and surrounding gardens are a work of art in themselves and the museum houses paintings by Vienna’s most beloved artist, Gustav Klimt. His most famous work, The Kiss, is to Austria what the Guernica is to Spain or The Statue of David is to Florence. After your visit to the museum, hop on the D line street train (Strassenbahn) heading west and find your way to 7 Stern Bräu for a krügerl (pint-ish) of traditionally brewed beer.
Hike in the Viennese Vineyards
Vienna may be well known for its beer production, but it also produces enough wine to imbibe the entire city. Just outside the city, visitors can sample Viennese wine and hike around centuries-old vineyards that are still producing today. There are over 190 Vinters scattered in the foothills outside the city and dozens of restaurants where you can enjoy seasonal cuisine featuring fresh greens, mushrooms, or berries that are harvested from the nearby forest. Check out this post with a few recommended locations and spend the day drinking your way from winery to winery.
Vienna has so much more to offer, and as a newly minted local, I am constantly discovering places worthy of this list. However, if you only have a few days in the city, these recommended activities will ensure you experience some of the touristic highlights while having an authentic Viennese experience.

I went on a Workation to Vienna and that’s how it was,https://chris-krammer.medium.com/i-went-on-a-workation-to-vienna-and-thats-how-it-was-9235c8b694dc,"Sign up

My first ever Workation I went on to Vienna was actually quite a lame experience. But let me start from the beginning.
I’m from Austria, so I figured why not go to its capital Vienna for a test run and see how such a trip might turn out, if I packed in everything I thought I need and if the travel bag I already owned would be enough (hint: it wasn’t, it didn’t have wheels and so I almost ruined my back and shoulder with all the stuff I brought with me). Furthermore, my sister is living in Vienna and so what could go wrong, having her around.
Now thinking back, I see that I even made some Workations before that time before even knowing what that is. I just visited my sister in her apartment, brought some cloths and my laptop with me, and spend a good time with her. I think at this time the word Workation wasn’t even invented yet and so I’m tempted to say that I was one of the pioneers of this movement.
To get a primer on Workations please check this article.
Now back to my first “real” Workation: There are a couple of reasons why it was such a failure. For one, I chose a pretty bad Airbnb. It was my first time on this platform and so I wasn’t that experienced yet. On the photos everything looked pretty nice, but then arriving at the apartment all the niceness was suddenly gone. The place was quite run down for a rather high price and it was on the tiny side. At least it had everything I needed: A bed to sleep, a couch to sit at, a table to work, and a kitchen to cook — all crammed into a tiny apartment, unfortunately.
Actually, the first day was quite enjoyable. It was a holiday, so I had the whole day to walk around, explore the city, and check what I could do in the neighborhood in the next days. My first goal was to get breakfast and I found this lovely place with a good selection of food. But this wasn’t the best part: I went out on this Workation to meet people and to have some lucky encounters, which strangely happened on the first day right away, basically in the first hours of the trip. There was this elder guy sitting next to me who saw that I was reading on my iPad and approached me about his own device which he seemed to have problems with.
But that was only a small part of the conversation in the end. It turned out that he was a cook, and a pretty famous one who had travelled the world pursuing his passion and meeting quite some celebrities while doing that (Schwarzenegger, anyone?). It must have been at least one hour while I listened to him — and the breakfast was good too.
And then reality kicked in. I vividly remember the first working day of my Workation: It was the first day after a long weekend and so I not only had more than enough to catch up with but there was also the “added stress” of being in a totally unfamiliar place, without the usual work gear, no breakfast bought yet, me sitting in this tiny room (which neither was beneficial to my motivation nor inspiration). And to add to that, I also needed to figure out what to do in Vienna. I mean, I was in this awesome city without a plan what to do or where to go. Oh boy, I still get the goose bumps when thinking about this moment …
Another reason why I didn’t enjoy this Workation at first was that I wasn’t ready yet to see all the possibilities of such a trip, working in different places and not sitting in the apartment all day (as I’m anyway doing it at home too, so what’s the point?). Unfortunately, this didn’t change much until I went home again, but it at least gave me a glimpse of what such a trip could actually mean — and I learned a lot from it and did much, much better on my second Workation. I’ll tell you about it another article, stay tuned!
I need to admit that the weather also wasn’t in my favor and so it must have been the third day or so where I finally took the courage and went out to have breakfast and I was so bold to take my work gear with me. Unfortunately, I didn’t have much experience with that yet and the MacBook I had at this time didn’t last very long and the external battery was lame too (and surely there was no power plug nearby). So I ended up having a call with a colleague on the iPad which was also close to being out of power. At least the breakfast I had was delicious, it was a mixture of Indian food I had never tasted before with some Turkish coffee I also hadn’t experienced so far. And then there was sunshine, a lot.
I made all the mistakes you shouldn’t make when being on a Workation but despite all the challenges I tried it again the other day and sat in a cafè near the riverside of the river Danube that flows though Vienna. It must be lovely here in the summer — and it was also the first time when I realized how nasty direct sunlight on a laptop screen can be. But it was still an enjoyable experience, sitting outside, having a lot of people around you, being able to order some cool drinks and freeing your mind in the fresh air.
What I did pretty well on this Workation in Vienna was to explore the city in my free time — I couldn’t wait until I finished work (which was usually quite late, as I stressed out a lot and got less work done than I wanted) to walk around, which I did a lot. I think there must have been no place in the city center that I didn’t see. And I ate a lot of good food, which Vienna is famous for, like Wiener Schnitzel or Gulasch, and drank some good local beer. Then there was also the time I spent with my sister, she even managed to show me some spots I didn’t see before and took me out to an exhibition of Keith Haring in the “Wiener Albertina,” a famous museum.
All in all, my first Workation wasn’t the experience I was looking for and surely not the best prerequisite to go on more such trips. But it didn’t hold me back from going on another similar trip just a month later, that I had already booked and was very excited about (Trieste, Italy, to be precise). It also taught me to plan well on one side, to prevent mental overload when being in an uncommon location, but at the same time be spontaneous and appreciate all the opportunities you have in such a city.
Most of all, it allowed me to see how important it is to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself. I had these awesome possibilities as a former employee of Alludo and it would have been nothing short of stupid to not use them and enjoy the given freedom as much as I could.
If nothing else, the trip to Vienna helped me to see what I may have forgotten to pack and in which mistakes I should not repeat again, so it was a useful lesson how NOT to do a Workation. And that alone helped me to enjoy my future trips even more, so I tried to see the positive sides as much as I could. It also made me realize that there is nothing in life that doesn’t happen or a reason.
Would you also like to go on a Workation and avoid the same mistakes I made? I’d love to help you make this trip into an unforgettable experience. Check out my feed on Instagram and send me a message.

At least its not Bratislava
We went to Vienna mid-August of 2019. I’ve been there previously two years ago but now we opted to go together. As you’ll no doubt discover we’re both passive-ish tourists. Not that we won’t be out for the entire day when we’re abroad but often our days would start past 12pm and we’ll find ourselves taking an Uber rather than running since 6am with five backpacks. Maybe that’s to come in a few years but for now its comfortable beds all the way.
It’s not everyone’s cup of tea but if you’re into arts, Baroque European architecture and a strudel or two then its the place to be. Unlike places like Rome or Paris, Vienna doesn’t suffer from swarms of tourism. Don’t get me wrong it’s not dead on the streets but if you’re used to lining up for 6 hours to get into The Colosseum you will be pleasantly surprised having to wait 10 or so minutes to get into most major attractions.
So what about museums? There are plenty of those. I had a leaflet that listed 50 or so but I looked it up and there are a 100 plus. You can pick what you’d like from Royal apartments, natural history or horses there is plenty for everyone apart from people who don’t like museums. If that’s you then go to the Film Museum as its closed for the summer.
Since Vienna is in Austria and Austria is German you can’t avoid the art college crowd. Thankfully they keep to themselves here and only provide Vienna with modern art and overpriced food. If you would like to spend 25 euros on a porridge and a smoothie Ilona would recommend Superfood Deli.
The entire city centre is littered with good shops from the fanciest H&M building to your average Saint Laurent. There is also a very large shopping street slightly outside the centre for more regular things like Esprit and mymuesli.
However if you want IQOS cigarettes like Ilona then you will have to take a train to Bratislava (which we did).
Vienna has one of the most reliable Metro systems we’ve been to. For 17 euros you can get an unlimited travel pass for a week (7 days). This includes the metro, trams, buses, all that stuff. Everything is very well connected. Vienna also has Uber and Uber with Lime integration. That’s their electric scooters. There are also other brands that do the scooter service but we use Uber so here we are.
Vienna has the first Hard Rock cafe we tried in Europe that wasn’t greasy. And to be honest with the most polite staff too. Plachuttas Gasthaus zur Oper is another great place, we went for Schnitzel. For amazing Apple Strudel a good place to go would be Residence Cafe and Restaurant which is right next to Schönbrunn Palace. Sacher cake is also a must try! Ok it’s just chocolate cake but its a really really good chocolate cake.
What if you realise 25 euro porridge is not your cup of tea? What do you do then? You run to your nearest Billa supermarket and grab a poppy seed Strudel to fill you up with goodness.
You can also find your usual Spar and a re-branded Aldi but you won’t have to make that hard choice as all places are always well stocked with good food that’s well priced. Also they have some great sausages.
Honorable mention: I got a muesli with milk and a yogurt, both were under 80 cents.
This time we got an AirBNB. It was perfect. Was hosted by a lovely chap called Christian, who was more enthusiastic than most hotel staff I encountered. The apartment was 3min from one of the main shopping streets and metro and we slept with the windows open because it was so quiet.
We give Vienna a solid 9/10
Ok bye thank you.

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

Living in the world’s most liveable city comes with its own challenges! Vienna is one of the best cities in the world, however, it has lots of space for improvement — especially when it comes to digitalization.
Austrians love their Euro bills and coins and won’t replace them completely with digital payment solutions anytime soon. More and more businesses are adapting to the digital movement, however, you can’t leave the house completely without Cash. You always need to think about carrying some Euros with you as money businesses still require you to pay in cash.After talking to some business owners we agreed that there is only one main reason for the slow adaption:
High commissions for digital payments and it’s not sustainable for businesses to allow customers to pay lower amounts with cards. Business owners pay a fixed rate of 25 cents to 45 cents per transaction PLUS a percentage of the transaction sum. It totally makes sense from a business point of view to allow card payments only for bigger transactions.
Once we started traveling a lot we started to appreciate these long opening hours in other countries. Shops in Austria are only open 6 days a week from around 7 AM to 8 PM and are closed on Sundays. When I say closed, I mean completely closed. No grocery shopping on Sundays and Holidays. There are some exceptions at main train stations and airports, but these are crowded and aren’t really meant for regular shopping.
If you’re moving to Vienna, coming from a country with strong small-talk culture, you might experience the holy private space of Viennese quite early.Privacy is one of the most important assets here in Vienna and you don’t exchange this information with strangers. Like many other topics, it has its pros and cons, and there is no right or wrong. However, that’s something that I’m missing here in Vienna. I’m originally from Iran and small talk is part of our culture. Talking to strangers without invading their personal space is totally normal, which is in most cases a very nice experience and it’s boosting your mood automatically. Of course, there are also negative experiences but I think in general it’s a good thing and is more a cultural thing, so it can’t be adapted that fast.
The older you get the more complicated it gets to meet with your friends or loved ones. That’s why I’m a big fan of flexibility and spontaneity. Meeting loved ones shouldn’t become rocket science and you should be able to meet them whenever you feel the desire. Everybody is or acts super busy and opens their online calendar when you want to schedule an appointment. That’s maybe a point which most people don’t consider as a problem, but I think you only realize it once you experienced the opposite. Planning is healthy and everybody should do a little bit of planning, but don’t forget to live the moments and make space for some flexibility. If you’re a spontaneous person feel free to be a good example when living in Vienna :)
If you’re a handy person and love repairing your fridge, washing machine, pipes, and other home projects, then this point is not for you. But if you’re like me and have two left hands and need help to repair all of these things, then Vienna will welcome you with very high costs.To give you an example: The ice-maker of our fridge is broken for two years now and tried to fix it with YouTube videos, but didn’t succeed yet. So the problem is not that I’m greedy and don’t want to spend 100–150 euros to repair it. The main problem is that at the beginning you don’t really get a clear picture of the upcoming costs, because you pay only 100 € for the technician to arrive and have a look at the root cause. If you’re lucky the technician finds the root cause and replaces it for you right away. But if not, you could end up paying around 500€ for new parts and replacement costs. Labor is very expensive in Austria and it has the effect that many people try to repair everything by themselves, which has a nice side effect. You get handier and gain new experiences :)
We have also a YouTube Video on the same topic! Feel free to watch it and let us know in the comments below what annoys you most about your city.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that, so we took a train from Bratislava to Vienna. The ride was only 60 minutes long, and both of us took the opportunity to read. I was close to finishing Atlas Shrugged and wanted to savor the final pages. Sitting next to Caroline, I was able to do that. Somehow, the silence we shared during that ride was just as romantic as the previous night. Neither of us needed to fill the air with words just for the sake of it. That’s a quality I love in not just women, but all people. Being able to shut the fuck up shows a security in one’s self.
The train station wasn’t far from the downtown area of the city, so we walked around to look for a hostel. We had no luck. When we finally got too tired to carry our bags, we stopped in a bar. We drank whatever the bartender suggested, some local beer I’m sure. That part alludes me. I usually remember what I drink in every bar. I won’t be able to tell you who was there with me, but I almost always know what I was drinking. What I do remember though, is that David Hasselhoff’s music was playing the entire time. I hated it from the jump, but had no clue who the artist was.
“What is this garbage we’re listening to?” I asked Caroline.
“It’s David Hasselhoff.”
“That’s crazy! In America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch.”
“Are you being serious right now?” She asked, incredulously.
“Yeah, the same exact name.”
“IT’S THE SAME PERSON, YOU DODO.”
“Wait, so he’s a musician too?”
“This is blowing my mind,” she said. “He’s like the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He has more than 20 albums.”
“Ok, now you’re blowing my mind.”
“And, we have Baywatch in Australia too. I don’t live on the moon.”
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. The fact remains though, that shit was painful to listen to. His music sounds like a knock off of Depeche Mode, but more robotic and cheesy. Luckily, while sitting at the bar, we met a few fellow backpackers. You can find the answers to most problems in a bar. You can find the causes too. They were nice enough to walk us over to the nearby hostel they were staying at. Fortunately, there were rooms available.
It was one of the nicest hostels I’d seen up until that point. There were multiple recreation areas, along with a courtyard that had one of those chessboards with foot-tall pieces. I taught Caroline chess there. The kitchen was really nice too. There were even nice wooden tables to sit at while we enjoyed the free breakfast provided each day. It was a nice change from having to eat standing up. The only thing they didn’t have was a bar, otherwise it was perfect.
I finished my book that afternoon in the courtyard while sitting next to Caroline. I felt emotional putting it down for the last time. By then the pages were completely worn down and both covers were gone. It looked like it had been through a war, and maybe it had, considering it was a late 60’s edition that I’d bought near Washington Square Park a few months prior.
I’d already finished all of Ayn Rand’s books at that point and needed more words to burn through. Instead of reading though, I decided to write some letters. I’d bought some cool, vintage airmail envelopes (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border) in Amsterdam and really wanted to use them. I got some paper there too. For me, at the time, it was all about thin paper. Whenever I found it I had to buy it. I wanted the stuff as thin as a newspaper. I also knew I’d potentially write a book about the trip one day and wanted some documentation. I made copies of the letters by hand before sending them.
Caroline and I weren’t staying in the same room that night, so when I was done writing I said goodnight and went to bed. It was the earliest I’d gone to bed throughout the whole trip.
The next day, I woke up and took a walk by myself. I just wanted to explore and enjoy the nice spring weather, no plans at all. Again, museums were out of the question, so I just popped some Adderall and let my feet guide me. I could wander for miles on Adderall. I could do anything for hours on it really.
After a bit, I found myself in an outdoor shopping mall. While I was window shopping I faintly heard the sound of the Wu-Tang Clan song Triumph playing in a nearby store. When I looked to my right, it all made sense. It was a skate shop. I entered looking like one of the Goonies after they found One-Eyed Willy’s dabloons.
A guy who worked there was standing in the doorway. I said to him,“You have no clue how good it feels to hear Wu out in the wild. I’m from America and damn have I been missing hip hop. I thought all you guys played in this country was David Hasselhoff.”
“Haha, we listen to other stuff,” he told me, in better English than I expected.
“I’m going to a Raekwon show in Amsterdam next week.”
“Really?!”
“Yeah, I was already there a couple weeks ago, but I can’t miss this show. Plus, I need to buy more weed.”
“I can sell you some.”
I told you, drugs come to me.
I paid him 60 Euros for a quarter ounce of above par weed, and he gave it to me right in the store. I thought about buying some Nike Dunks as a good gesture, but thought otherwise after seeing the prices. I never understood people who spend all of their money on shoes. Then again, I spend all my money on weed, so…
We shook hands and said goodbye.
“If I ever come back to Vienna, this will be my first stop.”
“Cheers.”
When I returned to the Hostel, Caroline was there.
“What’s up lady?” I asked, playfully.
“I heard about a good bar that’s in walking distance. Some guy over there told me about it. He described it as weird and completely empty.”
“Perfect.”
“It is, right?”
“I meant you. You’re just perfect.”
“Aww, you make me blush, John McEnroe.”
“Please…”
The bar was everything the guy said it was. It looked more like an empty Chili’s than a bar. There were way too many booths, and the bar only sat 6. Normally, I’d sit at the bar in that situation but Caroline didn’t want to take the chance of getting stuck with an English speaking ex-pat blabber of a bartender.
Beers turned into Sambuca shots very quickly. She was the one ordering this time, and I was certain she was trying to ply me with enough liquor so I’d finally make a move on her. Obviously, it worked. A man can only be so strong, even the best ones.
We disappeared one after the other into the men’s bathroom, as to deceive the bartender into thinking it was a normal bathroom run. Again, very Danny Ocean of me.
We started kissing as soon as she opened the door. Then I put her on top of the sink and… Well, the rest I’ll leave to your imagination.
After a few minutes of fun, we fixed our clothes and left the bathroom. I can’t be sure of the reason but as soon as the bartender saw us, he asked us to pay our tab and leave. As I told you before, being asked to leave is way different than being thrown out.
We kissed and fondled each other on the walk back to the hostel. I hadn’t experienced that since college. I don’t know if there’s anything better then a fondle walk. It really makes you feel like a teenager again.
When we got to the hostel, we sat and chatted before going to bed.
“I think I want to go to Germany tomorrow. Do you want to come with?” I asked her.
“I don’t think so. I want to stay here longer and see museums.”
She was doing what I did to her, making me wait.
“I understand.”
We hugged, then stared at each other, our arms still intertwined. Neither of us needed words to express what we felt. We spent five magical days together. It didn’t need to be anything more than that. We were both content.
“Goodnight, pretty lady.”
“Goodnight, Mr. McEnroe. See you when I see you.”

The Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics: Distinctions and Parallels in Vienna’s Intellectual Landscape,https://medium.com/@JoshuaDGlawson/the-vienna-circle-and-the-austrian-school-of-economics-distinctions-and-parallels-in-viennas-29187e19089e,"Sign up

Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a vibrant center of intellectual activity, nurturing diverse schools of thought that would leave a lasting impact on philosophy, economics, and the social sciences.
Two of the most significant intellectual movements to emerge from this environment were the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics.
While both were products of the same cultural milieu, they differed significantly in their objectives, methodologies, and areas of focus. However, they also shared certain parallels that make their comparison intriguing.
The Vienna Circle emerged in the early 20th century, primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, as a group of philosophers and scientists committed to the development of logical positivism (or logical empiricism). Their main concern was the logical analysis of scientific knowledge, with a focus on distinguishing between meaningful and meaningless statements. They sought to apply rigorous logical and mathematical methods to philosophy, with the goal of eliminating metaphysics and focusing on empirically verifiable statements.
Key figures in the Vienna Circle included Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath, who collectively aimed to create a unified scientific language grounded in empirical evidence. The Vienna Circle was particularly influenced by philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ernst Mach, David Hume, and logicians like Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Their work laid the foundation for much of 20th-century analytic philosophy.
In contrast, the Austrian School of Economics originated in the late 19th century with Carl Menger, whose 1871 work Principles of Economics introduced the concept of marginal utility. This school focused on economics, emphasizing individual human action, subjective value, and the limitations of central planning.
Unlike the Vienna Circle, which was preoccupied with logical analysis and the philosophy of science, the Austrian School concentrated on understanding market processes, capital theory, and the dynamics of economic systems.
Prominent figures of the Austrian School included Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek. Their work contributed to key economic concepts such as praxeology (the study of human action), critiques of socialism, and the importance of price signals in a market economy.
One of the most significant distinctions between the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics lies in their respective methodologies.
The Vienna Circle championed logical empiricism and verificationism. They believed that the meaning of a statement could only be established if it could be empirically verified or if it was a tautology in logic. This focus on empirical verification and the rejection of metaphysics led them to develop complex systems of logical analysis and to apply the methods of the natural sciences to philosophical problems.
In contrast, the Austrian School relied on methodological individualism and deductive reasoning from basic axioms, particularly the principle of human action, known as praxeology. Austrian economists were skeptical of applying mathematical models and empirical methods to economics, as they believed that such methods could not fully capture the complexities of human behavior and market processes. Instead, they emphasized theoretical analysis based on logical deductions from fundamental principles of human action.
The differences between the two schools also extended to their views on science and knowledge.
The Vienna Circle sought to unify the sciences through a common logical framework. They believed that by applying the methods of logic and mathematics, it was possible to create a precise language for science, free from the ambiguities of everyday language. Their goal was to reduce all scientific knowledge to a set of logical propositions that could be verified through empirical observation.
The Austrian School, on the other hand, was more skeptical of the application of scientific methods to economics. While they valued knowledge and understanding of economic processes, they argued that economics was fundamentally different from the natural sciences because it dealt with human behavior, which could not be predicted or measured with the same precision as physical phenomena. Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek argued that economics required a different approach — one that recognized the limits of knowledge and the role of individual decision-making in shaping economic outcomes.
Despite these differences, there were also notable parallels between the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics, particularly in their skepticism of central planning and authority.
Both schools were critical of grand metaphysical systems and authoritarian approaches to knowledge or governance.
The Vienna Circle sought to dismantle traditional philosophical systems that relied on untestable assertions, advocating instead for a form of empiricism that demanded evidence and logical consistency.
Similarly, the Austrian School critiqued centralized economic planning and interventionism, arguing that such approaches were based on flawed assumptions about the ability to predict and control complex economic systems.
Friedrich Hayek’s work, in particular, echoed some of the Vienna Circle’s concerns about the dangers of overconfidence in human knowledge. His famous critique of socialism emphasized the impossibility of central planners having sufficient information to manage an economy effectively — a view that resonated with the Vienna Circle’s insistence on empirical verification and skepticism of grandiose claims.
Ultimately, while the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics both emerged from Vienna’s rich intellectual environment, their legacies diverged significantly.
The Vienna Circle’s influence was most strongly felt in the fields of philosophy, particularly in the development of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of science. Their ideas about logical analysis, the rejection of metaphysics, and the emphasis on empirical verification shaped much of 20th-century philosophical thought.
The Austrian School of Economics, meanwhile, became one of the leading schools of economic thought, particularly in its critiques of socialism and advocacy for free markets. Figures like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek continued to shape economic theory and policy debates, particularly in the context of discussions about the role of government in the economy.
While the Vienna Circle and the Austrian School of Economics operated in different intellectual spheres, they shared a common context in the rich intellectual environment of Vienna. Both schools were skeptical of grand systems and central planning, yet they diverged in their methodologies, objectives, and areas of focus.
The Vienna Circle sought to apply the methods of logic and science to philosophical problems, while the Austrian School emphasized the importance of individual human action and the limitations of scientific methods in understanding economics.
Together, they represent two distinct yet parallel threads in the intellectual history of Vienna, each leaving a lasting impact on their respective fields.

“HEAVEN, VIENNA MINE, LAUGHTER AND MUSIC AND STARS THAT SHINE, WONDERFUL CITY WHERE I BELONG, OF HER I SING MY SONG”[VIENNA, CITY OF MY DREAMS, RUDOLF SIECZYNSKI]
by Anja Mayer
Vienna, as one of the most vibrant cultural hotspots in Europe, has for centuries been home to many artists, composers, thinkers and poets from all corners of the continent. Over the years, the city’s lively intellectual and artistic scene, and unique culture has served as a catalyst for creative processes and exchanges, that left an impact all over the world. Besides being the birthplace of revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of psychology, literature and the arts, Vienna especially had an important influence on the evolution of classical music.
From 1780 until 1824, a period which is sometimes also referred to as the Viennese Classics, composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Josef Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven revolutionized the European music scene. It was during that time that music evolved from background entertainment during social gatherings to a highly respected cultural form of art with an even higher social significance, earning Vienna the reputation as the capital of composition. Since then many more accomplished composers, musicians and artist have emerged from the city’s cultural scene onto the world stage.
To salute Vienna’s unique and extraordinary musical legacy, the Carnegie Hall in New York City will host a three-week citywide festival in the spring of 2014. The event will feature symphonic and operatic masterpieces, chamber music and a variety of new music that is emerging from the Austrian capital. The central piece of the festival is a concert series by the renowned Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Their residency, which will include seven concert performances, will mark only the second time in history that the Viennese musicians have performed opera in concert at Carnegie Hall. The festival will extend throughout New York City and will feature other musical highlights such as Beethoven’s violin sonata cycle, Schubert’s Die schöne Müllerin and the premiere of new work by Austrian composer Georg Friedrich Haas. Apart from concert performances, the celebration will combine a variety of art disciplines including film screenings and art exhibitions at different cultural venues throughout the city. The kick-off event of the festival will be the annual traditional Viennese Opera Ball at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on February 21, 2014.

Vienna is a beautiful city, with significant uniqe baroque architectures. Vienna is one of my favorite cities. Additionally, Vienna is classified as the best living place for years.
As the name itself suggest that the castle has vivid and beautiful colors, that give a great idea of the life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This castle has a very green garden, with a huge plant labyrinth. There is a very famous story about this castle and especially about the plant labyrinth. The story is about a stunning empress Sissi, and her assassination.
On your way out of the castle, I would prefer you to visit the Tiergarten ( the zoo). The Zoo has many exotic and interesting animals. The workers in the zoo as well make extreamly interesting shows with the animals.

“My dream writing room would be the Imperial Library in Vienna.” Fran Lebowitz
The word “cosy” means different things to different people. For some, it’s sipping a cup of chai in the comfort of home. For others, it’s watching your favorite series without interruptions. It might be talking to friends or family about something meaningful, or spending quality time with loved ones. In other words, it’s that moment when you’re truly yourself — when you’re not bound by any obligation, when you’re quietly loving yourself, and when you’re living, not just existing.
I try to find these cosy moments in my home, and today that moment came while painting a memory from Vienna. The art is far from perfect and still incomplete. The art is inspired from a church which was across our apartment in Vienna. I snapped a photo, thinking that one day I might paint it. Today, I finally did. When you visit a city, you carry it with you forever and Vienna is that city for me. Isn’t is beautiful you need not pay money to be an artist or a writer. Your own memories are enough. All you need is a pen and a paper and you keep doing it again and again as if that’s how you will attain salvation.
I’ll take my time with this. Watercolor isn’t my favorite medium, but I will try to do my best to paint the memory.
February Weeds & Wildflowers Writing Prompt is Cosy. Sharing today’s memory for the same. Thanks to the editors of Weeds and Wildflowers publication for the space for my rambling.

Vienna is a thriving cultural hub with beautiful architecture and fascinating history. It was also named the “World’s Most Livable City” by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
That’s why I recently packed my bags and moved to Vienna. I wanted to see if the city lived up to the hype. And sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.
Here are my first impressions of Vienna:
While wandering the streets of Vienna, a street food stall caught my eye. I decided I would try some traditional Austrian food. Not knowing a lot of German or Austrian cuisine, I pointed to what I thought looked tasty.
“Käsekrainer” the man said.
“Danke schön (Thank you),” I replied.
He handed me a plate with the largest sausage I had ever seen in my life, cut up into small pieces. Then, he gave me a slice of bread and some ketchup on the side.

Vienna ooo nah nah, half of our heart is in Vienna ooo nah nah. 🎵
Leaving Santorini was an event — the airport was not built to support multiple departing flights and has the worst airport logistics we’ve ever seen in our lives! In short, it was chaotic, people were shoving, kids were crying, there was yelling and no space or direction to where you should go… so when we landed in Vienna… it was the most incredible thing.
It was silent, organized, we could flush toilet paper (!!! we didn’t know Greece has poor plumbing…) we had McDonalds following Maeghan’s goal to eat it in every country we visit, we downloaded our fav podcasts (and Maeghan has a cameo in one!!), and facetimed family from a bus(!!!!) with real wifi and saw our family in full-resolution… no more pixelated heads :D
And that was all just in the first 30 mins of being here, this city got even better after that.
We explored the beautiful buildings, the meaningful history and ate / drank the best things. Vienna is pretty awesome and we will definitely come back.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
Sisi of Bavaria was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary who had this building constructed for her and her husband to live in with plans to build an identical building across the way. She was sadly assassinated (by accident!) in 1898 and her husband stopped construction due to a broken heart.
Later in history, this Imperial Palace was used by Adolf Hitler to perform his famous speech, proclaiming Austria as part of the Third Reich.
And today, all the buildings are in such great shape… looking back, I think the Parthenon in Greece may have looked similar to this one back in the day 😃
Meet Claire 👋 she is an incredible woman we had the pleasure of meeting (by eaves-dropping and totally striking a cool Canadian conversation… 😊). She is an opera singer who is studying her masters in Austria. She shared a few hours with us talking about her work, some challenges and the philosophies she lives by as she trains to as a Opera singer. It was such an inspiring conversation. Claire had such a love/passion for Opera, so much so, that she wanted to share with us and gave us two free tickets to a show!!!
We ended up going our last night in Vienna, and it was pure magic.
So there’s a thing in Vienna, where you can go see the Opera with standing tickets. They only cost 3 euros!

Are there still fireworks in a famously quiet, central residential area in Austria’s capital?
New Year’s Eve in Vienna used to sound like being thrown into a war zone — a staccato of explosions with sound volume close to or above the pain threshold for hours and hours and hours … But those days are gone. Over the last few years, the change of years became relatively silent in Austria’s capital. Officially, the main reason is that Vienna has forbidden all pyrotechnics above class F1 (anything children are legally allowed to use) within city borders. Further, supermarkets no longer sell fireworks, citizens are more concerned about the environmental and climate impact, and dog owners (Austrians cherish their furry family members) have become more vocal.
This is especially true for my residential area — the Nordbahnhofviertel. This rather new part of the city, although very central, is quiet as can be. It is traffic-calmed, has many driving bans, and sometimes you get the impression that there are more cargo bikes than cars. And, predominantly inhabited by young families, it is not a party hotspot by far.
Anyway, even there, fireworks and firecrackers still exist, and people either love or hate them. Depending on the side, the reported noise quantification fluctuates between Animal Crossing and Call of Duty scenarios. Unsatisfying as this is, I have decided to put a little more data into this discussion.
I have used the mobile app Night Hark to measure the sound volume during the night and to detect the sound of fireworks/firecrackers. Therefore, I have placed an iPhone 8 next to the closed window in my apartment on the third floor and let it record the night. I put it into my home office room with closed doors, so there might be some noise contamination from my family and me, but it shouldn’t be too bad. After all, I can code there without being disturbed by my kids playing Ninja in the living room shouting the name of Jutsus.
I will report the sound volume in decibels full scale. Since mobile phones use digital microphones, one only gets the sound pressure level relative to the maximum signal capacity of the microphone (= 0 dbfs). I don’t know how much that is for an iPhone, but my best guess would be to put it somewhere close to 100 dB. The app would also return an A-filtered measure, which is tuned to the hearing spectrum of humans, but since this is at least partly about animals and I have no clue if A-filtered would be appropriate, I stick with dbfs (if you know more about this, please let me know in the comments).
Before we get to the results, a last help for interpreting them: Loudness is not linear. An increase of 10 dB corresponds to a perceived doubling of loudness. So 60 dB is double as loud as 50 dB.
We can see in Fig. 1, which displays the max sound pressure level per minute, that there is a build-up till midnight when loudness jumps to its max value and stays there for around half an hour before ebbing down. During the build-up there seem to be two local maxima at around 19:00 and 21:00 — maybe those were fireworks for very small and small children who cannot stay awake till midnight. After 2 o’clock, it is practically quiet.
Further, the scale was never maxed out with 0 dbfs, so the phone could have been able to quantify even louder sounds. The loudest minute was 0:32 with -17.8 dbfs. If my guess of a max value of 100 dB is correct, this would correspond to 82.3 dB, or for reference, a motorcycle or a crying baby. Not quiet, but only an eighth of the loudness of a disco at 110 dB or a 32nd of the pain threshold at 130 dB.
Honing in on fireworks and firecrackers, I looked at the count of either fireworks or explosion classifications with a score greater or equal to .05. (Night Hark uses YAMNet, a neural network, that can classify sound snippets of 0.975 seconds into 500+ categories. Each sound category gets a score between 0 and 1, with greater values indicating a higher likelihood that the snippet belongs to the specific category). Since the sound behind the window is somewhat muffled and the time resolution is limited, this is no 1:1 representation of the actual number of bangs, but the proportions between time-frames should be valid.
In Fig. 2, we can again see a clear peak at midnight, a local maximum at 20:30, and a hard stop at 02:00.
Whether this is a lot or quasi-nothing lies in the ear of the listener, but I am sure this is comparatively silent for New Year’s Eve in a metropolis. I am interested in your experiences and thoughts on that, so please let me know in the comments.
If you want to look at the data, you can find it here.
Night Hark, the app I have used for the sound measurements, is available on iOS and Android.

It is the curse of my life that I can move faster than the seasons, hop between continents overnight and change countries like fashion but I can never escape seasonal allergies. I thought coming to Vienna from Croatia would be a good change of climate and that change of seasons would get rid of my allergies. Alas, the springtime pains continue.
I spent two nights in Vienna with enough time on the first day to walk around the city and take pictures of all the baroque and neoclassical architecture. I started off at the Wein Rathaus (city hall) and then wandered through a rose garden to the Ephesos Museum and later arrived at St. Stephen’s Cathedral. What I noticed the most along the streets were the decorations at the top and corners of the buildings.
Many of the older buildings have statues sculpted and moulded to tell a story that I do not know. I wondered if these semiotics remained relevant today and if knowing them would make the buildings any more significant or if they’re just meaningless decoration. Somehow I doubt it.
In Invisible Cities by Itali Calvino Marco Polo says, “You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.” To which Khan replies, “or the questions it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.”
Stephen’s Cathedral is the jewel of the city and it was kinda cool but also less impressive than I expected. Mass was in session so I couldn’t walk the nave but it wasn’t as tall nor as ground as other cathedrals I’ve visited.
On the south side is a tower 343 steps up to the bell tower. The entrance is sort of hidden in the corner. I thought there’d be more to it but it was literally a single spiral staircase going up and up and up. The only break was for the bell room, sans bell, and at the top it was a chamber to buy souvenirs with small windows on the four sides. I thought the cityscape would be more interesting but there wasn’t much to see. The roof had an interesting tiled pattern on it but even that was difficult to see from this vantage.
Since it was going to rain the next day I decided to check out some nearby parks to see if they were interesting. I walked along the canals and came to Augarten park which had a distinctly familiar tower. It was only after reading the plaque that I remembered seeing it in a YouTube video. These are two of six World War 2 anti-aircraft towers built to protect the city. One is a command/communication tower and the other is for the guns.
After my thesis I’ve taken an interest in the architecture of memorials and dilapidated structures. The architecture of this war has been preserved as a reminder to the horrors of forced labour under the social nationalist regime — but it got me thinking about how we preserve old and culturally important of structures. The towers are clearly decaying and concrete is spalling off. Around the base is a fence. They no longer guard the city but being surrounded by parkland are evident along the city skyline.
At first I wondered why the structure isn’t open to the public to climb and explore. Since it’s from a recent war and not a long ago castle or fortress this probably isn’t appropriate. It’s also apparently dangerous according to the youtube video because of a failed attempt to destroy it.
But to leave it to decay seems like a lost opportunity. Why isn’t there art? Murals or ribbons or lights that in the immediate term express peace juxtaposed to war. I’d first seen the towers from the top of St. Stephen’s cathedral. I’d thought them a fortress worth checking out. I suppose I was partly correct, but if they had been colourful and less stoic, maybe there would be a better relationship to the city. In the long term, seeing vegetation slowly consume the structure might be a suitable future. This would be better then the current state of decay as pigeon on roosts but I suspect realistically they will fall into disrepair to a state where the government has to demolish them.
I found this online, https://www.worldbook.com/behind-the-headlines/Mythic-Monday-The-Riddle-of-the-Sphinx:
The Sphinx is found in both ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology. In the story of Oedipus, the goddess Hera sent the Sphinx to plague the people of the ancient city of Thebes. This was punishment for an ancient crime, possibly the failure to atone for the crimes of a former king of Thebes. The Sphinx sat perched on a mountain cliff nearby the ancient city. The creature guarded Thebes with a riddle that she had learned from the Muses. Each time a traveler failed to solve her riddle, she devoured them, effectively preventing anyone from leaving or entering the city.
The riddle? “What being has four legs, then two, and then three?” Some accounts write it, “What has four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?”
After many people guessed incorrectly and were killed, the king of Thebes announced that he would give the kingdom to anyone who could solve the riddle. The road past Mount Phicion, where the Sphinx awaited her victims, was strewn with the bones of people who had failed to find the right answer. Eventually, Oedipus, fleeing Corinth, solved the riddle. He answered, “Man, who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two legs, and finally needs a cane in old age.” Upon hearing the correct answer, the Sphinx jumped from the cliff to her death. The plague of Thebes was lifted.
It would seem that Vienna is asking me what wonders I like while simultaneously holding me captive. But where the riddle has a simple answer, the question might be rhetoric. I’m not convinced that the answer is a wonder at all…
The wonders of Vienna seem to palaces and the most prominent is the Schönbrunn Palace. It was an 18th century summer home for the emperor and there are two tours of the inside. These tours have been scripted to move the highest volume of tourists through in the least time. Measured by the number of rooms (22 or 40) the latter takes just 50 minutes. Both are accompanied by audio guides to shuffle along the cattle and since photography isn’t allowed, there’s little reason to linger.
I was once again sniffled by being too old to get the student discount and ended up paying more because I visited the Sisi museum but didn’t get a combined ticket (the student rates would have been cheaper). The Sisi museum was more interesting because the second half was a story about the empress and had a narrative to follow. In both places I was surprised by the lack of luxury on the interior since there are so many other decorated buildings with statues and faces on the facades in the city. This might be because the emperor Franz Joseph was known for leading a simple life devoted to running the country. Another strange aspect of the two residence I saw, at the summer palace and in the city, were that the main rooms didn’t seem to be located central to the buildings. It was as if the emperor and empress lived to the side. There was a model of the palace and where the royal residence were was far removed from the centre.
While the buildings were somewhat of a disappointment, the Schonburnn gardens behind the summer palace was nice and free. I particularly enjoyed the Roman Ruins which were an artificial construct fashionable during the 18th century with the rise of Romanticism that symbolizes the decline of revered civilizations and the desire to preserve relics. Interestingly, romanticism intentionally creates ruins from scratch as a point of interest in the garden but does not actually preserve anything.
At the top of the hill the Gloriette Schloss Schönbrunn is an observation pavilion that looked cool but I didn’t purchase a ticket to go to the rooftop. Instead I walked around the base and then made my way back down the hill. Though it is a symmetrical garden, I was kind of surprised that the most colour was on the wings in the rose gardens. Between the palace and the hilltop was a fountain and just grass fields.
The architecture in Vienna was interesting but I found myself more interested in the typical 5 storey housing typology than the palaces or monuments. Many of these housing buildings were distinctly recognizable as Germanic and I would have liked to study the buildings and statues decorating the top more closely. Unfortunately the Airbnb I stayed was the ground floor of a grimy building of little historical significance. Other than a water fountain in the hallway, now brackish, there was little evidence of how people might have lived before a mid-century renovation. I made a poor selection in this AirBnB to save a few bucks. Neither did it help the war on allergies that the place had grimy floors or that the room smelled musty. After two nights I was very happy to leave.
I realized in my next destination that what draws me the most isn’t the seven or seventy wonders of the city but what might have been there before.

Vienna has a register for its trees. I learned this through my favourite crowd-sourcing app, iNaturalist. It allows identifying surrounding plants and animals by simply making a picture and uploading it through the app. A community of fellow users and iNaturalist algorithms suggest possible identifications.
I was scrolling on my way to give a talk but I still had some time, so I went into a park to observe some Viennese urban wildlife. One of my observations was a tree (probably poplar).
The observation is registered in iNaturalist as observation #22987310. Not long after uploading the images to iNaturalist I got the feedback that I should have listed the observation as a cultivated tree. “My” tree was apparently planted and it is 45 years old and has the tree registry number 30.
It is these kinds of interactions and data linkages, that makes me love iNaturalist and its community.

Discovering the History and Culture of Austria
Vienna, the imperial capital of Austria, is a city of striking contrasts. With its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant cultural scene, it’s no wonder that it has become a top destination for travelers from around the world. In this article, we will take you on a journey through the wonder of Vienna, exploring its history, culture, and beauty.
Vienna’s history stretches back over 2,000 years, and the city is steeped in rich culture and tradition. From the Habsburg dynasty to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Vienna has played an important role in shaping European history. Visitors can explore this history by visiting landmarks such as Schönbrunn Palace, the former summer residence of the Habsburgs, or the Hofburg Palace, the winter residence of the Austrian emperors.
The architecture of Vienna is equally impressive, with stunning examples of Baroque, Gothic, and Art Nouveau styles. The city’s main cathedral, St. Stephen’s, is a beautiful example of Gothic architecture, while the Belvedere Palace is a masterpiece of Baroque design. The Jugendstil style, known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe, is also prominent in Vienna, with many buildings featuring decorative facades and intricate ironwork.
Vienna is also renowned for its music and cultural scene. The city was home to famous composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Strauss, and visitors can explore their legacies by visiting places such as the Vienna State Opera or attending a classical concert at the Musikverein. Vienna is also home to a vibrant contemporary arts scene, with galleries and museums showcasing both established and up-and-coming artists.
Foodies will find plenty to love in Vienna as well, with its rich culinary traditions and world-renowned coffee culture. From the famous Sachertorte chocolate cake to hearty traditional dishes such as Wiener Schnitzel, Vienna is a city that is sure to please the palate. And of course, no visit to Vienna would be complete without a visit to one of its many traditional coffeehouses, where visitors can relax and soak up the city’s atmosphere.
Beyond the city itself, Vienna is surrounded by stunning natural beauty, with the Austrian Alps just a short distance away. Visitors can take day trips to picturesque towns such as Hallstatt or explore the nearby vineyards and sample some of Austria’s world-famous wines.
When planning a trip to Vienna, there are a few must-see sights and experiences that should be at the top of any traveler’s list. First and foremost, a visit to Schönbrunn Palace is a must. This stunning palace, with its beautifully landscaped gardens, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers visitors a glimpse into the lives of the Habsburgs.
Another must-see attraction is St. Stephen’s Cathedral, the city’s main cathedral and one of the most impressive examples of Gothic architecture in Europe. Visitors can climb to the top of the cathedral for a stunning view over the city.
For those interested in the arts, a visit to the Belvedere Palace is highly recommended. This stunning Baroque palace houses one of the world’s most important collections of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
Finally, no visit to Vienna would be complete without a visit to one of the city’s traditional coffeehouses. These atmospheric cafes, such as Café Central or Demel, offer a taste of old-world Vienna and are a great place to relax and people-watch.
Vienna is considered one of Europe’s most beautiful and culturally rich cities for good reason. From its stunning architecture and world-class museums to its vibrant music scene and famous coffeehouses, there is no shortage of things to see and do in this historic city. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply someone who enjoys the finer things in life, Vienna is sure to captivate and inspire you. So why not plan a trip to this magical city and experience its wonder for yourself?

A week ago I was in Vienna, Austria for 48 hours. It was a short but meaningful trip.
The city is renowned for its “café culture.” A very particular collection of biases and instincts that shape the behaviors one can see.
The most iconic example of this particular collection is Café Central, a classical, old world café. Here’s an area near the front windows.
The café is famous, in part, because it was Adolf Hitler’s favorite when he lived in Vienna. Joseph Stalin’s too. In fact, for a time in 1913, Stalin, Hitler, Trotsky and Freud all lived within a kilometer of this meeting place.
Needless to say, the café is not a beacon of modernity.
The coffee was bitter and bland.
The service was (intentionally) bad. Half an hour before black coffee arrived.
The people were uniformly white and mostly old.
They were gossiping and gawking. Looking for and at those that didn’t fit the narrative of early 20th century Vienna.
On Monday, my 3pm flight allowed just enough time for one more Viennese café.
We went in a different direction this time. To a “third wave” coffee shop located near the University of Vienna called Coffee Pirates.
It couldn’t have been further from what we’d seen at Café Central.
The service was brisk and friendly.
The coffee was made slowly, to order, and with care.
The patrons were working, learning, building.
The presentation was thoughtful and generous.
From the moment we opened the door to the moment it closed behind us, were constantly invited to participate in the story that Coffee Pirates was telling about coffee. A story about community, about the way we connect.
Café Central was telling a very different story about coffee. One much more steeped in tradition for tradition’s sake. One about the premium of exclusion and the value of difference.
Café Central was a story about the ways things were.
Coffee Pirates is a story about the ways things will be.
I know where I want to spend my time.

It’s been a while since my last blog! I’ve been taking some time to reflect on my summer, spend time with family and friends and have been swamped with Givesie and participating as a vendor at many local Portland events during the last few months.
But I am back this week and wanted to share with you my amazing trip to Europe this summer! I got the chance to visit Vienna, Austria and Zurich and Lucerne, Switzerland with my parents. It was by far one of the best experiences of my life! And to be able to share those memories with my mom and dad is priceless.
Vienna has this richness in history and architecture; the museums, the palaces, the statues, the cathedrals and gardens are breathtakingly beautiful and so intricate in detail! One of my favorite sights to see was the St. Stephan’s Cathedral, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna and the current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, which was completed in the year 1160. It is the most important religious building in Vienna, “has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city’s most recognizable symbols.” Walking inside I was immediately in awe of the stunning, yet dark and dramatic beauty of the interior. Words could not describe the sense of peace, calm and excitement I felt all at once walking through.
The Schonbrunn Palace is one of the busiest tourist sites to see in Vienna. It is a neoclassical style palace and was built during the reign of empress Maria Theresa and was also the home of Franz Joseph, the longest-reigning emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, along with his wife Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria. I loved touring through this palace, it was decorated exactly how it would have looked when it was first built. I felt like I had gone back in time, envisioning what it would have been like to be alive and living during the 18th/19th centuries.
Another one of my favorite places to visit was the Belvedere Palace. Consisting of two Baroque palaces, the Upper and Lower and set in the Baroque park landscape and the Belvedere garden, it houses the Belvedere museum. Walking through the museum I was surrounded by the most stunning pieces of historical art done by some of the most famous artists from around the world and from centuries ago! Definitely a sight to see!
As we wrapped up our tour of the museum we worked up an appetite — so, mom, dad and I had to stop at the cutest little café on the palace grounds for a late afternoon latte and pastry! So. Good.
After our amazing time in Vienna, we were off to Zurich and Lucerne, both are beautiful cities surrounded by stunning mountain ranges, lakes and charming medieval towns.
The train ride my parents and I took from Vienna to Zurich was probably one of my most favorite parts of the trip! It was an eight hour ride, but felt so much shorter! We had such a great time chatting, taking pictures, eating delicious meals, passing by and stopping through small towns, seeing the gorgeous mountainous scenery and huge lakes and rivers. We spent just a few days in Zurich, seeing Old Town, browsing through local boutique shops, shopping for souvenirs, as well as taking a day trip to Lucerne along with a boat ride on the lake. Even though it was a short time — it was absolutely perfect! I remember sitting outside this adorable French outdoor cafe by the lake and enjoying an afternoon espresso with my parents, while people watching — and thinking to myself — I can’t believe I am actually here and enjoying this beautiful moment with my mom and dad that I will cherish forever.
This trip gave me such perspective and such an appreciation for travel and exploration! Being in a new environment, new people, new culture. There is such a big world out there to see and experience. We tend to get caught up in our normal routines, the everyday tasks, work, etc…and tend to forget that there is so much to appreciate in life! Sometimes you just have to get out of your comfort zone and your norm to be able to see things in a new light. xx

A city that reminds me
Of a town,
Vienna,
The one with cool winds
And cooler heads.
On a Sunday,
Everyone gets a break,
The city shuts down,
As if on a curfew.
No shoppers or eaters
Roaming on the streets,
All establishments shut
And everyone stays home.
For an outsider
Vienna seems forlorn,
Like their city did during the lockdown.
But for insiders,
It is a paradise
As they enjoy time with family
At home.
Even on a Monday,
There is no hurry,
No running behind a bus or a train
No speed walking down the pathways.
Those going to the office or school,
Stroll at their pace,
Enjoying the winds
And the sun,
And their coffee in breaks.
They work at their pace
Enjoying the task at hand,
Undisturbed by the distractions,
As if in a mystic flow.
They cycle, calm and slow,
Not in a hurry to reach their destination
For them, the journey
Seems to be their destination.
Not formal wear,
No big cars or big frills
Just them in their shorts and ts
Going about their day
Like it’s a treat.
Living their lives
In a pause,
They teach me
How to take a break,
And learn how to walk slow,
To enjoy every moment,
Whether on vacation,
Or at work.
They teach me
To lessen my agendas
To leave behind the past
And let the future rest
To be in the present,
In this here and now.
I learn to sit still,
Immerse myself in the now,
Enjoy my surroundings,
And the words I read;
Stopping for a coffee
Every now and then.

Like Atlas, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, wait staff in Vienna take their job very, very seriously.
Vienna: the capital of Austria, home of the Hasburg dynasty, old architecture and tardy, poker faced, sarcastic wait staff.
In one of Europe’s oldest cities, with a long and rich cultural history, and a reputation as one of the world’s centres of art and learning, the wait staff rule supreme. Long waits for service, being ignored and a general attitude of low level irritation that you want to be a customer seems to be the norm.
Ancient architecture = posh attitude
One travel brochure (The Free Map For Young and Clever People) proclaims that in Vienna, “The waiter is king. Don’t be surprised if the waiters are unfriendly - not the guest is king, he is. Treat him as your superior and he will reward you.” The brochure also claims that “waiters NEVER smile” and that for tipping “5-10% of the bill is the amount the king expects from his subjects.”
The advice in The Free Map for Young And Clever People is ridiculously honest and self-deprecating.
To begin with you are annoyed and maybe offended by this behaviour. But, after a few experiences you realise that it’s not actually you personally the waiter hates, it’s everybody – perhaps it’s a persona they all adopt as part of their profession or as a survival tactic against drunk and obnoxious tourists who don’t speak German.
My personal experiences of this phenomenon were being told I had ordered children’s beer when choosing a 330ml sized glass (normal serving size in my country) instead of a ½ litre. My bad. Another was overhearing the same waiter yell at a patron asking them if they wanted to see a menu. Theoretically, this sounds like he was being helpful and doing his job. However, in person, his tone, body language and glare revealed the true nature of his passive aggressive overture. What he actually said nonverbally was “buy something to eat or f**K off”.
When your office is this plush you might be forgiven for developing an arrogant attitude.
A further experience was when buying a Kaserkrainer (vienesse hotdog) from a street vendor in the early hours of the morning. The vendor must have been earning significantly less than the barman and really needed the customers, but felt the need to finish his entire cigarette before deining to serve us. He then spent less time than it took to smoke it heating a sausage on the grill, before wrapping it and throwing it on the counter for me to collect. The patience we were expected to show while waiting was not reciprocal. While we fumbled uncoordinated and inebriated for the correct change, his bloodshot eyes glared with annoyance. How dare we bother him to prepare his advertised victuals and deign to give him a few euros for his disgruntled efforts.
This attitude is strange considering that you want to spend your money at the establishment where said wait staff are employed. You might think they would be welcoming of a tourist who wants to donate them money. You may highlight the link between your custom and their wages – but you would be wrong. The waiter just has no f**ks to give about you and your desires to eat or drink or be treated like a human being.
“Let them eat cake” - Marie Antionette was a Hasburg and probably developed the attitude that cost her life while growing up in Vienna.
Sometimes this apathy worked in our favour. For example, when the bus driver was in danger of having to do something untoward, such as turn in his seat, converse with you and maybe issue you a ticket. Instead, it was easier for him to just lift his eyes, wave his hand dismissively towards the general direction of the back of the bus and grunt something. We interpreted this as there would be no charge, but it may have meant - “I just don’t give a s**t.” I doubt he would have come to our defence if an undercover ticket check had taken place.
Advice for ‘Acting like a local' — “Be Grumpy”
The Free Map for Young and Clever People makes an effort to explain why the Viennesse hate on life. Under the heading ‘Act like a Local’ it was suggested that you “be grumpy”. Supposedly, it is “mandatory” for “original Vienesse to complain if the bus is one minute late or the weather is too hot/cold/wet/sunny. This “mentality” (general bad attitude) was justified as being part of the rich Vienesse culture and is based on hundreds of years of historical precedent and practice.
Back in the day (16-18th Centuries), Vienna was the home of the Hasburg Dynasty and the centre of several empires. As such it was a center of commerce, education, construction etc, and developed a large bureaucracy which served the monarchy and employed half the population of the city. Everybody knows that a high standard of living, steady employment and job security suck, so it is understandable that these unlucky civil servants developed a negative attitude.
Members of the Hasburg dynasty pretty much ruled most of Europe in the 16th - 18th centuries
According to the Free Map for Young and Clever People this explains why wait staff, and more generally everyone (especially if they had an ancestor who worked for the government) has the historical right to be grumpy, rude or generally a dick.
Other historical facts from the Free Map include how after WWII “all the Nazis miraculously disappear and the population suffers a collective loss of memory as far as the last 7 years are concerned.”
This appeal to history is obviously a bullsh**t excuse to act like a jerk. More likely, people being people, they could not leave their work at work and the hierarchal structure of a feudal bureaucracy permeated into their attitudes and behaviour outside of their jobs. Add a mix of simian tribalism or pack behaviour and next thing everyone is looking down their noses at anyone else their social standing allows them to – and treating them accordingly.
What is mystifying is that in contemporary Vienna, a city where the Arts and Humanities are cultivated, this is a standard of behaviour that some aspire to. Or perhaps it’s as simple as:
“If you don’t like a person, it’s because they remind you of something you don’t like about yourself.” — Sigmund Freud, father of modern psychology and resident of Vienna, before being forced to fleeing prior to WWII.

Football has always been more than a pastime for me. I grew up just outside of Pittsburgh in the 1970s — a golden era for football, especially for Steelers’ fans. Between 1974 and 1979, the Steelers won four Super Bowls — what a time to be part of the Steeler Nation! And for a child coming of age in Western Pennsylvania, football wasn’t just a sport — it was part of my DNA.
As I grew into adulthood and my job took me all over the world, I never gave up on the Pittsburgh Steelers — to this day, I remain a devoted fan with season tickets. Of course, today, I live in Vienna, Austria, and don’t often make it to Pittsburgh, but my children go to games, and I join them whenever I can. Fortunately, I found another way to get my daily football fix: the Vienna Vikings.
When I was presented with the opportunity to become co-owner (and lawyer) of the Vienna Vikings, one of Europe’s most outstanding American football teams, I didn’t think twice. While soccer is unquestionably the most popular sport in Europe, the idea of promoting American football in Vienna appealed to me on several levels.
On a personal level, I’m a huge football fan, no matter what continent it’s being played on. And to have the opportunity to move from fan, aka spectator, to actually being involved in the day-to-day decisions and management of a team — it’s something of a dream come true. Over the years, I even built close friendships with players like the late Franco Harris, a Pittsburgh legend, and we worked on a few business projects together.
On a professional level, the investment potential is enormous, not unlike a burgeoning startup. While the Vienna Vikings are an established team with a long and proud tradition in Austria, they hadn’t yet made an impact at the international level when I joined. The Vikings had been a national amateur powerhouse and only recently joined the international European League of Football (ELF), a professional European league. I felt this was a prime moment to join the team and help it expand from the somewhat limiting national level into an international high-flier.
Of course, as with any startup, there are challenges and questions along the way. How will the Vikings compete on an international level? How will we get the best players? Will fans remain loyal to the team in the new league?All of these questions, I understood, could be addressed with strategy, forward planning, and strong leadership. And as a lawyer and a lifelong football fan, I felt I had something to contribute.
Austria has an impressive football development system, with nearly 1,000 players at the high school level working their way up from amateur leagues to the professional level. This offers a vast pool of local talent when it comes time for the draft.
ELF rules stipulate that teams can only draft four American players — this rule keeps the playing field fair (pun intended) and prevents an unsustainable “arms race” for foreign stars, which is what doomed previous European football leagues.
Unlike some teams in ELF who rely heavily on their American players, who often bring to the table NFL-caliber talent, the Vienna Vikings rely on a mix of local, European, and American talent.
That combination matters. Last season, for example, we were playing in Poland — behind all game, without our starting quarterback. Even our backup got injured mid-game. That’s when our third-string QB, a 40-year-old who hadn’t played professionally in years, stepped up. Against all odds, he led the final drive and won the game in the last 30 seconds. That’s the kind of resilience and depth we’re building.
American football in Europe is still catching up to the NFL — there’s no denying that. But that’s also what makes this journey exciting. There’s an authenticity here, a real desire to achieve the highest possible level of professionalism.
Unlike soccer, which often skews male and rowdy in its European fan base, American football here is a family affair. You’ll see parents and kids enjoying the game together — a dynamic that’s helped the sport grow across different audiences. The fact that English is the sport’s official language also broadens the audience to include diverse people from different backgrounds.
I’m optimistic about the future of American football in Europe, both as a fan and as an investor. Last year, millions of people showed up and tuned in to watch the European championship game, the Eurobowl. The Vienna Vikings reached the final, though we came up just short. But the growing international audience is undeniable.
The Vienna Vikings, in particular, have a wide and expanding fan base that extends beyond Austria. Vienna’s historical role as a cultural capital draws in fans from Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and beyond — making the Vikings more than just Austria’s team.
We’re in discussions with several NFL teams about building strategic partnerships. The idea of an eventual NFL Europe division featuring cities like London, Frankfurt, and hopefully Vienna is no longer a pipe dream. It makes strategic sense for the league, and we believe Vienna is in a “sweet spot” to be a part of that future.
Personally, I believe football remains a source of joy. I love the sport, enjoy it with my children whenever possible, and am fully invested in the Vikings’ growth and expansion.
Yes, there’s still work to do. The NFL has set certain standards, and Europe needs to catch up. But the trajectory is clear. The enthusiasm is real. And the foundation we are building is solid.
And I’m proud to be part of it.

Words by Boris Fishman and Alex HalberstadtPhotographs by Francesca Catastini
THE SLATE-COLORED JANUARY MORNING drummed cold rain against the windows of Café Prückel. My friend Boris and I had arrived on the red-eye from JFK two hours before. He wanted to sleep; I wanted to go to Prückel, and he’d reluctantly agreed.
Vienna is renowned for its cafés. There’s the toothache-inducing gilt of Café Central, the faux-bohemian shabbiness of Café Hawelka, the raspberry-bordello color scheme of Café Sacher. But my first destination in Vienna is always Café Prückel. Like the more central cafés, it, too, is overseen by taciturn middle-aged men in poly-blend tuxedos. (Viennese servers do not subsist on tips, a fact reflected in their unhurried gait and refreshing disinclination to smile.) But it’s more spacious and sparsely populated, always making me feel pleasurably left alone. Multilingual newspapers hang along the walls, and soft-boiled eggs arrive in eggcups alongside good espresso, and the light streaming in through tall windows invites you to dig your shoulders into the upholstery and linger.
Across the table, Boris didn’t seem to share my enthusiasm. But it wasn’t because I’d kept him from a soft mattress. “It’s like a Soviet cafeteria,” he said, poking unhappily at the cold cuts that had arrived along with the eggs. He surveyed the vast dining area, which, admittedly, did have a wood-paneled wall or two. “The bourgeois version.” I suspected that this was partly why I loved it.
I first came to Vienna when I was 9, a refugee fleeing the Soviet Union. My mother, her parents, and I shared a rundown hotel suite somewhere on the city’s edge. It was the first stop on the journey that would eventually take us to New York, and Vienna was our first encounter with what everyone in the Soviet Union referred to, usually in a whisper, as the West.
Beginning in the late ’60s, hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking refugees passed through Vienna on their way west, mainly to Israel and the United States. Concerned about the appearance of losing so many citizens, Soviet officials preferred to release their refugees to an intermediary nation — and its neutrality made Austria a logical choice. I suppose what I remember most about those weeks in 1979 is a peculiar mixture of emotions: sheer confusion; exhilarated discovery; the distinct embarrassment of being a stranger in what felt like a more civilized civilization; and the recent loss of everything and everyone familiar save a handful of loved ones, a presentiment cushioned for me by the fact of my childhood.
But my most indelible memories of Vienna were of café interiors, especially the vitrines filled with pristine geometric pastries that looked to us like they were made by Fabergé — they were all the more compelling because, subsisting on an allowance from a refugee-resettlement agency, we couldn’t afford to taste them. Now, decades later, I could — and did, an architectural piece of strudel surrounded by a moat of vanilla sauce. I was finishing a book about three generations of my family and wanted to find some vestige of our passage, and of my former self. On this, my fifth visit to Vienna in ten years, I wanted to know one more thing: Why did the city pull me to itself so relentlessly?
JANUARY IN VIENNA: I should have known better. But if Alex had proposed the Sahel in August, I probably would have said yes, too. In Alex, I’d finally met, after 29 relatively barren American years, what felt like a doppelgänger. He had experienced the same immigration I had, ten years earlier; it had left him with similar complexes; and he had the same degree of separation from his Russianness and Jewishness that I did.
And I was curious about Vienna. It was where my family and I encountered the West in 1988, when I was 9. No one had told me where we were going or why, but the signs weren’t good. In the months before leaving, as we pawned everything in our apartment and whittled a century in Minsk into one suitcase per person, my sweet, sheltered Soviet life gave way to unspecified terror. (Ordinary people didn’t travel outside the Soviet Union, and those who did certainly never got to return.) On the rail platform of the train to Vienna — it was easier to imagine visiting Mars — my mother wept as if someone had died. Soviet customs had just upended our suitcases and treated itself to my mother’s wedding ring and a set of gold cutlery. My neck burned with a gold necklace concealed under the top button.
Thirty-six hours later, we rolled into a kind of fairy tale. Even poor people seemed to drive Mercedeses. The supermarkets had automatic sliding doors, which my father learned after nearly toppling an emerging Austrian grandma. I gorged on bratwurst oozing with bergkäse cheese and ice cream cylinders wrapped at the ends with striped twine. In this country, the sausages melted like ice cream, and the ice cream came wrapped at the ends like cured sausage! Once, I came across a kitchenware store so beautiful that, my mouth agape, I walked right into the window, my forehead leaving a spot on the glass. We might as well have been rural North Koreans trying to defect to Ibiza. (At our medical checkups, the doctor handed us a diagram that explained that my mother had to consume the pills for her earache orally, not by putting them in her ear, as previous immigrants had been doing in deference to the Soviet habit of treating earaches with ear compresses.) But Vienna — Vienna would do.
Since immigrating, as I Americanized, then de-Americanized to reconnect with my heritage, then pureed both parts of myself into a thoroughly imperfect but more or less livable hash, I thought of Vienna now and then, the way you wonder about what might have been with someone had the timing been better. In places like Austria, I imagined, they didn’t worship “freedom” to the point of anarchy; were less ready to sacrifice morality for profit; did not regard intellectuals with suspicion; and took care of artists — took care of people in general. Alex felt a deeper attachment to our adopted homeland. It was the one part of him that mystified me.
Thirty years earlier, a small number of refugees like us had found a way to remain in Vienna. “What are you all stampeding over there for?” one, named Sasha, kept asking us. He meant America, a word that to us meant more than Shangri-la. Sasha had visited Brooklyn, where we were heading. “What’s it like?” my mother asked. “It’s not like anything,” he said. When we finally encountered it two months later — low-slung, dirty, and gray — we remembered his words. What if I’d spent the last three decades in Vienna, instead? But there’s the fantasy and the cold, gray, wood-paneled truth.
MY FIRST MEMORY OF VIENNA begins aboard an Aeroflot jet, its fuselage painted with a winged hammer and sickle. My mother and I left Moscow in our winter coats, carrying two suitcases containing six changes of clothes, a photo album, and a book of poems by Anna Akhmatova. My mother’s wedding ring and watch were taken in customs. Aboard the plane we were served an unexpectedly luxurious meal of baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and a wedge of soft processed cheese in a foil wrapper that read “Progress!” I remember my mother slipping the metal forks and knives into her coat pockets. An hour into the flight the pilot announced, in German and then in Russian, that the plane had left Soviet airspace. “Meine Damen und Herren…,” the announcement began, and when it was finished one or two passengers, the boldest ones, clapped. At the airport in Vienna, I sat on my suitcase and gaped at a security guard with a German shepherd and a submachine gun. Then I watched a pilot walk out of the gate, his hat embroidered with the six-pointed star of Israel. “Is Austria a capitalist country?” I asked my mother. She said I looked “as scared as a rabbit.”
To revisit a place remembered from childhood is to realize two rather disappointing facts: (1) Most of us recall childhood through a filter of adult sentimentality, and (2) our memories are, at best, undependable — researchers have found that every time we mentally access a memory, our recall of it changes. We confabulate others unwittingly, with a clear conscience. And the more I thought about my weeks in Vienna in the fall of 1979, the more I had to admit that two things had occupied nearly all of my 9-year-old brain: non-Soviet makes of automobiles and eating. Luckily, my interest in cars has waned, but eating remains a preoccupation. The Viennese are preoccupied with it, too, though without the Parisian self-regard or Roman chauvinism.
As in other cities with thriving café cultures, Vienna’s cafés and bars are cognizant of themselves primarily as social spaces. Most are laid out with watching — and being watched — in mind. Some are as flamboyant as stage sets, but all seem attuned to the public pleasures of tribal togetherness or the kind of low-effort nonconformism that sometimes involves an omelet.
Zum Schwarzen Kameel, where Beethoven had emptied a great many cases of red wine, was celebrating its 400th anniversary, and after a long nap to kill jet lag, Boris and I pulled up two hard barstools in its front room. Popular with maximally groomed, rather cruel-looking regulars — it’s a hangout for conservative politicians — it encourages competitive levels of smoking, which remains permitted in restaurants, another vestige of my Soviet past. Kameel is home to one of the country’s most thorough wine cellars and possibly the most rewarding people-watching in town. Boris and I spent a night there drinking cold Grüner Veltliner, happily lost in talk, while men in quilted jackets and creased trousers crowded around the bar, jockeying for another glass of wine. The only solitary figure was an enervated young woman wearing a fox-fur waistcoat and a Chanel bag sitting across from us. She looked like someone had stood her up. She kept her vividly mascaraed eyes fixed in the middle distance and, with jeweled fingers wrapped around her glass, exhaled drafts of smoke in our faces.
I HAD GIVEN ALEX PRÜCKEL, so he agreed to give me “Swimming Pool.” In Mitteleuropa, when it comes to fitness, yoga and spin classes are still the interlopers, and bath complexes the standard. But we didn’t go to the century-old Jörgerbad pool, in the sleepy 17th district, to take the healing waters. I wanted to see whether the comparative generosity of the Austrian state meant better art. For there was going to be art at the pool, commissioned by the nonprofit arts group Brut, a mainstay of the avant-garde scene in Vienna. A performance artist and several confederates were going to use the pool to “expos[e] the audience to the conflicting feelings of safety and uncanniness.” Whatever that meant.
After some horsing around in the pool, the actors went off to perform various oddities. One poured what looked like red food dye into the pool gutter, making me think of chemical attacks and the extreme generosity of Austrian arts funding. (Alex deemed it “quixotic and bad.”) At home, thanks to our new president, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts — the equivalent of two and a half F-15s — was under the knife.
I had become a full-time freelance writer at 24, and it’s possible that I didn’t sleep or eat for the next year or two — I was too terrified for my future. After a year of 16-hour days and seven-day weeks, I had $22,000, a twitching left eyelid, and not one article I could point to as the product of passion instead of expedience. As bizarre as it was, “Swimming Pool” — or the reality that had made it possible — felt quite okay as an alternative. Everyone in attendance was young, attractive, and responsible — the invitation had said to bring one’s own flip-flops, and everyone had. And serious: They gazed upon the circus before us with the utmost solemnity.
After the performance, we ended up at Rebhuhn, a traditional tavern just outside the city center. It served a Platonic version of grandmother food — pike-perch in a white-wine-but-mostly-butter sauce, chestnut “pasta” over cream and lingonberry preserves — but the best thing about Rebhuhn wasn’t the food. At one table, a woman was reading a newspaper. At another, three lavishly dressed women were having what you just knew was their every-Sunday-night klatch. There were 20-somethings and 80-somethings. No one was “doing a concept” to “maximize covers,” no one was trying to pretend to touch my soul so they could scour my wallet.
When I ate out at such a place in New York, I felt guilty for lingering because I was infringing on the server’s opportunity to turn the table, something I felt responsible for because American restaurants didn’t pay their servers a living wage. Nowhere did this economic model feel as insane as at Rebhuhn in Vienna on a Sunday evening. “Vienna,” Alex said in another theft-worthy line as he mopped sauce with a cube of fish, “is cultural Xanax.” In America, I realized, we were undergoing a kind of national seizure, the kind where you’d stopped noticing that your shoulders were up all the time because you’d internalized terrible economic insecurity as the norm. Safety — an uncanny feeling, indeed. Perhaps the Europe I’d been imagining — the Vienna Alex had been telling me about almost since we’d met — wasn’t only a fantasy.
ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE CITY that saturated my childhood imagination: the streets themselves. After growing up in one of the Brezhnev-era apartment towers that surrounded Moscow like a cinder-block forest, Vienna struck me as a marvel from a distant antiquity. In fact, the city was transformed in the 19th century by Emperor Franz Joseph I, and it is his Vienna — neo-Baroque, orderly, martial — that visitors see today. Franz Joseph’s vision lent the city the quality that has stayed with me most as an adult, a quality that no amount of skyscrapers can efface — an officious, comforting solemnity.
It was just off one of these imperial streets that Boris and I spent our most educational outing in Vienna — at Gasthaus Grünauer, a partly hidden local institution with an interior so low-ceilinged and rustic that it could’ve been located in Middle-earth. We were meeting my friends. Jutta Ambrositsch is the city’s most talented winemaker; her husband, Marco, operates the business side of the winery. The restaurant’s third-generation proprietor, Christian Grünauer, owner of one of the most sardonic faces I’d seen, reminisced in unaccented English about 1980s New York, where he waited tables at an Upper East Side Italian restaurant called Elio’s. One of the regulars there was Donald Trump. “He was so afraid of germs that he wouldn’t shake anyone’s hand,” Christian recalled, “but look at him now, slapping backs and kissing babies!”
Christian’s wife, Katja, prepared Mitteleuropean soul food — grilled veal kidneys, delicately breaded loin of pork, pan-fried whole trout — so flavorful it nearly made us forget about the virtual absence of vegetables. The scene got an infusion of chaos and originality with an appearance of a 60-something gent named Xandi: pear-shaped, red-nosed, leering, perversely avuncular. According to Marco, he was famous around town for his copious eating and drinking, and was rumored to be the father or guardian of 13 children. He waded around our table kissing everyone ceremoniously and wetly and doffing an imaginary hat, then sat down among us, uninvited. He proceeded to deliver a theatrical speech to Jutta that I failed to understand fully due to my meager German, but judging by the suddenly tense faces around the table, its content must have been cutting if not downright mean.
Xandi was demonstrating Wiener Schmäh, a local strain of humor distinguished by dark absurdity, glee at your friends’ misfortune, and masking insult with flattery. When I asked Marco about it later, he shrugged and said, “In Vienna, no joke is too insulting.” I knew what he meant. Back in Brooklyn, Xandi’s behavior would have caused my American-born friends to lapse into embarrassed silence. But at my Russian-Jewish family’s dinner table, an imaginative verbal jab is met with laughter and a grudging appreciation of the offender’s wit — and so it was at Grünauer. No wonder I felt at home.
FROM OUR SIX-HOUR MARATHON of eating, drinking, and smoking, the next morning I remembered only one thing, breathed into my ear by an older gentleman of uncertain employment but many opinions. (This was Xandi, Alex told me later.) “You know why Vienna is perfect?” he said. “It’s 10 to 20 years more slow than everywhere else.” He slapped his doughy hands together, dropping a good bit of cigarette ash onto my jeans. “No complications.”
(I may have remembered only this because, irresponsibly, I didn’t take out my reporter’s notebook all night. Alex and I were very different kinds of travel writers, it turned out — I wrote down everything, and he often waited to see what stuck in his mind. I had decided to try it his way.)
How had we gotten to a world where this was true? Where the best places in Europe were economic B-listers (Portugal, Spain) and those behind the curve (Austria)? This had its downsides. Austria had some of the most progressive social-welfare policies in the world, but you could still smoke in bars and restaurants, and it would be wrong to say Viennese dining had completely left the Wiener schnitzel behind. (Changes were coming to the safety net, too — several weeks before we arrived, a center-right/radical-right coalition had taken power promising to slash social benefits.)
Also, the state extended cultural funding more readily to established artistic institutions than independent artists, which meant that the dynamism and dislocation created by upstart projects often found an easier home elsewhere. Vienna felt less international than almost any Western European capital I’d visited, and almost no one in it seemed to resemble — in dress, habit, conversational references — the globalized elite. This cultural concentrate created a heady unpredictability — the cost, perhaps, of visiting a place like itself and no other. Prückel, “Swimming Pool,” Rebhuhn, Xandi: Even when mediocre, these experiences felt gloriously unrepeatable elsewhere.
GOING OVER THAT NIGHT THE FOLLOWING MORNING, a last scene came into focus: We were at Café Anzengruber, a spot popular with writers and insomniacs, operated by members of a large Croatian clan. Xandi and a pair of young chefs soon appeared. The owner, Tomi, seemed occupied mostly with taunting his defeated-looking brother-in-law, who kept to himself behind the bar. Tomi brought bottles of Croatian Graševina and schnapps and God knows what else and sat down at the table, toasting extravagantly, and soon we were staggeringly drunk. All of us, that is, except Jutta — she sat grinning shyly and a little remorsefully among seven unlaced, hammered men. Something about her expression brought me back to a scene in my childhood kitchen, where my father and four of his friends shared loud, vodka-lubricated enthusiasms about Levi’s jeans and Edgar Winter records, with my mother functioning as the scene’s unmoving, silent axis.
Later, when I related this memory to Julya Rabinowich, one of the country’s best-known authors, she let out an exasperated guffaw. “When it comes to gender equality, Austria is 50 years behind Germany or France,” she said. Despite being a liberal stronghold, Vienna didn’t provide enough day care to meet public demand, Rabinowich explained, forcing many young mothers to stay at home. As in the country of my birth, all too many men here still expected women to handle the majority of the cooking and child care. I was realizing that, culturally, Vienna shared nearly as much with Warsaw-Pact Eastern Europe as it did with the Western democracies. I found much of that kinship problematic, but I couldn’t deny that for me it made Vienna feel as familiar and comfortable as an old blazer. At last, I was deciphering what drew me to this city: It offered much of the essence and manners of my homeland, amid the relative safety and freedom of my home.
In Rabinowich I found something like a double, whose life diverged from mine in ways that interested me. We were born several months apart; her family immigrated from the Soviet Union two years before mine did, but chose to settle in Vienna. I told Rabinowich that, after arriving as a child in New York, I’d felt almost instantly American. “When I was going to school here, no one allowed me to forget I was a foreigner,” she replied. “On the other hand, the government paid for my education, awarded me a stipend that allowed me to write full time, and honored my books with prizes.” We were drinking coffee in a quiet, pretty café in the city’s third district, where everyone seemed to know her by name. Rabinowich, who writes a newspaper column about politics, lamented that the recent election represented “a sharp turn to the right.” She sighed. “But of course I consider myself an Austrian,” she said. “If I leave, I’ll be in exile.”
FOR ALL THE SINCERITY OF MY SEARCHING, there was very little of 1988 Vienna left to discover. Forced to remain neutral as a condition of Soviet withdrawal after the war, Austria didn’t fully accede to the European Union until the mid-1990s. “When I went to Germany in the ’80s, I carried such lists of things to buy that my German friends would jokingly ask me if I wasn’t coming from East Germany rather than Austria,” as one person told me. But once Austria joined the EU, it didn’t look back. The modest pension where my family had stayed seemed to no longer exist, and the street where it was supposedly located listed no store of kitchen supplies.
So it felt like a miracle when it turned out that the two refugee-aid agencies that had shepherded us to America, the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), had representatives in Vienna that had been around for the great Soviet-refugee influx 30 years earlier. (Both agencies continue to serve refugee populations.) Alex and I met them for coffee at Café Frauenhuber, a tourist-district café that miraculously few tourists seem to know about. (Mozart had given his last public performance upstairs, in 1791. Vienna is like that.) And all of a sudden, I was sitting in front of two men whom I very well may have had already met, half a lifetime before.
“I had no time to go to the washroom,” Walter Juraschek, who was with HIAS, said. The child of World War II Polish refugees, he had been made for the work, and began his days at 3 a.m., coaching atheist Soviet people like my parents and grandparents on how to say the right things about Jewish identity to the American consular officers. (Religious persecution was a precondition for refugee status.) HIAS shared an office with the JDC, and Juraschek remembers the waiting rooms and corridors so packed that muscling his way back and forth to his desk proved a daily challenge. He ran interference with the authorities, such as the police officer who had his arm broken by an iron-swinging woman who thought he was coming to arrest her. When the Danish Embassy turned away a Soviet refugee who hoped to emigrate there, Juraschek bombarded the queen of Denmark with letters until she personally intervened.
Inspired by the meeting, I strayed toward the spot on the map that showed the location of the Stadttempel, the main synagogue in Vienna, located in a warren of streets known as the Bermuda Triangle. During my family’s stay in 1988, we’d been taken by the JDC to get a glimpse of the exterior, as holiday services were in progress inside. My grandfather had not come all that way to look at a facade, so he grabbed my hand, split off from the group, and, me at his waist (I still remember the naphthalene smell of his slacks), prised open the heavy wood door. Inside, we saw something we’d never seen in our atheist homeland: Orthodox Jewish men praying. “Fanatics!” he said, not without affection, and winked at me.
True to the promise of the Bermuda Triangle, there was nothing but the backside of an ornate building where the map said the synagogue would be. It didn’t seem like I was meant to find even this — something that definitely still existed. But then, wandering up a side street, I saw it. Or rather the police van that, sadly, so often signals a Jewish place of worship in Europe these days. Who knew if those were the same wood doors my grandfather and I had touched, but their location was the same. As I stood alone in that alley, not wanting to approach them for fear of my intentions being mistaken — I look Middle Eastern — what I was seeing would have to be good enough. And what I was feeling — my grandfather had passed away a month before I’d arrived in Vienna.
ON THE MORNING AFTER the euphoric, drunken night at Grünauer, Jutta drove Boris and me to see her vineyards on the city’s northernmost edge. As we were getting into her Audi, a Japanese tour group emerged from the U-Bahn station nearby, and a woman in a pantsuit leading the tour suddenly shrieked, “Jutta Ambrositsch!” She introduced us excitedly to the group in rapid-fire Japanese. The tourists reacted to this by surrounding us and bursting into applause.
It was an unseasonably cold, foggy day, and Boris and I ended up tramping through muddy vineyards behind Jutta and her elderly fox terrier, Edgar. The view made up for the mud. Standing among the vines on a hill called Nussberg, we looked out over downtown Vienna, anchored by the jutting, silly Millennium Tower, and finally got a sense of the Danube’s massive span. Yet the city was inaudible — we heard only birds. “I live in the city center and I’m a 20-minute drive from the vineyards,” Jutta marveled, pulling a patched hunting jacket tighter around her. “Where else can you do that?”
As a respite from the cold fog and my hurricane-grade hangover, I went to the Kunsthistorisches Museum to see the Bruegels. I spent a long while in the picture gallery on the second floor, looking at ten large panels. Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s village landscapes refuse to be read as religious allegory and exist as documents of rural communities. Their portrayal of the Flemish villagers is neither humorous nor moralizing nor idealistic; instead, they’re suffused with an acceptance of the cycles of daily life — with their 16th-century miseries intact — and a compassion that borders on the post-human.
I stood in front of Hunters in the Snow and remembered the feeling of first seeing it as a 9-year-old. I could picture myself standing beside my mother in that gallery nearly 40 years earlier; the memory was as detailed as though it had happened last week. Later I sat down at a café amid the museum’s imperial-chocolate-cake decor and ordered coffee and a piece of strudel. Then I called my mother in New York. I told her excitedly where I was, and described what I remembered. She listened patiently. “The admission to that museum was expensive,” she said finally. “So we didn’t go. What you remember never happened.”
ON THE BROKEN-HEADED MORNING after our bacchanal, what Vienna calls coffee — an espresso shot lost in a trough of milk and foam — was not going to suffice. I needed rocket fuel, and, feeling morning-after shame of a different kind, headed for the only solution I could imagine: a Starbucks. There, I did something I’ve never done even in America: I ordered a venti. It was only five minutes back to my rental, but it was five minutes longer than necessary to register the horrified stares of rush-hour Vienna at the RPG in my hands.
In the weeks to come, after Alex and I returned to New York, it would be this moment I’d remember more than any other from the trip, crystals of nostalgia forming almost in real time. But no matter how sweet and less mixed my recollections of Vienna became, the feeling never alchemized into a readiness to consider moving there — or anywhere. Having spent so many years looking toward Europe with longing, I’d failed to register just how American I was becoming — if not always ideologically, then due simply to years of being able to order mediocre coffee in three sizes. It isn’t that you can’t go home again. It’s that once you’ve lost it, every place is just what another place isn’t.
That morning, our last, Alex’s friend Jutta was driving us to the 19th district, a posh enclave on the edge of the city that dead-ends in acres of vineyards, including her own. Afterward, at lunch, I told her about my Vienna history. When I mentioned the kitchenware store I’d walked into, she lit up. “It’s called Ostovics!” she said. “There’s one right near Neubaugasse,” the street where I’d told her our pension may have been located. Memory is as vague as it is rigid. It hadn’t occurred to me that the kitchenware store might be on a nearby street.
I had an interview after lunch, but I raced to Ostovics afterward. I remembered floor-to-ceiling windows rather than its glass recessed in a brick enclosure. But the pots and serving dishes behind the glass were painted as beautifully as artworks and actually lived up to the gleam in my memory. I looked around — no one. I’d been feeling regret that I’d not gone up to touch the synagogue doors. (How observantly Jewish, ironically, my investment of that touch with such talismanic power.) So I went up to the Ostovics window and, feeling like a lunatic, brought my forehead to it, like all those years ago. It was cold and dry outside, and the touch left no trace.

Vienna is well known for its high proportion of social housing. Nowadays most sources seem to estimate that around 25% of people living in the city live in some form of municipal housing. It’s evident as you walk around the city. You cannot walk along a street without coming across a housing block with the very recognisable sign outside the entrance. And with the city celebrating it’s 100th year since the first ‘Gemeindebau’ it’s also inescapable in every exhibition about the city’s history.
Housing is an essential component of any city. And with my background working at one of London’s largest housing design practices, I might be biased, but I didn’t think I could come to Vienna to understand how they are approaching gender equitable design without understanding how the city’s housing works.
The existing centre of Vienna is dense, typically made up of courtyard block typologies. So there are limited opportunities for new housing development. The city has a fairly rigid zoning style ‘building code’, which not only sets out built parameters for building lines at the front and back, as well as heights, but also sets out what land uses are allowed on a block by block basis. This has meant that an increasingly popular form of development in the centre is rooftop extensions, as in most areas only a single storey can be added.
In the centre the majority of housing is comprised of flats. It’s not until you get quite far out that you start encountering detached homes. In the older part of town the flats often have unique layouts as they do away with the traditional arrangement of rooms coming off of a hallway, and instead the rooms themselves act as circulation space. This leads to quite space efficient apartments, even if there are some quirks — such as entering the kitchen through the bathroom! Often this comes about through separate apartments having been combined together to create a more spacious home. This also leads to difficulties with living rooms being above bedrooms and vice versa. The other thing that’s worth noting is that many apartments in Vienna in the old town do not have balconies. But as the flats have tall and lofty rooms you don’t miss this so much.
In Red Vienna the city was really reconceptualising how to design for how people wanted to live. The aim was to provide affordable homes of good quality for broad sectors of the population. The housing provided people with light, fresh air and sunshine, as well as nurseries, schools, lending libraries and other communal facilities like laundry rooms. And with more free time they had to organise their lives differently, and the architecture followed suit too — with more space allowed for leisure too. The kitchen became a different kind of space — often with other functions combined with this space, turning it from a purely functional space to one to dwell in. The focus on the evolving role of the kitchen in the home, at the time, ensured that the needs of all genders were taken into consideration and advanced and adapted to new social norms.
Whilst the social principles from which Red Vienna emerged are not necessarily explicitly evident as you walk around the city, many of the ideals still undoubtedly influence and inform the shape of the city and its housing that you see today. And the legacy of the city’s municipal housing undoubtedly has an influence on the shape of its future housing.
Earlier this year I was awarded the RTPI George Pepler Award by the RTPI. The George Pepler Award is a bursary granted to a person in their first 10 years post qualification experience wishing to undertake a short period of study on a particular aspect of spatial planning. I was delighted to win the opportunity to carry out my research proposal entitled ‘What can the UK learn from Vienna with regards to adopting a gender mainstreaming approach to shape built outcomes?’ I am currently in Vienna for researching how Vienna has made itself more Gender Equal. #GenderEqualCities

My first touch with Vienna was in April during my first tour of Europe. The idea was to support the launch of my book about webpack and see some new places. I never intended the trip to lead to a cascade that would change my life, but that’s what ended up happening.
Perhaps the biggest reason for that was the fact that I made new friends and began to see myself in a different light. I have an introverted past, and I fit the stereotype of a nerd well. The first trip began a still ongoing change that’s rewriting me as a person.
I encountered Vienna by chance. I was given an option to give a presentation at React Vienna to conclude the tour. As a curious person, I decided to take the chance. I felt welcomed by the community instantly, and I felt comfortable during the two-hour session.
As I happened to have some free time in Vienna, I explored the city. I’ve learned that one way to get to know the local people is to go to meetups. Even though I am/was an introvert, my curious side tends to win over my natural shyness.
It’s in one of these meetups where I met someone who I consider a true friend now. We connected on an intellectual level and this grew into a deep, personal friendship. The fact that we met is mostly due to chance, but sometimes you have to get lucky to change the direction of your life.
It’s this relationship and the local community that has dragged me to Vienna over and over again. It’s a gift that keeps giving. I keep refining myself and the way I think through the constant interactions I have with the city and its residents.
I believe to get to know a city, you have to spend a long time in it. I decided to try with Vienna as I wanted to see if it’s as good city for me as it felt like the first times I saw it.
You can see that Vienna was a capital of an empire once. It combines high culture with a high-quality of living. It’s a city where you never get bored as there’s always something to do. Most importantly, nature is near.
Not everything is perfect, but it feels like an excellent compromise for me as I could have a lifestyle fitting me here while maintaining valuable personal connections.
The idea behind spending a Summer month in Vienna was simple: recharge batteries, build contacts, develop business, prepare for September presentations at ReactNext and WebExpo. I didn’t intend to change as a person much, but that happened more as a side effect.
This year has made me realize that I have lived a sheltered albeit safe life. But is that a good way to live? I’m in the best condition of my life in many ways. Excellent health and certain skills allowed me to grow myself a decent business and generate a lot of opportunities, but I always felt perhaps something is missing.
It’s easy to live your life in a bubble as you follow a certain routine without questioning. Technically that works, and it worked for me, but what if there is more to life than that? This is the question I began to ask myself more and more, and it feels like Vienna allowed me to find some answers while giving new questions.
You could say I haven’t felt much since the primary school. You shed your last pieces of emotion while you go through the army indoctrination mandatory to Finnish men. The stereotype of a man is not to show emotion in public unless it’s related to sports. Perhaps it’s not so good stereotype after all.
Strangely enough spending time in Vienna began to make me feel more alive than before. As I saw more and more people, I started to get out of my shell. I am still reserved but far less so and I actually enjoy my life instead of settling for what I have. It’s simply amazing I get to do something I like while getting paid well enough to sustain my lifestyle.
I even began to meet people of my opposite sex only to realize that’s the world I know embarrassingly little about. Doing this has given me life lessons that will stick with me for a long while. You can read all the self-help books you want, but sometimes it’s real life that teaches you the most even if it might be painful at times and might force you to feel new emotions.
I still have a long way to go on this road of discovery. I feel as if I was unchained. For me to achieve this, I had to lose my old environment and go far beyond my comfort zone. It’s a path I chose, and I have no idea where it leads, but I am happy to have chosen it.
I find it interesting that starting to do something humble like writing a book to help other people transformed my entire life. First I grew a small business only to realize there’s more to life. And now I’m living the next stage in which I’m discovering what that more is.
During this stage, I will hopefully learn to balance personal side with business as in personal business these two are interrelated. There is no one without another as I’ve come to understand.
I feel as if I gained years worth of life experience by spending a month in Vienna and by being curious enough. I am more aware than ever that I have to grow and develop personally. Perhaps this was the reboot I needed for future success in both business and on a personal level.
For me the conclusion is clear. There’s life beyond computers and business.

The background to my being in Austria in the first place: family. My parents were immigrants to the United States where I was born and grew up. They returned to their home country at some point, which I wasn’t happy about. Long story short: My relationship with this city is ambivalent. I hated it when we first arrived from sunny southern California. It was a completely different world. Over the years, things have changed and a certain cool factor exists plus I love classical music so it’s not the worst place to be spending time.
Here are some cool and weird facts about Vienna along with some of my experiences. Some apply to Austria. Other odd factoids are typically Viennese you won’t find anywhere else.

Vienna, the capital of Austria, stands as a city that seamlessly blends a rich historical legacy, vibrant culture, and a spirit of innovation. It has earned a well-deserved reputation for offering an exceptional quality of life to both its residents and visitors. Notably, Vienna has consistently secured the top spot as the world’s most livable city in esteemed international studies and rankings, such as the Global Livability Index 2022 by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Mercer Quality of Living Survey 2022. But what distinguishes Vienna and enables it to maintain this remarkable achievement for two consecutive years? In this article, we will explore the key factors that contribute to Vienna’s unparalleled livability and unveil the myriad ways in which you can personally immerse yourself in its captivating allure.
Vienna’s public transportation system adds to its allure as an exceptional city to reside in. The city takes pride in its secure and efficient network that not only promotes sustainability and physical well-being but also effectively mitigates traffic congestion. A comprehensive range of buses, trams, trains, and metro lines seamlessly connect every corner of Vienna and its surrounding areas. Moreover, Vienna provides dedicated bike lanes, convenient car-sharing programs, and electric scooters to facilitate eco-friendly mobility options throughout the region.

Vienna has been one of the most popular European metropolises to visit for years. The city, renowned for its excellent wine, classical music, and majestic palaces, continuously captivates travelers from all over the world.
Vienna, with its breathtaking architecture, unique atmosphere, and rich history, attracts millions of tourists annually. It’s no wonder that in 2022, nearly 14 million people visited the city. Furthermore, according to the latest report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the capital of Austria was ranked as the best city to live in the world.
What does the Austrian capital conceal? How can you best experience its ambiance? What is worth seeing? We answer these and many more questions in our editorial guide to Vienna.
Vienna is both the capital and the largest city of Austria. It is located in the northeastern part of the country, close to the borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. Its excellent location allows for quick trips to two other popular European capitals — Budapest and Bratislava, both reachable in less than an hour. Therefore, when planning a trip to Vienna, it’s worth considering a day trip to the capital of Hungary or Slovakia.

Tuesday and Wednesday, May 6 and 7
This may be a long post because it covers two days. We are greeted by the Empress Maria Theresa, one of the rare female monarchs we have encountered. The Viennese speak warmly of her and I believe she had a long and peaceful reign. She also had 16 (!) children, one being Marie Antoinette. They were all intermarried, it seems.
There is another monarch, Empress Elizabeth, whose life was much more complicated, but more about her later.
To be honest, I have taken so many pictures of so many buildings that I can’t remember three days later which is which. I just want to give you a sense of each place. All of the cities started with the Celts, then Vikings, then the Roman Empire. Only rare bits of Roman roads and buildings can be seen.
The streets are narrow and curved in the medieval style. The buildings are from later periods. Many have been rebuilt because of WW II.
In Germany the Renaissance style buildings were over the top, like Baroque and Rococo. But Vienna is a little more subdued. It is spacious and grand and elegant without overwhelm.
So here are a few pictures of various buildings and statues. The only thing I can discern is when I’m taking pictures of a church.
This is not a church. This is the old city gate and its alcove, home to the Sisi Museum and the Lippizaner Museum ( the famous dancing white horses).
Speaking of horses, they have horse drawn carriages you can ride? But we didn’t do this.
What was cool was that the horses all had these decorative head pieces that covered their ears. I guess it gets cold in Vienna in the winter.
This is the Imperial Palace in Vienna, which has a ridiculous number of rooms.
This is some statue monarch made to associate himself with God. I’m not sure if was to honor God or himself, but there was that “divine right of kings” thing going centuries ago. And then you remember all the Prince Bishops… so much intertwining of religious and political power.
I was surprised that a truck drove through a pedestrian area! I didn’t expect that.
Street food.
Now this really surprised me. Here is this beautiful building covered with an advertisement. I looked closed and this is actually a fabric painting reproducing the building; it hides the scaffolding and the ad helps disguise the fabric covering. You don’t even notice it’s fake. A disguise of a disguise.
This is a church. I think it’s St. Stephen’s.
Note the beautiful tiled roof.
It’s always hard to get a picture of the whole church but I got this replica.
Pictures of inside the church follow.
And there is always a gift shop.
After the official tour we decided to go wander around Vienna. Chocolate, anyone? ( I’m talking to you, Abby.) They gave samples, like at an ice cream store.
This made us hungry so we stopped in a coffee shop and of course you need a pastry to go along with your coffee. Even Chappell drank coffee in honor of the tradition.
Interesting sights along the way. Bicycles often have a large front container to carry groceries or to ferry children. If they ferry children they have little car seats with seat belts.
Poor dog!
(Rachel I know. I don’t have many dogs here but not as many people have dogs and they don’t let you pet them.)
Chappell asked me what I wanted to do next. I wanted to go to the Sisi Museum. I’m sure Jeremy knows all about this because he knows about everything. I had never heard of her but she had a tragic life. I am told it is now a Netflix series called “Princess Elizabeth.”
When you go into the museum the first thing you see a is a plaster death mask. She was quite poetic and expressed her melancholy in her journals. They were posted on the walls throughout.
“But mournfully I spread my wide, white wings, return home to the fairy kingdom and nothing shall bring me back again.”
“I am Sunday’s child, a child of the sun. Her golden rays she wove into my throne; with her glow she wove her crown. It is her light that I live, but should she ever wane from me, I must die.”
Sisi grew up in Bavaria out in the countryside. It was an idyllic childhood. She is the little girl in each of these pictures.
This is a bust of her at age 10. She grew into a beautiful young woman who was known for her beautiful hair.
These were some of her Crown Jewels.
And some of her ball gowns.
Her fan
These were her staterooms.
And her personal exercise room.
And her bedroom
Sisi lived a very sad life. She hated the constraints of the court and its duties, but her real torture was her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law was terribly overbearing and ruled with an iron fist.
Even so, the couple was reasonably happy. Sisi was away on a state visit with her husband when their child died at age 6. That caused a rift in their marriage that was never repaired. Sisi began traveling throughout Europe without her husband; she seemed to have given up on her son and left him behind to the “care” of his mother-in-law. (Sisi’s son Rudolph was a disaster, probably as a result of his horrible upbringing.) Sisi, herself, wore black during these sad, later years.
“Elizabeth’s incessant traveling is increasingly characterized by unease and restlessness. The “lady in black” constantly sought to escape the burden of her own personality and was prey to profound melancholy.”
At age 61 she was assassinated by an anarchist who just wanted to create some chaos. She was never meant to be the target, but she was at the wrong place at the wrong time. What a tragic life.
The next day we woke up with a boat gas station and attendant right outside our balcony. I had never thought about the need to fuel up or how they would do that. I’d love to know more about all the behind the scenes workings of the ship.
Chappell had gone to the Schonnbrun Palace (the summer residence), so I had the morning to myself. I had been thinking about going to the Klint Museum but couldn’t get an appointment that didn’t conflict with a planned afternoon tour of the Vienna Boys Choir. So I just spent a sunny morning in the lounge. (This is also where I caught up on my posts.)
This was the view of modern Vienna on the opposite bank from the old city. It’s all very new and modern.
That afternoon I took a trip to the home of the Vienna Boys choir, but it’s more than one choir of boys.
It functions as a boarding school set in a beautiful old neighborhood in Vienna.
These are the formal gardens.
Everything is “old Vienna.”
The choir has been in existence since before 1500 and was always supported by the royalty. During these centuries the boys were dressed as little soldiers in the king’s army. After the fall of the monarchy the uniforms were changed to sailor suits. This was not because they had a navy but because sailor suits were normal attire for children at that time.
We were escorted into an oval room with perfect acoustics and serenaded by 18 boys in the choir.
Of course the music was angelic. Their voices were were so pure and clear. I think I will never forget the sound of their voices.
I had hoped for that but I learned things I never expected.
They started the performance with “There’s no business like show business” which was quite a surprise. They sang a wide range of music as a group, with occasional solos and duets.
The children are from all over the world and tour all over the world. It was touching to see a Russian boy and a Ukrainian boys singing side by side. It was perhaps appropriate because their last song was “We are the world, we are the children.” They consider themselves as ambassadors.
They are more than a boys choir. There is a non-residential elementary school for children ages 6–10, with quite an emphasis on music. If the children show an interest and aptitude, there are simple auditions for admission to the residential middle school and choir for ages 10–14.
There are actually four choirs of about 24 boys each. Each choir is named after a great composer, such as the Brahms choir, the Mozart choir, etc. One choir is always on tour while the other choirs have school. There is also a girls’ choir for ages 10–14 with their own conductor. The girls attend the school but go home at night; a dormitory for them is being planned. Their is now a high school, so the children can continue their education and be part of the youth choir. Some stay, but others opt for a normal high school life (if such a thing exists).
It’s good to know, though, that they have a normal life. I got this photo of some of the boys were playing soccer. They still get to be kids.

With the greatest of delights I just realised something: all my life, I have been living in Red Cities — cities with a Socialist history. All the cities I loved and lived in — Ghent in Belgium, Jerusalem in Israel, Firenze in Italy, and now Vienna — were, and sometimes still are, fiery red, and proud of it.
I have been in Vienna for nearly fifteen years now, and I have gradually discovered a place and a history that traditional travel guides won’t tell you much about. Yet this Rotes Wien is visible everywhere, in every district you visit and on nearly every street you walk through.

For the first time in a long time,
I feel like myself again.
Not the version I had to shrink to be loved,
not the one who stayed quiet to keep the peace,
not the girl who called the bare minimum “enough.”
She walked through hell,
but I left her there —
with the people who fed off her silence
and mistook her kindness for weakness.
Now, I’m done explaining,
done waiting to be chosen,
done carrying weight that was never mine.
I’ve never felt so *light.*
There’s sunlight in my bones again,
a laugh I don’t have to fake,
and dreams I’m finally letting breathe.
Next week: Florida.
Me and my friends, chasing the sun,
singing too loud, dancing barefoot,
and soaking in every golden hour like it’s a promise.
Then — Europe.
A one-way ticket and no return date.
No plan but joy.
No map but instinct.
I want to get lost on purpose.
To fall in love with places, moments, and maybe even myself again.
To write my story across coastlines and cafés,
with no one’s voice in my head but mine.
This summer isn’t an escape —
it’s a return.
To who I was before the noise.
To who I’ve *always* been, underneath the wreckage.
And this time,
I’m not just moving on —
I’m moving *up.*
Unapologetically.
Unstoppably.
Unforgettably.
With love (and finally, freedom),
**Me**

It’s hard to believe I’ve in Vienna over a year. As 2023 closes, I wanted to recap my experiences here over the last 15 months or so.
The Apartment I am so glad I decided on an apartment closer to the center and not closer to work. Though we do have hybrid work, our office is on the edge of Vienna heading west. Living close to the center gives me a huge number of options for food, shopping and culture. I can walk to the center of Vienna in about 25 minutes. The area I live in is one of the best areas in Vienna for shopping, food and the main museums are close by (District 6: Mariahilf).  Altogether Vienna is truly a great place to live. It was again voted world’s most livable city this year.
The Culture & The Food There is so much to see and do here. And I’ve seen many museums, cafés, restaurants, parks and more. Yet I still feel almost overwhelmed with choices. Here are some of my favorites:
My favorites museums are: Art History Museum (center, gorgeous building), the World Museum (center), and the Klimt Villa (which is a mansion built over Gustav Klimt’s original workspace; it has a lovely…

Vienna, Austria’s main city, calls out to those wanting to travel, really showing off a sweet mix of old-time class and super current appeal. As you map out what you might do in 2025, check out what makes Vienna a spot you should make time for.
One solid reason why peeps head to Vienna, very, is because of its old buildings and totally awesome design work. From the flashy Schönbrunn Palace to the grand St. Stephen’s Cathedral with its super old style, Vienna’s loaded with famous spots showing off its super rich past. Each spot there, kind of tells stories from when the city had kings and queens, providing like, a little look into royal stories.

Food wise, it gives all people a taste which provides variety such as traditional eats meets modern, since there’s super yummy places for treats; such as drinks plus fancier restaurant place options where each mouthful has stories in Vienna.

"“Red Vienna”: the most liveable city on Earth, and why we need to be good ancestors",https://medium.com/@nickydromey60/red-vienna-the-most-liveable-city-on-earth-and-why-we-need-to-be-good-ancestors-d7ff11d16d19,"Sign up

“Are we being good ancestors?”. This was the question posed by the American virologist Jonas Salk in 1955, after developing the first effective vaccine against polio. He refused to patent the vaccine, missing out on millions in earnings, believing that the best way to become a good ancestor was to give it away to anyone who needed it.
Long-term thinking, and becoming a good ancestor, does not come naturally to humanity. Corporate executives are flustered about quarterly reports, and seek the dopamine hit of immediate growth rather than implementing a long-term strategy. Political leaders focus on the next set of parliamentary elections, rather than worry about long-term issues, such as the climate crisis or sustainable development. Far too often, we are consumed by the “tyranny of now”, rather than the “power of yet”, to use Carol Dweck’s phrase.
We see this in Ireland, and its attitude to housing. Last year, there was a lot of chat in the media about the €750 tax credit for renters, announced in the last budget. I appreciate this, but it does nothing to address the real problem — lack of supply. Everybody in this country, except possibly legislators in the Dáil, knows that there is an acute shortage of housing here.
No tax credit ever built a house or an apartment. It also means nothing to the person that can’t find a property to rent in Dublin or Cork. This example of the “tyranny of now”, which the coalition government may be using to gain voters for next year’s general election, needs to be replaced with a longer-term strategy, the “power of yet”. One city provides an example of such a strategy.
In this essay, I discuss Vienna, a city that used the “power of yet” to fix a housing crisis 100 years ago. Immigration exacerbated the city’s housing shortage, leaving hundreds of thousands of Viennese living without running water or toilet facilities. I will tell you about “Red Vienna”, and how a left-wing municipal government built a “Ring Road of the Proletariat”, without creating crime-ridden communities. I will also show you how this legacy endures today — today, Vienna is the most liveable city in the world. Viennese policymakers from 100 years ago are rightly remembered as good ancestors; Irish policymakers could be as well.

Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the First World War, Vienna, then home to 2 million people, found itself in a desperate situation. Wartime rationing and inflation had left middle-class professionals and businessowners on the brink of starvation and vulnerable to infectious diseases. Vienna, once the sparkling capital of a multi-ethnic empire, home to Croats, Slovenes, Czechs, Poles, and of course Austrians and Hungarians, was now an overcrowded city within a war-ravaged state. The treaty of Saint-Germain, signed in 1919, explicitly forbade the new German-speaking republic from unifying with Germany, enraging socialists and nationalists alike.
Vienna, now home to 28% of the population of the newly established Republic of Austria, lacked basic amenities, such as food and clothing, largely due to trade embargos imposed on it by the Triple Entente. Hyperinflation rendered War Bonds worthless, eliminating the savings of the middle and upper classes. Supply chains to Vienna from its empire were cut off by the existence of new borders, making the supply of food even more difficult. Communists and fascists in the city stirred up working-class grievances, leading to strikes and political violence.
Just as we see in the English-speaking world today, Vienna had a chronic shortage of affordable housing. Over 250,000 Viennese workers lived in small apartment blocks, known as “Bassena”, with no access to running water. Many of Vienna’s “Bettgeher” (“bed lodgers”) lived in rent-by-the-room accommodations, in which residents could only sleep in their beds for half of the day, effectively sleeping in shifts. These units lacked windows or toilet facilities, depriving renters of cleanliness and sunlight. The units weren’t even cheap; a 2022 study from MIT calculated that rent could cost up to 25% of a family’s income. These unsanitary yet expensive homes remind me of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old child who died from exposure to mould in a flat in Rochdale in England last year.
Like Ireland today, Vienna’s housing shortage came in response to an influx of immigrants. Between 1880 and 1910, its total number of inhabitants jumped from 726,000 to over 2 million, placing it on a par with Paris and Berlin. For instance, Jewish immigrants, granted full citizenship by the Empire in 1867, flocked to the city from Hungary, Moravia and Galicia. The names of the new arrivals read like a who’s who of fin-de-siècle European intellectual life: Sigmund Freud was born in Moravia, before moving to the city with his family when he was four years old. Theodor Herzl, the founder of the modern Zionist movement, was born in Budapest, before arriving in Vienna to study law.
3.
In 1919, the city held its Gemeinderat (Municipal Elections), electing as its mayor the socialist Jakob Reumann. Reumann, a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria (SDAP), made the then-innovative decision to build 25,000 units subsided public housing for Austrian workers, financed by progressive taxes on land and luxury goods, such as champagne and cars. About 40 percent of the costs of building the houses came from taxes on upper-class properties. From 1919 to 1933, the city council was the only entity that built new homes.
In 1927, construction began on Karl-Marx-Hof (literally “Karl Marx Court”). Finished in 1930, it was designed by Karl Ehn, an architect and socialist who apprenticed under Otto Wagner, a native of Vienna, and founder of the Art Nouveau architectural movement. The Karl-Marx-Hof consisted of green spaces, play areas and amenities such as a pharmacy and a post office. Comprised of 1,382 apartments, and designed for a population of about 5,000, it spanned about 1.2 kilometres in length, making it the longest single residential buildings in the world. Other hofe, such as Engelshof, Bebelhof, and George-Washington-Hof, emerged during the same period. Public baths like the Amalienbad, opened in 1926, provided proper sanitation for lower-class Viennese, as well as a safe place to socialise.
Just as NIMBYists (not-in-my-back-yard) today warn that increasing the supply of social housing will create a new generation of “school dropouts, drug users, non-workers and criminals”, there was a moral panic around the provision of housing in Vienna too. The taxes needed to finance their construction were viciously opposed by “Black Vienna”, which consisted of conservative landowners and leaders, monarchists, anti-Semites and Catholic radicals. They whined about “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”, potentially effective dog whistles in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
As noted previously, the planners of “Red Vienna” were followers of Otto Wagner and his Art Nouveau movement. The Art Nouveau style, used to design Viennese buildings such as the Majolica House and the Secession Building, used intricate patterns, curving lines, and the use of materials like glass, ceramics and iron. Using similarly elaborate patterns helped to make the new apartment blocks, spanning the “Ring Road of the Proletariat” on Margaretengurtel in southern Vienna, look like upper-class dwellings. Harvard historian Eve Blau sums up the pragmatic case for beautiful social houses thus: “If you’re planning something radical, it’s not a bad idea to come across as conservative as possible”.
4.
By 1934, the Viennese city council had built about 64,000 apartments, which housed 10% of the city’s population. Like the Karl-Marx-Hof, these too were equipped with everyday amenities. As well as the city’s progressive tax system, this impressive rate of construction was assisted by the city council’s intelligent use of rent controls. First implemented in 1922, rent controls initially disincentivised the private development of private buildings, reducing the price of urban land. The council could then purchase the land at the discounted price and create jobs by building on it.
“Red Vienna” would be suspended in 1934, following the establishment of the Standestaat, a one-party fascist state rendered paranoid by the perceived evils of “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”. Between 1938 and 1945, the country would be occupied by the Nazis, led of course by a genocidal Austrian corporal with a silly moustache. After the war, which left over 20% of the city’s housing stock partially or completely destroyed, the Social Democrats regained power, and “Red Vienna” returned with a vengeance. Projects such as the Per-Albin-Hansson-Siedlung in Favoriten, home to 14,000 residents, came into being. In 1969, Vienna constructed its 100,000th new home since the end of Nazi rule.
Today, over 60% of Vienna’s 1.8 million people live in subsidized housing. Local authorities own and manage about 220,000 housing units, about one-quarter of the city’s total housing stock, and indirectly controls 200,000 units that are owned by private-developers but governed by a city-regulated process. In 1984, the city set up a “Land Procurement and Urban Renewal Fund” that reserves land in the city for affordable homes and amenities — as of 2019, the fund owned over 3 million square metres of land. In 2018, the city passed legislation, requiring that for all housing projects with over 5,000 square metres of space, at least two thirds of the new builds must be subsided. Recent projects include the 850-apartment Wohnpark Neue Donau and the 1,004-unit Kabelwerk estate.
5.
The positive consequences of Vienna’s commitment to housing development are obvious. A 2023 report shows that average rents are just over a quarter those of European cities such as Paris and Oslo. Figures for monthly rents, which by law cannot be more than 25% of a tenant’s income, are often as low as €500 or €600, less than one-third those of Dublin, and can even fall as low as €250 for long-term residents.
It should therefore come as little surprise that Vienna has been selected as the most liveable city in the world in eight of the past ten years by the Economist, including last year. For context, London ranks 34th and Dublin comes in at 37th. This survey takes each city’s accessibility, healthcare, infrastructure and culture into account, and is a testament to the enduring legacy of “Red Vienna” and the “power of yet”.
6.
In this essay, I have described “Red Vienna”, and how it demonstrates the significance of long-term thinking. I have shown you how a formerly impoverished place became the most liveable city on Earth. It is not as if the “power of yet” is entirely foreign to Ireland — in the 1920s, the German company Siemens built the Ardnacrusha Generating Station in County Clare, a project that required almost one-fifth of the Free State’s entire annual budget. The new power station harnessed the waters of the river Shannon to generate about 96% of Ireland’s electricity requirements. The State was poor back then. Now it is estimated that the country will have a €65.2 billion budget surplus by 2027; a pot of gold from foreign multinationals. Let us be good ancestors and spend it.

…Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role…
We had the pleasure of interviewing Martina Huemann. Martina is Professor at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business where she heads the Project Management Group in the Department Strategy and Innovation and is the Academic Director of the Professional MBA Program: Project Management. She has published widely in the fields of Project Management and Human Resource Management. For her Research on Human Resource management in Project-oriented Organisations, she received the IPMA Research Award 2015.
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path?
Born in Vienna, Austria I am currently living between Vienna and London. While in Vienna I am Academic Director of the Vienna Executive MBA: Strategic Project Management and lead the Project Management Group in the Institute of Strategic Management at WU Vienna. For 1,5 years I am a Full Professor of Project Leadership and Society at University College London, Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction.
I am Editor-in Chief of International Journal of Project Management, the leading journal in Project Research and Founding Editor-in-Chief of Project Leadership and Society and hold several board positions in national and international Associations.
I have two children, two boys, one born 1997 and one born 2005.
Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
My career was probably not expected from me. As I was the first one in my family who made it to university. My parents came from a simple background, my mother was educated as a tailor but run a small shop and my father was a warehouse worker for a newspaper. While both not having much formal education, they always gave me the feeling that I can achieve everything what I want.
I also did my studies at WU Vienna and when I entered the building I felt not belonging there, more an alien. I had no role models in my family. However, I decided that I wanted to get more knowledge and a formal education. I studied Business Administration. During the weekends Friday to Sunday night, I worked 20 hours plus in an ice cream shop to contribute to financing my life.
I always having a drive for learning, getting to know something new, but also for visiting other countries and traveling. I am a quite curious person interested in understanding different subjects and contexts, meeting new people and making a difference.
During my studies I spent one semester in Prague and later one semester in Lund Sweden. I was travelling and had the opportunity to engage in different projects, one of those was an EU funded project bringing Didactics to Middle and Eastern Europe countries like Poland, Tech Republic and Slovakia. I was engaged there as a student evaluator. Looking back this got me interested in universities, teachings and in projects and how change can be organised trough projects. Which set the ground also for my interest to research and educate how to manage projects.
When I finally finished my graduate studies, I got a position at a newly established small department at WU focused on Project Management. I supported the establishment of that university unit, its research and education programme. Finally, I received a position funded by the university and started my doctorate in Project Management. I early got involved internationally in the International Project Management Association as I was taken there through my professor. That helped me immensely to build my network.
My first son was born shortly after I received my first university financed position. This caused quite some turbulence. I was questioned by my work environment if family was now my priority and if leaving academia would be better for me. I took a quite short maternity leave and went back to keep my position and finished my doctorate.
My career was only possible with my partner and especially the of my mother and the father of my partner. who helped a lot with the childcare. To make a university career in my context I had to pursue a Habitation, and which set a further milestone in my career that opened the door for my professorship.
Can you share a pivotal moment in your career that significantly influenced your path to leadership?
As an early career researcher, I received a quite tempting invitation to apply for positions at another university abroad. But I decided not to go for it as I would have needed to take the whole family to a different country. It would have been very difficult for my partner to find a job and I felt it was not appropriate to ask my partner and my family to start somewhere new just because of my career aspirations.
This is also the reason why I did my career at WU Vienna. While it was international and I have been engaged in International Associations like International Project Management Association or Project Management Institute, I remained a stable main position at WU Vienna. However as my children are now grown up, I did apply for a professorship at University College London and reduced my position at WU.
Ok, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. According to this report, only about 31.7% of top executive positions across industries are held by women. This reflects great historical progress, but it also shows that more work still has to be done to empower women. In your opinion and experience what is currently holding back women from leadership and management?
Many different issues. Most of them are structural
Woman are socialized with a set of desired behaviours expected from them.
Can you share a few reasons why more women should become leaders and managers?
Women and men are different, and this is good. People are different in their personalities and talents and hey bring different perspective and contributions.
Studies show that women in board rooms make a positive effect on company performance. The offer is to see women (and other minorities) rather as an asset and help to build structures to support them to provide contributions.
Can you please share “5 Things We Need To Increase Women’s Engagement in Leadership and Management?” If you can, please share an example or story for each.
First, targeted mentoring and coaching are essential. Women often face barriers to accessing high-quality mentorship, so structured programs help women identify their strengths, set clear goals, and navigate leadership challenges. I remember when my employer once said, “Try it for six months. If it doesn’t work, you can go back.” That kind of mentoring gave me a safe space to test my leadership skills without the fear of permanent failure, which really helped me move forward in my career.
Proactive networking is another important factor. Women need to actively create or join networks that connect them with senior leaders and like-minded peers. These networks provide access to important contacts and sponsorship opportunities.
Flexible working arrangements are also crucial. The challenge of balancing professional and family responsibilities often deters women from pursuing leadership roles. By adopting flexible hours, job-sharing, or part-time management positions, leadership roles can be made more accessible. In my own experience, I’ve seen the positive effects of companies offering more flexibility. In one example, a company revamped its policies to allow flexible scheduling, which allowed a talented leader to balance her childcare responsibilities with her role on the board. The result was improved team performance.
Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role.
Finally, objective recruitment and promotion processes are critical. Using methods like structured personality assessments and behaviour-based interviews helps combat unconscious bias and ensures candidates are chosen based on merit.
In your opinion, what systemic changes are needed to facilitate more equitable access for women to leadership roles?
Companies must embrace legislation that promotes gender diversity, like the EU’s push for more women on boards. However, quotas alone aren’t enough — accountability is key to preventing tokenism.
Corporate cultures need to evolve to value leadership traits that women excel in, such as empathy and collaboration. Changing outdated success metrics to reflect these qualities is essential, and recruitment and promotion processes must also be free from bias, prioritising merit over personal connections.
Work-life integration policies should be standard, not exceptions. Companies must normalise flexible work options for everyone, not just working mothers. Investing in female leadership development early on through mentorship, training, and networks like the WU Executive Academy’s Female Leaders Network ensures women have the resources to succeed in senior roles.
These systemic changes won’t happen overnight, but when companies and policymakers commit to action rather than discussion, real progress follows.
What strategies have you found most effective in mentoring and supporting other women to pursue leadership positions?
My main strategy is to empower young women to find their own ways and learn to trust in themselves. I am mentoring several women to help them in their academic careers. Very operationally I help them to understand their strengths and especially help them to understand they are not required to deliver 110% all the time. A trap that I have tapped in during my career and which I could not continue especially after I had my children.
A funny story to share was at one of my first panels I was invited to. I prepared so much and worked on my performance in every detail. I just wanted to be able to provide the perfect answers to all possible questions. Which is of cause not possible. However, I did not stop preparing and did not sleep the night before the event. So, when I was sitting at the panel, I was very tired, very serious and concentrated to get it all right. Without any smile, quite fact oriented. I was knowledgeable, said the right things, but my message was not convincing. It was just one boring smart voice among many others. Additionally, when others were speaking, I was so tiered that I simply fell asleep in front of 300 people. My sleep only took some seconds, and I still hope nobody saw it. However, that situation taught me an important lesson which I use to encourage women not to over prepare, take life a little easier, consider the package, how to deliver the message and not only what.
And yes we women cannot have everything at the same time. Children and major career steps at the same time is (almost) not possible to pursue at the same time. But there is also the right time for everything. Not everything needs to happen till the age of 35.
A good personal example is my recent career step, the appointment as Professor at University College London. When I was invited to apply, my youngest child was to finish School thus it was a window of opportunity that had opened, but it is then also a decision if you want to get you out of your comfort zone.
How would you advise a woman leader about how to navigate the challenges of being a woman in a leadership role within a male-dominated industry?
When I did my first formal education in Project Management, it was in 1996 and it was the Certificate Programme “International Project Management”, back then offered by the WU Vienna and the Technical University Vienna. There were 20 participants in class, 19 men and me. All of them having technical background mainly Engineering, Construction and Information Technology, the typical industries in which Project Management was applied back then. My background was Business Administration (specialized in Marketing) and I was the only woman. I was again an obvious alien, especially as I was the only woman in the room, and I was young. In this situation I asked myself whether I fit in? But reframed my question in what I can bring to the table, what are my competencies my talents that I can contribute and makes me add value. In this situation it was my social competencies, my strength to observe, listen and ask questions, thus my talent to lead processes in groups that added value and allowed me to add value. This is also my advice to women, know what you are good at understand what added value you can bring to the table. Be authentic and play to your strengths.
How do you balance the demand for authoritative leadership with the stereotypical expectations of female behaviour in professional settings?
Well use stereotypes like the hard man and the soft woman because that makes live easier to us. But the world is not black and white. If we look in more detail I do not believe in authoritarian leadership. Hero leadership is not working, especially not with younger generations. Hierarchies have become flatter, people want to work flexible, self organised, autonomy has become important, that is reflected in a modern leadership that is flatter, shared, distributed and often puts purpose in the foreground.
A leader needs be reflective person who takes decisions timely and is accountable for them. Core competences are to navigate uncertainty, embrace change, give orientation to others, think strategically and engaging others to co-create the future of an organisation. Today leaders should be able to stand in the spotlight but also is able to share the spotlight with others.

I woke up this morning at dawn…I wasn’t quite sure where I was until I opened the window. The sun was rising in the horizon and it clicked: “Vienna!”
I had always dreamed of Vienna as this elegant and majestuous city, home of Sisi the Empress and fairy tales my mum used to read me in bed. I remember the history books in high school with pictures of the Austro-Hungarian Empire portraying royal families and castles. The heart of Europe.
I left my hotel not knowing exactly where I was headed to; all I wanted was to travel back in time, wander through history, let the city surprise me and instinct be my guide.
As I approached the centre, the magic started to unfold: majestic buildings like the Parliament, the Museum…I walked through a manicured garden that led me straight into the statue of Mozart. It reminded me that Vienna is The City Of Music, home to Beethoven and Schubert and I can understand where they got the inspiration to…

I wish I never met you.
I don't think there was any good reason behind it I think it was an accident.
Like, Fate got distracted looking at its phone, and when it looked back up, we’d crashed into each other, and it was too late.
The damage was done, and we had met.
I don't think it was a good lesson or that it had made me tougher or a better person I think it just became part of the reason I'm not the same anymore.
The reason I'm so closed off, the reason I don't trust people at all anymore.
I don't think we were supposed to meet.
I think it was a complete misfortune.
And sometimes I think about the day it happened and how one minor decision could have stopped the whole thing.
One moment could have saved me.
Because if we had never met, I would still be all the good parts of me, and there would be a few less parts that need to be fixed.
And I would still go for drives, but you wouldn't enter my thoughts like you were robbing a bank.
And I would still have these friends, but we would not reflect on how warped I was during the time you were a part of my life.
And I would still have fallen in love again, and it wouldn't have taken as much reassurance.
I wouldn't have been shocked that love is so different than I had originally thought.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, sure, but I'd be strong anyway, and the time I spent around you is dead to me, wasted time.
I wish I never met you.
I wish fate had been paying attention.
It was an accident that wasn't waiting to happen, a calamity, a catastrophe, a mistake.

Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a city steeped in history and culture, with a breathtaking array of stunning architecture, art, and museums. From the grand Baroque palaces to the intricately designed cathedrals, Vienna is a city that exudes elegance and sophistication. As you stroll through the streets of Vienna, you can’t help but be enchanted by the city’s rich history, its artistic vibrancy, and its charming atmosphere.
One of the must-see architectural wonders of Vienna is the St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic masterpiece that dominates the city’s skyline. With its towering spires and intricate stained glass windows, this cathedral is a testament to the city’s religious heritage and artistic prowess.
Another iconic landmark in Vienna is the Hofburg Palace, a grand and sprawling complex that served as the home of the Habsburg emperors for over six centuries. This Baroque palace is a magnificent example of Vienna’s architectural legacy, with its ornate facades, grand ballrooms, and opulent gardens.
Vienna is also home to a wide range of world-class museums, showcasing everything from classical art to modern design. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, for instance, is a treasure trove of paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts from across the globe, while the Belvedere Palace is home to an impressive collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
As you explore the streets of Vienna, you’ll discover a city that is steeped in history and culture, with an atmosphere that is at once lively and relaxed. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply looking to soak up the city’s unique charm, Vienna is sure to captivate your senses and leave you with memories that will last a lifetime.
Austria is renowned for its rich culinary traditions that draw inspiration from both its imperial past and its diverse cultural influences. From the classic Wiener Schnitzel to the sweet and indulgent Sachertorte, the city is a food lover’s paradise. The atmosphere and vibe of the Viennese food and drink scene is a delightful combination of tradition and innovation, showcasing the city’s culinary creativity and history.
Austrian cuisine is heavily influenced by its location in Central Europe, with hearty meat dishes and stews, such as Tafelspitz, a traditional beef dish, and Gulasch, a Hungarian-inspired beef and paprika stew, being popular staples. The Wiener Schnitzel is perhaps the most well-known Viennese dish, consisting of a thin, breaded and pan-fried veal cutlet served with a side of potato salad. The aroma of sizzling schnitzels and the sound of the crisp breading are unmistakable, and the dish is ubiquitous across the city’s traditional taverns and high-end restaurants alike.
But Austrian cuisine is not just about meat dishes. The country is also famous for its pastries and sweets, which are often enjoyed alongside a cup of coffee in one of the city’s many traditional coffeehouses. The Sachertorte, a rich chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam, is an iconic Viennese dessert that has been served in the city since the 19th century. Another classic is the Apfelstrudel, a pastry filled with apples, cinnamon and raisins, which is a perfect accompaniment to a hot cup of coffee on a chilly afternoon.
Vienna is also renowned for its coffee culture, with a long history of traditional coffeehouses that date back to the 18th century. These coffeehouses are more than just places to grab a caffeine fix, they are social and cultural hubs where locals come to relax, read the newspaper, and engage in conversation. The atmosphere is one of relaxed elegance, with plush chairs, marble tables, and waiters dressed in traditional attire. A visit to one of these coffeehouses is a quintessential Viennese experience, and a must-do for any traveler.
For those looking for something stronger, Austria is also famous for its wines and beers. The country’s wine regions are concentrated in the east, and produce some of the world’s finest white wines, such as Gruner Veltliner and Riesling. Austrian beer, on the other hand, is renowned for its crisp, refreshing taste, with brands such as Ottakringer and Schwechater being popular choices among locals.
Vienna is a city of contrasts, where grand palaces and museums coexist with gritty street art and alternative subcultures. While the city’s famous landmarks and tourist attractions are undoubtedly worth a visit, there are also many creative and less touristic neighborhoods that offer a glimpse into a different side of Vienna. These neighborhoods are full of character and charm, with a vibrant atmosphere and a unique vibe that is sure to leave a lasting impression on any traveler.
One such neighborhood is Neubau, located just west of the city center. Neubau is known for its artsy and bohemian vibe, with streets lined with independent shops, galleries, and cafes. The area is a hub for creative types, with many artists, designers, and musicians calling it home. The streets are adorned with colorful murals and street art, and the atmosphere is one of creativity and innovation. In Neubau, you’ll find a plethora of vintage and second-hand shops, as well as trendy boutiques selling the latest fashion and design.
Another neighborhood worth exploring is Ottakring, located in the northwestern part of the city. Ottakring is a diverse and multicultural neighborhood, with a strong Turkish and Balkan influence. The area is known for its lively street markets and ethnic cuisine, with many family-owned restaurants serving up traditional dishes from around the world. Ottakring is also home to many artists and creatives, with a thriving street art scene and numerous galleries showcasing the latest contemporary art.
If you’re looking for a neighborhood that’s off the beaten path, then head to Favoriten. Located in the south of the city, Favoriten is a working-class neighborhood that has a vibrant and authentic feel. The area is a melting pot of cultures, with a strong immigrant community that has shaped its unique character. Here, you’ll find a diverse range of restaurants and cafes serving up traditional dishes from around the world, as well as colorful markets selling everything from fresh produce to exotic spices. The atmosphere in Favoriten is one of community and togetherness, with locals gathering in parks and public spaces to socialize and enjoy each other’s company.
Another neighborhood that’s worth exploring is Leopoldstadt, located on the eastern side of the Danube River. Leopoldstadt is a multicultural neighborhood that has a rich Jewish history, with many synagogues and Jewish institutions still present today. The area is known for its lively nightlife, with many bars, clubs, and music venues catering to a young and hip crowd. In Leopoldstadt, you’ll find a mix of traditional and modern, with historic buildings and cobblestone streets sitting alongside modern apartments and trendy cafes.
Finally, for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, the Vienna Woods offer a peaceful retreat just outside of Vienna. The woods are located to the west of the city, and are a popular destination for hikers and nature lovers. The area is home to many scenic trails, as well as historic castles and ruins that offer a glimpse into Vienna’s past.
Vienna has a rich and complex history, with cultural influences from all over Europe and beyond. The city’s impressive architecture and museums are a testament to this legacy, showcasing the many different styles and periods that have shaped Vienna’s cultural heritage.
The atmosphere in Vienna is one of refinement and sophistication, with a strong sense of history and tradition. The city’s grand palaces and elegant streets are a testament to its imperial past, with ornate facades and elaborate details that harken back to a bygone era. The atmosphere is one of grandeur and elegance, with a strong emphasis on the arts and culture.
One of the most iconic symbols of Vienna’s cultural heritage is the Vienna State Opera, located in the heart of the city. The opera house is renowned for its stunning architecture and world-class performances, with many of the world’s greatest singers and musicians having performed there over the years. The atmosphere at the Vienna State Opera is one of sophistication and elegance, with a strong emphasis on the arts and culture.
Another must-see cultural attraction in Vienna is the Hofburg Palace, the former residence of the Habsburg dynasty. The palace is a magnificent example of imperial architecture, with grand halls and opulent furnishings that give visitors a glimpse into the grandeur of the Habsburg Empire. The atmosphere at the Hofburg Palace is one of refinement and elegance, with a strong sense of history and tradition.
For those interested in art, Vienna is home to many world-class museums and galleries. The Kunsthistorisches Museum is one of the most notable, with a vast collection of European art from the Renaissance to the Baroque period. The museum’s grand halls and elaborate ceilings are a testament to Vienna’s rich cultural heritage, with an atmosphere of sophistication and refinement.
Vienna is also known for its classical music scene, with many famous composers having lived and worked in the city over the centuries. The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the most prestigious orchestras in the world, with a long history of performing the works of the great composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms. The atmosphere at a classical music performance in Vienna is one of sophistication and elegance, with a strong emphasis on the arts and culture.
While Vienna is a city with a rich cultural heritage and plenty of sights to see, sometimes it can be nice to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and explore some of the recreational spaces outside of Vienna. These areas offer a chance to relax, recharge, and take in the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.
One popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts is the Vienna Woods, a range of hills and forests just outside of the city. The Vienna Woods offer a range of activities, including hiking, cycling, and horseback riding, as well as numerous picnic areas and lookout points that offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The atmosphere in the Vienna Woods is one of peace and tranquility, with a strong connection to nature.
For those interested in history and architecture, a visit to Schönbrunn Palace and its gardens is a must. The palace and its surrounding parklands are a UNESCO World Heritage site and offer a glimpse into the grandeur of imperial Vienna. The gardens are home to a variety of plant and animal species, as well as numerous fountains, statues, and other decorative elements. The atmosphere at Schönbrunn Palace is one of refinement and elegance, with a strong sense of history and tradition.
Another popular recreational area outside of Vienna is the Danube River, which flows through the heart of the city and beyond. The Danube offers a range of activities, from boat tours and river cruises to cycling and walking along its banks. The atmosphere along the Danube is one of relaxation and enjoyment, with a strong connection to the water and the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.
Finally, for those looking to combine outdoor recreation with cultural heritage, a visit to the Wachau Valley is a must. This picturesque region is known for its vineyards, historic towns, and stunning scenery, with numerous hiking and cycling trails that offer a chance to explore the area at your own pace. The atmosphere in the Wachau Valley is one of peace and tranquility, with a strong connection to the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the area.
Vienna is a city that is easily navigable, with a well-developed public transportation system that makes it easy to get around. One of the most efficient ways to explore Vienna is by using the U-Bahn, the city’s underground metro system, which covers a large portion of the city and provides quick and convenient access to many of Vienna’s top sights and attractions. The U-Bahn has a modern and efficient vibe, with clean and well-maintained stations and trains that run frequently throughout the day.
Another popular option for getting around Vienna is by bicycle. Vienna has an extensive network of bike paths and bike lanes that make it easy and safe to cycle through the city. Renting a bike is a great way to explore Vienna’s neighborhoods and get a closer look at the city’s architecture and historic landmarks. The atmosphere while cycling through Vienna is one of freedom and independence, with a strong sense of connection to the city and its surroundings.
For those who prefer a more leisurely pace, walking is also a great way to explore Vienna. The city is compact and easy to navigate on foot, with many of the top sights and attractions within walking distance of each other. Walking through Vienna allows you to take in the atmosphere of the city at a slower pace, with plenty of opportunities to stop and explore the many shops, cafes, and restaurants that line the streets.
Vienna is a city that can be enjoyed throughout the year, with each season offering a unique atmosphere and vibe. However, the best time to visit Vienna in terms of climate is during the spring and fall months. In the spring, the city comes to life as the weather warms up, with colorful blooms and lush greenery lining the streets and parks. In the fall, the cooler temperatures bring a crispness to the air, and the changing leaves paint the city in hues of red and gold. The atmosphere during these seasons is one of vibrancy and renewal, making it an ideal time to explore Vienna’s rich culture and history while enjoying comfortable weather conditions.

Loving you was easy, letting go is tough!
You’ll never hear me say, “I wish I had never met you,” although sometimes I feel that way.
You’re my every thought — both the reason I cry and the reason I smile.
I never thought I’d be so hurt over something that didn’t last all that long.
The pressure on my heart when I think of how our relationship got worse and not better! But out of everyone who could have hurt me, why did it have to be you?

It is supposed to be the best restaurant in Vienna and the only Austrian entry (at No.15) on The List. Everyone we met in Vienna had only good things to say about the place, and we’d managed (I am still not sure how) to get a reservation at short notice. By the time Wednesday evening came, we’d had our fill of Weinerschnitzel and Tafelschpitz and 4 long days of conference food, and our anticipation over this meal had reached a fever pitch.
The Steirereck is located at the end of a long driveway leading into the heart of Stadtpark. It’s ensconsed in an elegant glass walled building that was glowing golden with incandescent light on a dismal wet Austrian evening of our dinner reservation. As I walked up the drive I was almost disappointed that we only managed a dinner reservation. I could imagine how incredibly impressive the high glass windows of the nouveau architectural building would have looked on a sunny Austrian afternoon.
When we sit down we are informed by the server that Austrian law requires that allergy information be printed on the menu alongside every dish. And so it is, in excruciating detail with a legend down by the bottom of the page listing every conceivable food item that you can be allergic to. A short while later, dish after dish of pre-starters pour out of the kitchen. As we start to go through them we realise a curious alignment with the legend at the bottom of the menu. Displaying a decidedly non-Austrian sense of humour, the restaurant has used the allergy information that they are required to include on the menu as the inspiration for each of the starters.
I’m not sure how it got to be like that but I get the distinct feeling that the chef draws a lot of his inspiration from bees and honey. And it starts with the char that is cooked (by the side of our table) in molten beeswax. I’ve seen a number of table-side preparations and been to my share of molecular magic side-shows but this was a truly impressive (unexpectedly so) performance. The char fillets are placed carefully in a nondescript wooden tray. They then pour molten beeswax into the tray till it completely covers the fish. Before our eyes the fillets begin to change colour from their normal translucent state to the opaque white that we are accustomed to seeing.
They give it about 15 minutes and then gently ease the fish out of the beeswax that has now hardened solid. The fish pops out whole and perfectly cooked. They take it away to do some magic in the kitchen and it comes to the table beautifully plated with a long carrot and some sour cream.
They aren’t stingy with their vegetables at Stierereck and for someone who really likes his meat that can sometimes come in the way. Hidden somewhere under the many layers of coloured bell peppers and melon was some Venus clam and I was darned if I could find it. That apart the dish tasted exquisite with many layers of flavour and texture from the mild sweetness of the peppers and melon, to the mouthfeel of Jerusalem artichokes all tied in with the oily overtones of macadamia and black olives.
They followed this up with a mini garden of herbs, porcini mushrooms, green verbena leaves and nuts that I have to admit was not overwhelming, delicate presentation notwithstanding. It’s a dish I thought they would have done well to leave out of the tasting menu and serve only to the vegetarians (but maybe that is my prejudice showing).
The meal is accompanied by little cards that they stick in a sort of a stand by your plate. It contains a description of the dish you are currently eating – with far more detail than one would get from a traditional restaurant menu. They are also convenient pocket-sized keepsakes of the meal and saved me from requesting a copy of the menu as I always do.
It’s from these little cards that I realised that the Job’s Tears that were referred to in the description of the next course on the menu was more than just a Biblical reference but an actual plant (Coix lacrimal-jobi) that is eaten as a vegetable in China and the Far East. In this dish the Job’s Tears had been crisped up and served in a tiny conical wrap that preserved its crunchy texture. I am a fan of carp so I had no complaints with the fish or in fact the entire dish, which had a distinctly Eastern sensibility – thanks in large part, I am sure, to the flavours of Pandan Oil that tied the entire thing together.
I can’t say I was terribly enthused by the Lamb. It was a good hunk of meat, well cooked, if not particularly well seasoned. I can’t fault the technique except that at a restaurant with these credentials I’d have expected a more tasty serving. I thought the popcorn was a treat – it carried the flavour of coffee (which was interesting) and the vegetables were tasty and crunchy – I particularly liked the grilled baby corn. I learned that the sauce was made from the Scarlet Monarde grown in the Steirereck gardens and that imparted the familiar flavours of bergamot to the dish.
The meat course of the day had to be the Venison. I’m a huge fan of well cooked venison – I like the tender, pliable and succulent texture of the meat as well as characteristic slightly games (in a good way) flavour of the meat. They serve the venison with perfectly cooked half moons of squash, baby artichoke hearts sliced flat and a sauce of orange blossom. All in all an excellent pairing of textures and tastes. Clearly the dish of the day for me.
I can’t say any of the desserts really knocked it out of the park. They were all fruity and seasonal — summery even which was a bit of a contrast to the wet weather outside. But none of them rose to the level of brilliance that I have seen at the best restaurants in the world.
Of the desserts on the table, the prize for prettiness clearly went to the Crepe which was served in a roll of delicate strips of crisp and crunchy batter. Alongside the shredded crepe was a colourful row of violet flowers and a delicious puree of medlar.
I started out by remarking on the subliminal presence of bees and honey that hovers in the background of the meal. As I should have expected, the finale to the meal was a selection from the impressive selection of artisanal honeys available at Steirereck.
They rolled out a trolley that contained racks and racks of different varieties of honey, including a healthy selection of honeycombs. They made a show of opening a small porthole at the side — whereupon we heard a furious buzzing. It took us a moment — a very nervous moment — to realise that this was just a recording and that we were not about to be swarmed by angry bees. The server was knowledgeable — or at least he seemed to be given that I have next to no apiary knowledge to be able to question his claims — and we all selected a few varieties to taste.
But taste was all we could manage. Much as I love raw honey, at the end of a sumptuous meal a few licks of the back of a spoon was all I could manage. What we did taste was, surprisingly, subtly different — the local floral conditions clearly make a difference to the end product. I wish we could have carried a few bottles home.
There is no doubt that Chef Heinz Reitbauer is a master of his ingredients. He has two Michellin Stars, four Toques and a place in The List. The location of the restaurant, inside the large and verdant Stadtpark is unmatched and from pictures on the Internet, I would imagine it would have been even more spectacular on a sunny Austrian summer afternoon.
And it is a good restaurant. Some of the dishes (the molten beeswax char in particular) were imaginative and unique. The use of locally produced ingredients and the quaint connection with honeybees is charming. Not having eaten extensively in the region, I cannot really comment with authority but I will not be putting up any arguments if someone claims it is the best restaurant in Austria.
But is it deserving of its place on the list (which, I should remind you, is down from its highest rank at No. 9 in 2013)? I am not convinced. I have eaten at places far lower down the list that have turned out food that is equally exquisite but done so consistently, course upon course without a hitch.
No. 15? Maybe not.

An Austrian Wildlife Icon
These cute animals are European Ground Squirrels, which I saw whilst on holiday in Vienna.
I hadn’t even heard of them until quite recently. Over the last few years, the British media have been publishing more and more photos of ground squirrels and other wildlife in Vienna. Eventually, I couldn’t resist heading over to Austria to see what was going on for myself.
There are plenty of public parks in Vienna, but, as far as I know, only a couple of them have ground squirrels. All of my photos were taken at the Blumengärten Hirschstetten, which you can get to quite easily by tram.
Visit in spring or summer, and you should have a great chance of seeing the squirrels. I spotted several within minutes of arriving, and one of them ran right up to my feet as if it was welcoming me to the park.
I assume the squirrels are used to people feeding them, although there are signs asking you not to.

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

The Viennese street names not only serve as orientation in the street network, but they also tell stories and describe the character of the city.
The narrow Hafnersteig leads to the center of the “Fleischmarkt”. It was mentioned for the first time in 1220. Therefore, it’s the oldest meat market in Vienna.
In the basement of the house, that dates from the 17th century, is housed a well-known tavern, the “Yellow Eagle”, later known as “The Golden Eagle.
Learn a little patience. You never know what might be around the corner. Still, around it, there may wait, a new road or a secret gate.
The bakery in “Schönlaternegasse” was well known for its good bread. According to the legend, the basilisk was found in the well of a bakery by a young maid.
The Basilisk a mythological lizard type beast that was supposedly a cross-breeding of a cock, a toad, and a snake.
Georg, one of the baker’s helpers, who was secretly in love with the maid, volunteered to undertake this task to gain the Master’s approval of their marriage plan.
Down in the well, the basilisk looked into the mirror and when he saw how ugly he really was, burst up.
The well was filled in with stones, and our hero Georg married the young maid.
The blocks of houses in the so-called “Blutgassen” quarter in the first district, between Singerstraße, Blutgasse, Grünangergasse, and Domgasse, are among the oldest in Vienna.
Their foundations date back to the 12th century. The buildings erected on them date from the 16th and 17th centuries.
To which circumstance the blood alley (Blutgasse) owes its name has not yet been established. According to the legend, in Medieval times (1312) the Templars (monks) were brutally slaughtered in their courtyard (Fähnrichhof) and the blood ran down the little lane like a stream.
Nearby the St. Stephen’s Cathedral is the small street named Domgasse.
At the address “Domgasse 5” you can visit the only one existing Mozart’s apartments in Vienna. From 1784 to 1787, the composer lived in this Haus with his wife Constanza. During this period, Mozart wrote many works including his opera “The Marriage of Figaro”.
The first documented mention of a house on this property dates back to the 14th century. Since 1458 the bakers have settled in this area. According to the reports, this place is the birthplace of the famous Viennese croissants (Kipferl).
It is very unlikely, however, that this shape did not appear first at 1683 (allegedly to mock the Turks by the chosen shape of a crescent), as we already know that from the 13th century the bakers gave “chipfen” to dignitaries as a Christmas present.
Above the portal, there is a house sign with old pastry molds, which reminds us of the tradition.
From left to right and from top to bottom the following pastries are visible: Bosniakerl, Schusterlaberl, Kipfel, Brezel, Beugel and, a Girafferl.
The southern tower of St. Stephen’s Cathedral (136.7 m) is, without doubt, the main landmark of the city of Vienna.
Tradition speaks for Rudolf IV as the founder of the tower, the duke himself has laid the foundation stone in 1368. Its construction lasted 65 years, from 1368 to 1433.
At that time the south tower was the highest tower Europa’s, meanwhile, it’s between the top ten church buildings. The tallest church is in Ulm, Germany (161,5 m.)
During the Austria — Hungary monarchy no building was allowed to be built higher than St. Stephen’s Cathedral.

It’s hard to believe that I’ve now been in Vienna for over a year. I’ve seen so much, but there is so much more of the city to explore.
Often I spend Saturdays walking around trying to see something new. Yesterday was exactly that.
I discovered there is an English-language bookstore here so I headed there first. I do speak and read German fluently, but I prefer English books (also to keep my English going, since I mainly live and work in German here).
The shop is appropriately called Shakespeare & Company, located in the center of Vienna at Sterngasse 2 not too far from the Danube canal. It is stuffed full of all kinds of books both fiction and non-fiction. It was a fun place to browse!
Then I wandered around that area, which I hadn’t really seen in detail so far, heading toward a meeting with a friend. The café we wanted to go to was sadly closed, so we headed across the canal to the 2nd district and a lovely café/bistro called Goldener Papagei (Golden Parrot) at Praterstrasse 17. We sat outside, though it was a very windy day. There are many tables under some lovely trees: a perfect spot for a chat and a drink.
The perfect day came to a close meeting an American friend from Germany for dinner at one of my favorite Israeli restaurants, Makom, at Schottenfeldgasse 18 in the 7th district.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train.
We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars (they didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing).
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: Tell me about your dad.
Me: Jeez, I don’t really like talking about him.
Caroline: I can tell. But still… Try.
Me: Ok, tell me when to stop. He was a real piece of shit. Aside from being a 500 lbs. shut-in, he was a manipulative, habitual liar. Everything he did, he did in the name of self-interest. He smelled like literal shit and piss, and only got dressed a few times a year, usually for doctor appointments. His legs were so big, they were ripping open. He’d secretly order food then bury the remains deep in the trash. He was addicted to pornography (I found out after he died, when I was looking through his computer). When my girlfriend called the house, he’d listen in then deny it. I could always hear him breathing because he’d forget to press mute.
I have zero happy memories of him and prayed for his death for almost 10 years. He used to stay up all night, whaling and crying in the basement (where he lived), prompting me to cover all the vents with pillows. One time a friend heard him from outside and asked me if there was a dying animal in the house. There was, but I couldn’t admit it. During his final moments, when he pled to me for forgiveness, I did not absolve him or try to make him feel any better. I told him to be quiet, that his time had passed. When he died, I didn’t cry or feel sad, only relieved. His memory haunt me forever.
Caroline: Ok. That was a lot.
Me: I know.
Caroline: Is that why you use drugs?
Me: Hmm, I guess?
At the time I didn’t realize the direct connection between my mourning process and my drug use. I was still in the denial phase, and not in the sense of I couldn’t believe he died, rather, I was denying my own feelings. I’d done so much mourning while he was still alive that I’d assumed that part was done with. It was not. Drugs helped me cope with that, without me even realizing. Adderall kept me focused and productive, weed prevented me from being angry all the time, and alcohol allowed me not to care about life in general. Because of my regimented nature, I needed them all, every day, in the same amount, at the same times. Being a drug addict, more than anything, made life tolerable. I could focus on one thing: getting high, and not worry about all my sadness and pent-up anger.
We arrived in Vienna with no plans, and nowhere to stay, so we walked around the city center looking for a hostel. When we got tired of carrying our bags, we stopped in a bar to rest and ask for directions. Before Google and Yelp, it was bartenders who could tell you about every business within a 5-mile radius. “Don’t go to that one. Go to this one. Ask for Ron. Tell him I sent you.” There’s very little of that anymore.
The music disturbed me as soon as we walked in.
Me: What is this hot garbage they’re playing.
Caroline: It sounds like David Hasselhoff.
Me: You’re not going to believe this, but, in America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch. Isn’t that crazy?
Caroline: Are you being serious right now?
Me: Yeah, the same exact name.
Caroline: IT’S THE SAME PERSON.
Me: Wait… So, he’s a musician too?
Caroline: He’s the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He’s put out more than 20 albums.
Me: Are you sure there aren’t two of them?
Caroline: Also, we have Baywatch in Australia. I don’t live on the moon.
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. Regardless, his music was terrible, like a cheesier version of Depeche Mode. When I walked over to the Jukebox to put an end to it, I was shocked to find that all the albums were Hasselhoff. It was a fucking Hasselhoff bar. I felt like I was on a bad acid trip. We had one drink, as to not be rude, and while doing so met a few fellow backpackers. They were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner, and offered to take us there. To our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point. It had a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and my Adderall supply was dwindling. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of energy too.
That night we shared a couple bottles of wine (that was considered “not drinking” for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border), along with some ultra-thin paper to match, and I wanted to put them to use. (I love thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in your hand. My favorite type of paper when I was a kid was tracing paper. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers would tell me I couldn’t. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular lined paper and crumple it before writing on it. It made it softer. I don’t know why that mattered to me so much, but I bet it’s the same reason I don’t like museums.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far. Pat was, and still is, my best friend. He was the one I confided in after my dad died, and the first person I told the whole messy story to. He helped me mourn and continues to. I don’t know where I’d be without him.
Here’s an excerpt:
…You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It wasn’t that bad (it was). I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She has a great ass, in addition to being an awesome person. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
I told her about you, and she said to send her regards. We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though. Speaking of which, tell your mom I say hi. I hope your weird, home-schooled, born-again Christian girlfriend is magically becoming less lame, but I doubt it…
There were only a few beds available when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. After giving her a kiss, I said goodnight and went my own way. Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. If I’d had multiple outfits, I would have laid one out in anticipation.
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught her the rules of chess. She’d never played before, and though I wasn’t that good, I enjoyed teaching people how to play. Kevin taught me how to play. He’s beat me every single time then say something nice like “wow you’re so good now.” It only pissed me off more, though he meant it.
We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be. I could tell how much Caroline enjoyed feeling me press up against her. At one point she reached behind me to pull me closer, and I got an erection.
Me: I never thought I’d get a boner while playing chess.
Caroline: What is wrong with you?
Me: It’s a natural reaction to friction.
Caroline: Jesus, that’s not what I meant. Why do you say these things out loud?
Me: Isn’t that just part of my charm?
Caroline: I guess so, Mr. McEnroe. I guess so.
We went to a museum that afternoon but for the life of me I cannot remember which one, or what was inside. It could have been dinosaur bones or art; I have no clue. Museums are all the same to me, just a bunch of shit you can’t touch.
A Mitch Hedberg joke comes to mind…
“I was at a craft fair and there was a jar of Jellybeans. The guy said, ‘Guess how many Jellybeans are in the jar, and win a prize’. Aw, come on man, let me just have some.”
I mean, I want to party, not look at a party.
I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards bought a sausage with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few families laughed and pointed. When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about weed, I would have gotten high earlier.
While wondering around, we passed a skateboard shop that was loudly playing Raekwon’s, “Verbal Intercourse,” perhaps my favorite Wu-adjacent song. It pulled me in like a magnet. The Asian dude behind the counter gave us a welcoming look as soon as we walked in.
Me: Yo, I love this song.
Guy: Me too. He’s going to be at The Melkveg in Amsterdam next week. You going?
Me: I didn’t know about it, but I am now.
Guy: I’m going too. Maybe I’ll see you there.
Me: Hell yeah.
Guy: Do you need weed?
Drugs always find me.
Me: I do. Do you sell it?
He reached under the counter and pulled out a backpack filled with nearly a pound of weed.
Guy: I do.
He broke out a scaled and weighed 4 grams.
Guy: Will this get you to Amsterdam?
Me: You’d better double it.
Guy: Ha, ok. I feel you.
After making the exchange, we chatted for a few minutes. He asked me where I was from, and when I told him I’d just come from Brooklyn, he couldn’t believe how close I lived to the Wu-Tang Clan.
Guy: Have you ever been to Staten Island?
Me: No one not from Staten Island has ever been to Staten Island.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She’d made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?
When we got there around 8pm we were the only ones in the place. The entire bar was empty, the tables and booths too. The bartender welcomed us like he’d been waiting for company and waved us over to the bar. He looked visibly disappointed when we beelined for a booth. Neither of us were in the mood for small talk, so each time we needed drinks, I walked up to the bar to order. It became increasingly awkward with each trip, so I started ordering in bunches, which seemed to only bother him more. We were taking shots of Caroline’s favorite drink, Sambuca, my least favorite. “You have to drink it,” she told me, “It’s named after you.”
We got really drunk really fast, and after a few rounds we were making out at the table. The bartender gave us nasty “get a room” looks, but we ignored him. Then I devised a plan, one that has been devised many a time before, but never by me.
Me: Meet me in the bathroom.
I said it with confidence. It didn’t require a response. It was a command.
When she burst in, I pulled her pants down and put her in the sink, something I hadn’t premeditated. I was in a flow state.
I don’t care to divulge all the details of the experience, but I will say that there was no penetration. We got each other off, but didn’t cross that line. It was an unspoken agreement we had. Plus, I didn’t have a condom, and I was militant about using them. I’d go limp if I didn’t have one on. I know, weird.
After getting ourselves together, we exited the bathroom, where we were greeted by the bartender, who was holding our bill, visibly furious. I paid it, standing in front of the bathroom door, and we ran out, laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, at least in my experience. Caroline was laughing. She had no shame. I took her back and we chugged water in the waiting room.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean tonight?
Caroline: No, I mean “us”. Like, tonight we go to bed, and never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: What if we end up in the same place again?
Caroline: Then we can pick up right where we left off.
Me: Should we exchange emails?
Caroline: No.
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Exactly.
Me: (Kissing her cheek) Ok, goodbye Caroline.
Caroline: Goodbye Johnny Mac.
At the time I wasn’t sure if she was trying to get rid of me, or what her motivations were. Now I realize it had to do with timing (timing is everything). She knew when to get offstage. It was me that wanted an encore. Man, she was cool.

The Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons, dubbed “Humanity at the Crossroads,” addressed the urgent need to regulate deadly autonomous weapons systems. As a youth delegate, I gained valuable insights into this critical issue. Here’s a snapshot of what I learned:
Understanding the Big Picture
The conference shed light on the serious challenges posed by autonomous weapons. They could make conflicts worse, harm civilians, and disrupt efforts to keep peace worldwide.
Why Human Control Matters
A key lesson was the importance of humans staying in charge of decisions about using force. Letting machines make life-or-death choices raises big moral and legal questions. We need clear rules to make sure people are responsible and to stop these weapons from causing harm.
Talking Ethics
We spent time discussing what’s right and wrong when it comes to autonomous weapons. We talked about how to respect people’s dignity and protect them from these weapons’ dangers. We also thought about how using these weapons might change society in the long run and change our relationship with technology.
Challenges We Face
Even though many people agree on the need for rules, there are still big challenges ahead. Some powerful governments and tech companies control a lot of the conversation. It’s tough for other voices, like from everyday people and community groups, to be heard.
Youth Power
Young people like us played a big part in the conference. Our fresh ideas and energy showed how important it is to get everyone involved in the discussion to address autonomous weapons. We left feeling inspired and ready to push for change in our communities.
What Comes Next
The conference wasn’t just talk, it was a call to action. We agreed to work even harder to establish strong global rules for autonomous weapons. But it won’t happen overnight. We need to keep up the pressure and work together to make real change.
In sum, the Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons was a chance to learn, share ideas, and get ready for action. We learned how crucial it is to keep humans in control of decisions about life and death in warfare. As we move forward, let’s stay focused on making the world safer and fairer for everyone.

“Be a fool. For love. For yourself.” -Bourdain
I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So, even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train. We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars. They didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like Coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing.
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: How are you doing since your dad died? Wanna let anything out?
Me: Well… I’m doing terrible, actually. He left me with all this pain and anger I don’t deserve or know what to do with. I thought he’d take it with him when he died, but somehow, he transferred it to me, and now I feel worse than I did when he was alive. If I’d known I’d feel this way in the end, I wouldn’t have cared about him so much; I wouldn’t have spent my whole life concerned about his health. What was the fucking point? Why did I put myself through all that when I didn’t have to?
Caroline: Sam, you learned how to be empathetic, and compassionate. You care about people deeply, that’s very rare. Those are all wonderful qualities you should be proud of. You took on responsibilities that no child should have to take on, but they only made you stronger, whether you see it now or not. Death is a part of life, and it sounds like you looked it right in the eye. It’s an experience you’ll cherish one day. I believe that. With time, the pain will ease, and you’ll begin to see the experience in a different light. Trust me.
Me: How do you know this?
Caroline: I’m an owl.
Me: So, what do I do in the meantime, until the pain eases?
Caroline: I don’t know, just keep hopping around. You’ll figure it out.

While having a drink, we met a few fellow backpackers who were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner. They kindly walked us there, and to our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point, like almost hotel-level nice. There was a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and I was ahead of my planned Adderall pace because I was too kind to Simon. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of juice too.
That night we shared a few bottles of wine (that was considered not drinking for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border, along with some ultra-thin paper, and I wanted to put them to use. I LOVE thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in my hand. As a kid, tracing paper was my jam. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers wouldn’t let me. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular notebook paper and crumple it to make it softer.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far.
Aye,
You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It was as bad as you think it would be, maybe worse. I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, though, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though.
I talked to Caroline about my dad’s death yesterday. She, you, and 2 random ladies I met in Paris are the only ones who know how I’ve been feeling. I’m trying my hardest to share, but I don’t want to be a constant downer, ya know? Caroline told me it’ll get easier, like you did, but I just hope I’m not too far gone before the tide turns. Her brother died tragically, but she has more perspective than me because she’s an owl. I’m a frog, by the way. I’ll explain later.
I told Caroline about you, and she said to send her regards. So… Regards. I miss you, man. See you on the flip side.
Sam
The place was nearly full when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. We each had to take a single bed in one that was already occupied. So, after kissing goodnight, we parted ways.
Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. God, what an amazing feeling that was… Walking the halls before school, passing by your crush’s locker over and over, trying to make your meeting seem unplanned. “Oh me, I was just going to chemistry. Funny seeing you here,” you say, as if you’re not mentally orgasming. If they made a drug to capture that feeling, we’d all be addicted.
April 8, 2006
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught Caroline the rules of chess. Kevin was the one who taught me how to play. He’d beat me every single time then say something nice like “you’re really improving.” It only pissed me off more, but he meant it. We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be.

I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards I bought a sausage accompanied with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few teens laughed and pointed while I poured water on my face to cool down. One kid called me a “Mus-tard.” I’ll never forget that little bastard.
When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about the smell of weed, I would have gotten high much earlier. I’ve always enjoyed spreading weed smoke to the masses. If you don’t like the smell, too bad. I don’t like your smell either.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush, Laura, loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?

Caroline: Do you have a condom?
Me: Shit, I don’t.
Caroline: You didn’t get one?
Me: I forgot.
Then, we heard a knock at the door.
Bartender: We don’t allow fucking in here. Come out now or I’m coming in.
We scrambled to put our clothes back on, then I opened the door. The bartender was still standing there, bill in hand.
Bartender: I added a cleaning fee. Pay now and go.
I handed him whatever money I had on me, then Caroline and I ran out laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, but Caroline laughed. She had no shame. Mid-vomit she posed a very serious question.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean, tonight? This doesn’t seem like a very high note.
Caroline: No, I mean “us.” Like, tonight we go to bed, and we never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: Holding your hair back while you vomit?
Caroline: No. I mean, before we complicate things. I want you to live in my mind as a perfect memory.
Me: It’s not because you don’t want to have sex with me, right?
Caroline: I very much want to have sex with you. It isn’t about that. It’s about preserving a special memory and locking it away in a little box that you can peek in whenever you want. I want you just like this.
Me: I could use a box with something nice in it… Right now, I only have ones I want to keep shut.
Caroline: You see what I’m saying?
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Yeah.
Me: What if we end up seeing each other again in another country?
Caroline: Then it was meant to be.
Me: Fair enough, pretty lady.
Caroline: Goodbye, my sweet Johnny Mac.
Me: Goodbye, Caroline.
I walked her to her room, gave her a kiss on the cheek, and that was it. She flew away the next morning, leaving me to hop around on my own, with my little box.

I’ve now been living in Vienna about a year and a half (my how time flies!).
I’ve seen so much so far but there are a couple of places I didn’t get to until today.
We’ve had very cold weather the past week or so, down to close to freezing temps at night, and so walking around or exploring isn’t exactly what one wants to do.
Today is a glorious sunny (and finally warm) day so I headed to the center to take in two beautiful and interesting historical places.
Kaiserliche Schatzkammer
First I went to the Imperial Treasury (Kaiserliche Schatzkammer) which is part of the large Hofburg palace complex the emperors of Austria lived in.
I highly recommend purchasing tickets online before you go. While today’s line wasn’t too long, in spite of the plethora of tourists in town, you can just walk right in and get your online ticket scanned to enter without having to wait for than a few seconds.
You enter a few darkened rooms which contain all kinds of imperial and church artifacts, such as crowns, robes, orbs and the like. It’s not that big but you do learn a lot about Austrian history throughout the ages and also the growth and collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian empire over the centuries.

Congratulations! You managed to make the girl who didn’t believe in love fall for you.
You made her believe the two of you shared something special, something meant to be.
You made her feel like you’d never truly hurt her.
She had her doubts, but they were born out of fear — fear because she loved you so much that she couldn’t imagine life without you.
She thought she was just being protective of her heart, until one day, all her fears became reality.
She watched the man she loved with her whole heart hurt her and let her down.
Seeing you talk to your ex, sounding so happy, broke something deep inside her.
Every “I love you” and “I promise” now feels like empty words.
She wonders how someone who says they love you could hurt you so deeply, break your trust, and make you feel like a fool for believing in them.
And yet, she stays.
She tries to work through it because she doesn’t want to give up on you.
But your words are starting to cut deeper than you realize.
She’s “too emotional,” a “pick me,” or just the “sad girl.”
The person she once felt so close and safe with now feels like a stranger.
She’s scared to be herself, scared to open up. Her heart no longer feels safe with the man she loves.
The worst part?
There’s still nothing she wouldn’t do for you. She’d destroy herself emotionally a million times over if it meant making you happy.

Vienna is such a historic city known everywhere around the world for its art and culture. Here is an article that will help you to enjoy your trip in the capital of Austria.
Also, remember that I’m writing on Medium and that growing a huge community over there is very important for me. The name of my channel is “Clément Delabruyère” so please follow my channel : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a fascinating city that blends history with modernism. Covering an area of around 414 km², it is home to almost 1.9 million inhabitants. With its cobbled streets, Baroque palaces and prestigious museums, Vienna is a true cultural and architectural gem.
The city is divided into 23 districts, each offering its own unique charm and ambience. Vienna plays a major geopolitical role as the headquarters of numerous international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
Classical music has a special place in Vienna’s history, having witnessed the birth of legendary composers such as Mozart, Beethoven and Strauss. Viennese waltzes and famous operas still thrill the city. Vienna is also renowned for its culinary tradition, with historic cafés offering delicious pastries such as sachertorte.
The Schönbrunn Palace, a former imperial residence, and St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic icon, are among the iconic sites to visit. Well-tended gardens and abundant green spaces, notably Prater Park, add to Viennese quality of life.
Vienna stands out for its concern for sustainability and quality of life, regularly topping world rankings in this area. Its efficient public transport system and green initiatives are testimony to this commitment.
In short, Vienna embodies an enchanting blend of historical heritage, artistic creativity and contemporary progress, making it a city that captivates the hearts and minds of those who discover it.
Vienna’s history dates back to antiquity, when the Romans established a military camp on the banks of the Danube around the 1st century AD. This camp, called Vindobona, was the starting point for the city’s development. Over the centuries, Vindobona flourished as a point of convergence for trade routes and cultures, benefiting from its strategic position at the crossroads of Central Europe.
In the Middle Ages, Vienna became an important political and cultural center under the Babenbergs, then the Habsburgs from the 13th century onwards. In 1440, Emperor Frederick III established the imperial residence in Vienna, laying the foundations for a long period of imperial grandeur.
The 16th century saw Vienna confronted with the challenges posed by the Ottoman wars, with the sieges of Vienna in 1529 and 1683. These sieges were crucial moments in the city’s history, marking unsuccessful Ottoman attempts to conquer Central Europe.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Vienna became the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a major power in Europe. During this period, the city became a center of classical music and art, home to such geniuses as Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Baroque architecture flourished, giving rise to iconic buildings such as Schönbrunn Palace.
The 20th century was marked by upheaval, including two world wars and the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. After the Second World War, Vienna was divided into four zones of occupation, reflecting the Cold War period.
After the end of the occupation in 1955, Vienna regained its status as Austrian capital and diplomatic center. It hosted international organizations such as the UN and OPEC, consolidating its position in world affairs.
Today, Vienna continues to shine as a cosmopolitan city, blending its historic heritage with a dynamic modernity. The city has preserved its rich past while looking to the future, making it one of Europe’s leading cultural and intellectual destinations.
This imperial palace and its magnificent gardens are a symbol of the opulence of the Austrian Empire. Don’t miss a tour of the palace’s sumptuous rooms and a stroll through the well-kept gardens.
This iconic Gothic cathedral dominates downtown Vienna. Its elaborate architecture and impressive spire make it a must-see.
This Baroque complex comprises two palaces and superb gardens. It houses a remarkable collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt, notably “The Kiss”.
World-renowned for its superb acoustics and artistic performances, the opera house is an iconic venue for classical music lovers.
A former imperial palace, the Hofburg today houses several museums and institutions, including the Austrian National Library and the Sissi Museum.
This museum houses an exceptional collection of graphic art, including drawings, engravings and prints by masters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Dürer.
These two museums are located side by side and offer impressive collections of art and natural history.
This city park is home to the famous Wiener Riesenrad, Vienna’s iconic Ferris wheel, as well as numerous attractions, restaurants and green spaces.
These venues represent just a fraction of what Vienna has to offer in terms of culture, history and entertainment. The city is full of treasures to explore, and each corner offers a unique and enriching experience for visitors.
An Austrian composer prodigy, Mozart is one of the most influential figures in classical music. He composed over 600 works, including operas, symphonies and concertos, making a profound impact on the European musical landscape.
The father of psychoanalysis, Freud revolutionized our understanding of human psychology. His theories on the unconscious, the Oedipus complex and the role of dreams left a lasting imprint on the human sciences.
German composer and pianist, although born in Bonn, Beethoven spent much of his life in Vienna. He is famous for his transition from Classicism to Romanticism, with emblematic works such as his 9th Symphony.
Austrian Symbolist painter and leading figure of the Vienna Secession, Klimt is known for his ornate portraits and bold works, including “The Kiss”. He helped shape Art Nouveau and Modernism.
An Austrian Expressionist artist, Schiele was renowned for his provocative portraits and bold artistic vision. His unique style left a lasting imprint on 20th-century art, despite his untimely death at the age of 28.
These five figures left a significant mark on the history of art, music, psychology and culture in Vienna and around the world.
In order to conclude, if you have any ideas for improving this type of article (adding a section, for example), please let me know in the comments. Also, if there’s a place in the world that you particularly like and would like me to write another article about, I invite you to submit your ideas too.

On the title page of Red Vienna, a new novel by Eve Neuhaus, she opens with a quote:
In the dark times,Will there be singing? — Bertolt Brecht
This poignant question resonates deeply, especially given that Neuhaus’s novel is set in Vienna during the years leading up to the Anschluss — the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany on March 13, 1938. These were indeed “dark times,” and Brecht’s words evoke the struggle for hope amidst adversity.
Interestingly, Bertolt Brecht’s sentiment may have inspired similar reflections in modern music. The British group Ultravox released their iconic song “Vienna” in 1980, echoing themes of darkness and longing. Some of their lyrics vividly capture this sense of foreboding:
Walked in the cold airFreezing breath on a window pane…A man in the dark in a picture frameA voice reaching out in a piercing cry…Oh Vienna(Songwriters…

The first time I heard Vienna by Billy Joel, I was on a train home after college, the world outside dipped in the amber light of a tired evening. I had just bombed an interview I had poured my soul into. My head was a whirlwind of spiralling doubts — about my future, about whether I had what it takes, about everything. And then Vienna arrived — not like a pop anthem or an uplifting chorus, but like a friend who sits with you in silence and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
“Slow down, you crazy child
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you’re so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid?”
In that moment, tears welled up — not because of the failure, but because of how deeply the song understood the ache behind it. How it met me in the in-between, where so many of us live: driven but unsure, hopeful but exhausted.
That lyric wasn’t just about me. It was about a generation raised to hustle, to quantify their worth through grades, internships, side projects, and glowing LinkedIn posts. I had come to think of life as a ladder. But Vienna whispered of a different metaphor — a garden, perhaps. Something that grows in time, with pauses, with pruning, with seasons of bloom and rest.
It reminded me of The Midnight Library by Matt Haig — a book about a woman who, burdened by regret, stumbles upon a mystical library containing infinite versions of her life. Each book in the library reveals a different path she could have taken. The novel forces you to ask: what if the life you’re racing toward isn’t the one that would’ve made you happy? What if the pauses, the missed exits, the so-called failures, are the very fabric of the life meant for you?
“When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?”
In Joel’s metaphor, Vienna isn’t a destination you rush to. It’s the life that waits — patiently, quietly — for you to stop sprinting long enough to hear its music. It’s the version of you that grows not by doing more, but by understanding what enough feels like. That revelation mirrored the essence of The Midnight Library: the idea that you’re not a failure just because you’re not on someone else’s timeline.
The truth is, I didn’t need a new plan that day on the train. I needed perspective. I needed someone — or something — to tell me that I hadn’t missed my moment, that there are many doors yet to open. And Vienna, in its tender, piano-laced wisdom, did exactly that.
“You can get what you want or you can just get old
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through”
Those words haunted me. Because I had never thought of burnout as a kind of death. But that’s what it is: the death of wonder, of joy, of being here. I was chasing a life so hard that I was forgetting to live the one already unfolding around me.
Billy Joel’s Vienna didn’t just soften my ambition — it redefined it. It told me that ambition rooted in fear is a form of imprisonment. But ambition rooted in patience? In stillness? That’s purpose. That’s wisdom.
So now, when I feel that panic — that rising tide of “not enough,” of “too late,” of “what am I doing with my life?” — I don’t drown. I return to the song. To Joel’s voice, gently guiding me back.
“Slow down, you’re doing fine.”
And just like the woman in The Midnight Library learns: the life you’re meant to live isn’t the one with the loudest applause. It’s the one where you’re fully alive. The one that waits for you — just like Vienna.

→ Martin Hanley: A Memoir
This memoir was written in 2004/2005
I was born on March 14th, 1931 to Margarethe and Leopold Hahn of Neueweltgasse 23 in Hietzing, Vienna. Hitzing, then as now, was a pleasant leafy, upmarket suburb, our home perhaps just ten blocks distant from Schonbrun Palace, one of the sumptuous palaces built by the Habsburg dynasty.
One of my earliest recollections goes back to the age of 5. Opposite our first floor apartment was a little triangle of grass, with a few flowers and 2 garden benches, which was tucked in between our building and the main road, the Hitzinger Hauptstrasse. The apartment had deep window ledges on which I could stand and lean against the wrought iron railings which were erected for security reasons. Later I watched Hitler’s tanks roll into Vienna from this balcony. As we lived on the 1st floor there were only a few steps to the ground floor and I was allowed to ride on the garden path alone on a tricycle parked in a ‘cave’ under the building. After the war I visited our old home with Susi my wife, and found the ‘cave’ to be a little opening in the building near the staircase outside.
Apart from the “Schonbrun” palace of the Emperors, Hitzing boasted a zoo and many coffee houses of note. The coffee house was an important factor in my parents’ generations enjoyment of life. Its ambience, seating arrangements, free offering of daily newspapers to its clientele, not to mention the quality of its coffee and ‘mehlspeisen’ or cakes was serious business, similar in importance to the Anglo Saxon pub or the American local bar.
Listening to stories of the older generation I realized that although acquisition of luxuries and assets were not on the agenda, my parents and their circles lived a very agreeable life. I have pictures of family holidays taken in villages, on lovely lakes, of my parents at parties and so on. It can be explained by understanding the culture of European middle class life. In Austria, especially Vienna, the culture of theatre, music, stays in the country in summer and skiing from peasant huts in the mountains in winter was maintained to a greater or smaller degree.
Living on the outskirts of Vienna there were advantages for me, as in winter I could be taken on my sled to the ‘Rotenberg’ or Red Hill to slide up and down in the snow on fine afternoons. My Nanny would pull the sled up this little hill in company with other nursemaids similarly out with their charges. Nanny was a fixture, and one of whom I have fond memories. I have a picture of her with me in my leather pants aged perhaps two or three. She also cooked and made the beds. As she had off only one Sunday every fortnight some might say that she lived in slavery. Not so. She was part of the family and had a home which was warm in winter and where meals were regular. A small pittance was hers to spend as well. Far different from where she came from. This enabled people like my parents to live a very civilised life with very little money.
In the depression, working people in industry or on the land saw real hardship. I was given a spare lunch to school to distribute to children less fortunate than I.
My father was a hard worker all his life. In the 1920s and 30s he worked as a salesman in his father’s firm, Adolf Hahne & Sohne, a merchant of “spitzen” — feathers, boas, lace and embroideries, the traditional Austrian lace, still seen in minute quantities today, was used on almost every woman’s garment. In white or colourful on ‘dirndl’, the traditional skirt, for blouses, on caps and underwear. The firm had prospered in the period when ‘Dirndl’, the Austrian national costume, was the mode. Manufactured and distributed worldwide, laces were an important ingredient of fashion for what must have been at least 2 generations, as my grandfather had inherited the business. In my father’s time his 2 sons were in the business, both as salesmen. My Uncle Walter’s sales territory was part of Germany and France. He enjoyed himself very much one believes as he was single, tall and handsome. He had a good time by all accounts.
My father, on the other hand, was allotted the tougher territory, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia and suchlike. Although also handsome, he was already married and the small traders he dealt with, mostly Jewish haberdashers in little country towns were prone to be cashless, especially after a family wedding, birth or bar mitzvah. He travelled for several weeks at a time, in a small ‘Steyer’ motor car on terrible country roads.
In Vienna, in the thirties, survival in business was not always guaranteed. The Depression had driven my grandfather’s firm into bankruptcy three times. Bankruptcy in those days evolved into a sort of payment agreement, in German: “ausgleich”. Say you owed a hundred thousand with no prospect of paying it back. You settled with your creditors for whatever, agreed….and then carried on. My father’s stories to me of his “ausgleich” experiences with his customers, though funny, hid the tensions of those times.
When Hitler walked into Vienna, Jewish premises were “Arisiert”, meaning literally ‘Arienised’ (as in Aryan!) ie. Nazified…Nazi hoodlums, some in uniforms, entered, demanded all keys and normally gave the occupants a few hours to take their personal effects and get out. Confiscated just like that… period, full stop… premises, stock, bank accounts.
That didn’t happen to Adolf Hahn & Sohn, because the business had gone broke some years before. The company went into receivership in 1932. The Depression added another victim, but it not only the lack of business which was the cause. My grandfather, who must have been well in his sixties, married Claire, an elegant woman a good 30 years his junior. This necessitated a new house with fine furniture and the trimmings. The romance proved too big a burden on the business, as well as the two family members who worked in it.
The German Wehrmacht were welcomed by the Austrian populace after the “Kristallnacht” Troops occupied Vienna from March 13th, 1938. On March 14th, my birthday, I stood on my window balcony and observed with childish fascination the armoured wagons, mobile cannons and personnel trucks standing on the road outside, the uniformed Wehrmacht soldiers laughing and joking with the locals while the Hietzing Synagogue around the corner was torched.
We lived in the same apartment until we escaped from Vienna, except for the very last few days when we stayed hidden in a city apartment owned by ‘Tante Ida’, my grandfather’s sister and a very old lady. I was later told my father had already hidden there for a few days previously.
In the months from the Anschluss till we left the country in September 1938, I continued to attend the same school. My only vivid memory was of the same teacher, but he was wearing a red armband with a black swastika on a white circle and the Hebrew teacher’s red star of David on a yellow armband. We children did not wear any outward marking at that time.
It was time to leave Austria, where my family roots went back at least for the 3 generations I knew.

→ Vienna
By 1938, America, England, Canada, Australia and most other countries had either tightened immigration intake or outright banned foreigners. Apparently a Mr. Rogers, an Australian businessman, was visiting Vienna in 1938 and somehow met our family. He offered to help and assisted my father applying for a visa to Australia, sponsoring us. The application was refused. Mr. Rogers subsequently wrote telling my father that stating to be a tradesman as a “chauffeur” was the worst entry possible as his son, aged 17, “could drive a car better than you can!” That was the end of that.
The Depression had not lifted entirely in most of the Western world. In any case, the few who did receive visas to desired country destinations had to have sums of money my father did not possess. My grandfather’s business, in which my father and his brother Walter worked, barely supported the family. This was not entirely due to economic conditions — it has been attributed largely to my grandfather’s second marriage to a beautiful woman some 30 years younger than himself. She apparently required a new house with the best trimmings.
Jews who didn’t make it to desired country destinations had the possibility of buying passports for entry to South American countries like Argentina and Uruguay. Switzerland was open only to the super rich, and then only as permanent ‘tourists’. Refugees like my parents, who left matters too late with very little money, found safety in the few destinations that made no demands. There was Shanghai, Trinidad, Curacao, and small black African states. Israel, Palestine in those days, was quite sealed against Jewish immigration by British decree, although several hundred young people entered and were smuggled in right throughout the war.
You didn’t need an entry visa, you just had to get there.
My parents found a way to Shanghai, as did about 19,000 Jewish refugees from Hitler. A temporary “Thru-visa” was available from Italy. This was issued on sight of a steamship ticket to Shanghai purchased from Italian line Lloyd Triestino, on one of the boats that steamed a regular route from Genoa to Shanghai, for an exorbitant sum. Only First Class tickets were available as a matter of course. I don’t know how but this sum was found for the Hahn family of 2 adults and a child. Train tickets were purchased to Genoa.
I remember a young girl, about my age, boarded the train with us. I never learned what was the family’s relationship to us, but my parents agreed to take her along. She was taken off the train at the border between Austria and Italy during the night, I presume because she was without papers. I have never been told what became of her and I have since often wondered whether she was returned to Vienna and her parents safely.
After a few days in Genoa we embarked on the mv. Victoria, the smallest but newest of the Lloyd Triestino fleet that sailed to the Orient regularly. We owned several ‘cabin trunks’ full of possessions and 114 British pounds. The voyage was a great delight for my parents, despite what must have been anxiety for the future. The mv. Victoria was the smallest ship in the line, but the latest and most modern.
First class service in all respects was still pre-war and luxurious. The voyage was very romantic, landing at exotic ports along the way. In Port Said, at the southern end of the Suez Canal, a great fête was held with native dancers and a feast was prepared on the dock. I believe it was an Egyptian version of an Aussie barbecue with whole beasts being cooked. Local citizens were present as well as the ship’s passengers. I was allowed down to the wharf for a little while and then taken to the cabin to sleep. I never learned why the celebration. I cannot remember the landing in Bombay or the three days passed in Singapore. Then came Hong Kong and lastly Shanghai.

The day that i actually listened and absorb the lyrics of the song “vienna” by billy joel, it hits. That song represents me so much, the things i couldn’t put into words, that song represents exactly how i feel. I’ve always constantly running nonstop, wonder when will it ends, i’m so exhausted, everyday is a constant battles i have to get through. One line from that song that cuts deep was “only fools are satisfied” cause i slowly realizes that i kept begging for validations from everyone around me even the ones i barely knew, i kept doing what they perhaps wanting me to do so that they’ll like me and i can finally be in peace but that’s not what happens instead i felt more empty and sad for myself, letting myself go through all those things just to be accepted and liked. Why am i running? why am i rushing? what am i searching for? why do i keep doing this to myself? for whom? for what? i’m still questioning myself those questions and still haven’t found the answers. What i do know is i want this to stop, i want to live FOR me, vienna waits for me, i’m WAITING for ME, to finally be happy with who i am without the need of other people acceptance.

I didn’t go to Vienna with a checklist. No Schönbrunn palace on the agenda. No museums lined up by hour. Just three slow-moving days, a waterproof camera backpack, and a promise to myself not to overthink it.
From the airport, I caught the 10.5€ bus to Westbahnhof and checked into a small guesthouse nearby. Quiet street. Solid sleep. Five-minute walk to most things that mattered.
I skipped the palaces and headed straight to a corner market for a mustard-soaked pretzel and a table with no view. I sat longer than I meant to. It was a good start.
I stumbled across the Musikverein just before noon. No grand performance, just a chamber rehearsal in the golden hall. I sat in the back. Stayed through most of it.
Across the square, the House of Music pulled me in by accident. I don’t usually do interactive museums, but this one surprised me. No pressure to move quickly. No crowds. Just quiet sound rooms layered like dreams.
Later, I caught the U-Bahn to Donauinsel, found a bench by the river, and watched the clouds shift. It started to rain lightly, but everything stayed dry — my gear, my layers — all tucked into that camera backpack I almost didn’t bring.
I walked aimlessly in the city centre, ducked into St. Peter’s Church, and followed the scent of coffee to K.u.K. Heiner. It felt more imperial than the cakes themselves — but the atmosphere was enough.
Dinner was at Neubauschenke: pork stew, beef broth, locals in padded vests. I sat near the back and scribbled some notes. Later, Papaya served me one of the better duck salads I’ve had in Europe. Spicy, fast, no English menu — perfect.
I didn’t plan this trip, and it still worked.
Because Vienna is good to people who walk slowly, who sit a little longer, and who carry light.
If you’re thinking of going, don’t overpack. A lightweight waterproof camera backpack will do. The rest, the city gives you.

Vienna is one of several European capitals that I’ve personally visited many times, and it’s also one of the most visited cities in Europe and the entire world.
The picturesque Austrian capital is renowned to be one of the most liveable cities in the world, and for some very good reasons!
From a personal perspective, I already know 3 people from my little tiny country (Luxembourg) that studied in the city and subsequently decided to never leave the place and start a new life there. From all over the world people flock to Vienna, either for tourism or to move there permanently.
But what are the reasons that make Vienna such a globally recognized hotspot to live in? What makes Vienna so special in regard to other European capital cities?
Having visited the city on 4 separate occasions, I will today line out my 5 personal reasons why Vienna is considered the most liveable city in Europe, and why it is up there with the most liveable cities in the world.

Slow down, you crazy childAnd take the phone off the hook and disappear for a whileIt’s all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, oohWhen will you realize Vienna waits for you?
I’ve first heard this song when i was 14, right before high school, and to be frank with you, i’ve always been an overachiever.
I thought that was the only way for me to be complimented and appreciated because i thought it was what they expected from me, like how they say ‘’their success was appreciated but mine was expected’’, so i’ve tried more and more and more until i burned out.
i mean, i thought my brain was programmed that way, get a good grade=get a prize, do something good=hear a compliment, it was all like that, till i started high school, the classes were harder and i found myself lost.
i remember the day i got a 50 for the first time, i was shattered, absolutely broken, and i thought my family lost their whole hope on me, i was making it bigger and BIGGER in my head, then i went home, i told my mom and…nothing happened.
this is my problem, making everything bigger in my head, this is a blessing and a curse, but mostly a curse, i also can’t trust people when they say something good about me, like i thought ‘’if my mom said ‘’it’s okay you’ll do better next time don’t be sad’’ that must mean ‘’you’re a failure go lock in and study until you get a good grade!’’ ‘’ so i did that.
and that worked.
for a while.
then i had..drumrolls…a burn out
then i’ve heard this song, vienna by billy joel, i can easily say it’s one of my all time favorite songs because it hits right in the feels.
when i’ve first listened to it, i thought vienna to be a literal place,
then i got older, at 17, i thought it was a place where you’ve felt happy and content, a metaphor
then i got a bit more older, at 19, now vienna means something else for me.
for me, vienna is a place where i don’t overthink..it’s a place where i can be ME, without worrying, without putting a mask on, just me, in my most naked and raw form.
all these intense, unhealthy nights spent studying and fake smiles being thrown in social gatherings, they’re not actually..me, they’s a facade i put to please other people, but when will i realize vienna waits for me?
i love studying, my education is perhaps the most important thing to me, but i don’t love ruining myself over it, no one would.
take the phone off the hook, and disappear for a while.
and that’s what i want to do, cleanse and refresh, just let the flow take me where i’m meant to be, because sometimes i think i know too much, but there are places that i haven’t been where i already belong, if i try to control everything around me too much, i’ll only sabotage myself.
and acting out in a place and around people where you’re supposed to feel comfortable is so draining and i just find myself doing this ‘derealization’ thingy, i just feel like a stranger to myself, to everything that’s surrounding me, i feel depressed, and i think;
who am i when i’m not performing for others, what is me, where i’m actually from, a land of over-thinkers, pageant queens and big pretenders?
nah, i’ll find a new place to be from.
maybe it’ll take me a month, maybe three, maybe six, maybe a year, pace is different for everyone but i’ll take the phone off the hook, and i will disappear for a while, just like billy joel said, i’m tired of social media making me obsesses over my identity in relation to others, i won’t let my soul rot inside me, because we only live once, so we should enjoy it, right?
if you’ve read it this far, thank you, love you, and just wanna say i’m here if you need a shoulder to lean on, thanks for bearing with my stupid ranting for 3 minutes.
until next time, take care, bye!

These days, I’ve been listening to some songs that boost my solitudes. I don’t know why but life more filled with peace and its own passion when we can deeply connected with small things around us. When we feel everything in a sense and deeply. Life turns out being way more meaningful rather than when we didn’t try to noticed small things and took it as a meaningless things. Lately, choosing to just slow down and trying not to be that ‘too ambitious’ for each steps of lives that surely stills unknown. I realized that it’s alright to not ‘rush’ everything at the same time. Not every single things supposed to be rushed.
One of Billy Joel’s song that can portray so much towards this writing is “Vienna”, and I’ve been listening to it on repeat. I tried to connect myself to the song entirely, turns out its that song that we all needed as a person who’s just entering early of adulthood. That it’s alright to disappear for awhile or as long as you want when things are seems so tough for you to carry on. That why don’t us try to slow down and just enjoy every little good things in our lives with passion and pride? What are we afraid for? As long as we can choose to slow down and take times to not rush each goals of our lives.
Choosing for ‘slow down’ or even ‘disappearing yourself’ from life stuffs won’t make you seems like you’re abandoning your life. Everyone’s timeline are different and you can’t afford things to be exactly same as what you’ve expected. Its okay when we knew other people’s timeline are way much better than us, but don’t take it as something that supposed to be rushed or being too ambitious over that until you forgot where your own life path were exactly at.
Take your time, smell the roses. You’re not in a competition.
Life will leads you to the finish line at its own right time. The timeline also won’t be exactly same like what you’ve imagined it to be. Because you never know what winds will drives you and where it’ll be. Growing old isn’t supposed to be that thing that rush you like you’re in a competition. Give yourself a chance to ask urself ‘what’s you’re hurry about?’. In the end, someday the life that you wished all this times will leads you slowly to its own place.
“Slow down you’re doing fineYou can’t be everything you want to be before your time”
Everything and everyone has its own timeline and you can’t decide your own timeline to be same like others. When others are better in their own timeline, then let them be. Someday your own body will take you wherever the place that you’re deserves to be. You can dream on over single things that you wanted, but also its good to least our expectation that not everything will come true. There some things that you’ve had planned yet it turns out didn’t happened like you wanted.
Just grab off your coffee, take a slow steps to daydream and rewind everything, remember what you have and where you are right now, and take a time to be grateful over it.
Growing old supposed to be when you enjoy every small things that you experienced and take of many appreciates for it. Take every joy of life that you have without have to rush yourself. Growing old are supposed to be when you understands that patience and timing are inseparable. Learn that growth will brings you to your own final destination when you’re just enjoy for being slow down without any fear of being left behind because you already know that your patience will deserves its own timing someday.
That every life journey will always represents passion, patience, and growth.

If you’re like me and haven’t lived in a locale with real seasons, I can attest — from my first experience in the late ’90s — that March in Vienna, Austria, is magical. I was born and raised in Southern California and before I had taken that particular overseas business trip, I had never experienced falling snow.
Sure, I’d driven up to the mountains and played in the snow, but that soft, bright, frozen tingle of perfection touching my skin? Nope, not ever — Not until my job as a managing editor for an international medical journal in 1999 flew me from LAX to Munich, and then from Munich to Vienna, to meet with gracious colleagues and helpful strangers, to schmooze and have fancy dinners, and do my job (of course).
After my first night in Vienna, enjoying a lavish dinner with editors and publishers, I walked with one of my favorite long-distance colleagues (hi, Ky!) back to our hotel. She’s from New York, and these trips were old hat for her. But for me, Vienna was the first place I’d been where scarves were considered a necessity and not an…

We all know that Billy Joel is a megastar, but some of his biggest hits came from dark places. In fact, he felt like a failed musician at times. In the early 70s, he was homeless, sleeping in laundromats, haunted by Vietnam and self-pity. After a failed suicide attempt, he checked himself into a mental hospital.
When Billy Joel wrote the song Vienna, he was 28 years old. This song is very interesting and means a lot to Joel because the lyric’s from this song is all of the advice his father gave him on his career.
“When will you realize Vienna waits for you?”
This hook explains to sit back and enjoy the ride. Your destination will be there when it's your time.
“Vienna” is a metaphor for old age, it’s not something to be afraid of, it’s something to embrace. “Vienna” is in the soft rock genre, written by himself to represent his life and of the pressure he put on himself. He understood that other people might be going through what he once did.
In this song, Vienna is about enjoying the ride before the destination. For Billy Joel, it’s about his music career and how much work he puts into it. The destination for him is all the people that listen to his songs and enjoy his work.
“Slow down, you’re doing fineYou can’t be everything you want to be before your time.”
With this line, Billy Joel is trying to spread the message that it’s ok to take a step back and take a breath, that it is ok to be wherever you’re at in life. He is telling his listeners to trust the process; the process got him where he is today. I can connect and relate to this line a lot and it helps keep me grounded. I also think most people could relate to this lyric, as humans tend to put a lot of pressure on themselves because we live in a toxic society that makes us feel like we have to be productive 24/7. This is also portrayed through the line, “Where’s the fire? What’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.” Everyone, yes, even famous and successful people can experience the feeling of being burnt out.
“You’re so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need”
Vienna is known as “the city of music” located in Austria. This is because it is home too many famous musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart’s. Billy Joel is reminding himself that he belongs with those extremely successful artists and he will join them in fame one day, it just will take time like all good things.
This song and the message that Joel is trying to deliver has been so successful because of his use of various musical components and elements. Having the ability to understand and properly use musical elements can help listeners grasp the message of a song.
The tone and volume of the song, along with powerful and inspiring lyrics help illustrate the underlying message. The tone is soft and inspiring. The volume or dynamics are gentle and calm, making listener feel motivated yet relaxed at the same time. The duration, also known as how long or short a sound is held, and the tempo, which is the speed, also helps deliver the message. This is because when Joel holds onto notes softly and slowly it emphasizes the importance of the lyric. Lastly, I think the overall melody of this song helps contribute to the motivational and inspiring message Joel wanted to share.
I think it is important for famous people to be vulnerable like this. It shows the more general population that everyone struggles in life, everyone needs to slow down at times and take a step back and that anyone, no matter the circumstances can have poor mental health. It is important to take care of ourselves and we as people see their idols and famous people opening up about their struggles but also then trying to fix them, it motivates others to do so as well.
It’s crazy how when you really dig into the lyrics and the past of the song writer, it can completely change your perspective on the song and the artist. After doing research on Billy Joel and his music I have gained a whole new level of respect for him. Not just for what he has been through but for his strength to share it and his ability to make good out of a bad situation.

Semaj checked on me today as far as taking a rest day… I didn’t think I had been doing that much, and even said that a few days ago when I was wondering why I was so tired, but I guess I am. I want to ramp up to doing this much all the time, though. Especially now when I have all the time in the world.
I find myself getting off on the fact that somebody is worried about me. Kinda like back in college when I wasn’t eating enough — I wanted someone to notice and save me. Though that would always push me to continue whatever I was doing.
A lot of foods have been a struggle lately; not sure if it’s a problem with my appetite or a fear around foods. Eggs, for example, are so high in protein but have been making me nauseas to think about. Peanut butter toast & a glass of milk has been one of the foods that I can stomach, and while the macros aren’t great, it’s something… and I’ve had it for dinner multiple times this week.
Having scrambled eggs and cottage cheese as I write this, but I think it’s taking me being distracted with writing to be able to finish it.
Mozzarella cheese & smoothies are two other foods I can stomach right now, which I guess aren’t horrible, but I need more variety.
It’s a gloomy day but I have to go check on Moose and take him for a walk. Still counting it as a rest day though — my first one in 12 days.
Went to Stretch Lab for the first time – it’s nice just laying there and getting stretched out but the time went by too fast – and got told I have nice shoulders and biceps. That’s one I never get. Also partly why I’m overtraining right now: seeing results is addicting.
And in my defense, a lot of the time going to the gym gives me something to do.
I am so close to buying March flights to Europe…. Wouldn’t be my Dolomites trip, but do I trust this strong urge I have? Or am I being impulsive when I should be patient? Summer flights are sooo expensive right now though… I’m talking $1,500 expensive. And the thought of snowshoeing and/or being in the snow is oddly so appealing right now…
I really do think I’m going to find myself in Austria next month…
Do I just book a flight and figure it out like I did last time?

After finishing my volunteering engagement with the BEST Foundation’s debate tournament the previous week, I stayed in Russe until Friday, working remotely and exploring this new to me area. Located by the Danube River and known as Little Vienna, the fifth largest city in Bulgaria welcomed me with freezing temperatures and icy streets and sidewalks, which made it a challenge to do as much walking as I’d have liked.
I still wandered about each day, though. Can’t keep me indoors for long!
I also finished two books this week, another fantasy and Charles Dugigg’s The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business.
Monday, February 24
Since the boat hotel I was staying at didn’t include breakfast (because it’s the off-season, I guess), I had an early start, braving the -13°C/8°F temperature in search of a place to grab nourishment and a hot beverage.
As I exited the boat, a shimmering world of delicate crystals froze me in my tracks — literally and figuratively. Every surface, tree branch, and plant was covered in white, glistening in the sun (which, by the way, provided zero warmth). Mesmerized by the winter wonder, I kept taking my…

Nearly ten years ago, my husband and I lived in Budapest for a few months right after we were married. Every weekend, we’d pack our bags and visit a new European town or country. That was when the travel bug bit us. Fast forward to today, we were thrilled to have a wonderful opportunity to visit Budapest again. How could we possibly say no? This time, we wanted to take our son to the places where we made wonderful memories ten years ago. And of course, when you’re in Europe, visiting one city isn’t always enough. That’s how Bratislava and Vienna ended up on our itinerary as well.
Flights
First things first. To apply for a visa, you need confirmed round-trip tickets and hotel reservations for the travel dates. I know I’ve mentioned this before in my Kazakhstan blog, but it’s always worth repeating — look for cheaper flights from cities other than the one you reside in. We could have booked flights directly from Kozhikode to Budapest. But the layovers were long, which made the total travel time even longer, and the ticket prices were outrageous! The cheapest flight to Budapest from India was from Bangalore. The flight duration was shorter, and the layovers were minimal. So, we booked our flights from Bangalore. We flew to Bangalore from Kozhikode the day before and stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport. This turned out to be cheaper than booking a direct flight from Kozhikode (including both the flights to Bangalore and the hotel stay). And since we have a kid, it was much more convenient for him. Happy child = Happy Parents. It was a win-win. We booked the KLM flight from Bangalore to Budapest with a 1.5-hour layover in Amsterdam. We flew back to Bangalore from Budapest via Paris on Air France. Both flights were quite comfortable, and we had no complaints.
Stay
From our experience, Airbnb is the best stay option. It is cheaper than hotels and extremely spacious, and most rentals have a washer/dryer. That means you can carry fewer clothes and sleep in spacious rooms. Our son is a huge fan of Airbnb because of how spacious they are. Hotels simply cannot beat this offer. Of course, make sure you book an Airbnb rental with good ratings located near the city centre or one that is easily accessible via public transport.
Once our flights and accommodations were booked, the next step — the most dreaded of them all — was applying for a Schengen visa.
Schengen Visa
Let me be upfront — of all the visas I’ve applied for, the Schengen visa is the most complicated. I’m not joking when I say that one of the factors influencing the choice of our travel destinations is the complexity of the visa application process. All the countries we’ve visited in the past few years (post-COVID) have either had straightforward visa applications or were visa-free. But when the opportunity to travel back to Budapest came up around our ten-year wedding anniversary, we couldn’t say no, especially since we started our married life there.
I’m not going to go into detail about the visa application process, but I will mention a few things that helped us during our process.
To apply for a Schengen visa, you must submit your documents to the VFS application centre closest to your city of residence. We live in Kozhikode, and the nearest VFS centre that processes Schengen visas is in Kochi. However, we couldn’t find any suitable appointment dates in Kochi, so we decided to go with the next closest VFS centre — Bangalore. Coincidentally, we were planning a trip to Mysore during the Navratri holidays, so we extended our holiday to fit the visa appointment in Bangalore.
Before COVID-19, applying for a Schengen visa was simpler because we didn’t need an agent to help us block appointment dates. We could just log into our account on the VFS portal and pick the city, date, and time that suited us. This time, however, we couldn’t get any appointment dates when we tried to do it ourselves. It was disappointing because we took pride in managing our travel plans independently. In the end, we had to approach an agent to book an appointment, and to our surprise and eventual relief, the agent was able to get us dates that appeared unavailable on the portal. We finally got our dates, and they lined up perfectly with our Mysore holiday.
When you go for your visa appointment, it’s a good idea to bring extra documents beyond those listed on the VFS website. We carried copies of our marriage certificate, our son’s birth certificate, copies of our investments, all our old passports, and copies of all Schengen visas older than three years — documents that were not specifically required, but which the VFS centre appreciated us having. The VFS centre also has a photo booth (in case your photos don’t meet their standards), photocopy machines, and printers, just in case you forget to bring a document. So, it’s helpful to keep digital copies of all your documents so you can easily access and print them if needed.
We received our passports stamped with the visas within a few days of application.
Now, it was time to travel!
Our First Destination — Budapest
Although Amsterdam was our first port of entry into Europe, it was a short layover. After waiting through a long immigration line, we rushed to catch our connecting flight to Budapest.We reached Budapest at around 12 PM. Since we finished our immigration at our first port of entry — Amsterdam — we collected our luggage and passed through customs. We were to stay in Budapest for five days, visit Bratislava and Vienna, and then return to Budapest for a day before flying back to India. So, we purchased a two-week travel pass at the airport. This pass provides unlimited use of public transport (metro, bus, and tram) for 14 days in Budapest. There are also single tickets, one-day passes, three-day passes, and monthly travel passes, but sadly, no weekly passes. The two-week pass worked out to be the cheapest option for our 6-day overall stay. If you plan to stay in Budapest for more than three days, get the two-week pass. Don’t buy a three-day pass and then single-day passes for the extra days, as the price difference between the three-day and two-week passes is minimal. If you buy single tickets each time you use public transport, you’ll lose both time and money. One thing you should know about most European cities is that you will rarely need to use a taxi/cab. The public transport system is so well-connected that you’ll be constantly hopping on and off metros, buses, or trams throughout your stay. So, a travel pass makes more sense than individual tickets. Also, think of the time you’ll save. Imagine having to purchase a ticket every time you use public transportation. It simply does not make sense.
With the travel pass, we took the 200E bus to Kőbánya-Kispest M and then transferred to the M3 Metro line to get closer to our accommodation. We stayed in an Airbnb just a three-minute walk from Kalvin Square (Kálvin Tér) Metro station (this falls on the M3 metro line).
There is also a 100E bus that goes directly from the airport to the city centre, but this is the only transport service that is NOT included in the travel pass. Since we had the pass, we skipped it and took the 200E bus instead. The 200E bus stops just outside the airport exit. You don’t need to validate your two-week pass on the bus, but make sure to keep it with you at all times. There are regular checks, and you’ll need to show your pass if asked. Once we reached Kőbánya-Kispest M, we transferred to the M3 metro line and travelled to Kálvin Tér. At metro stations, there are no automated ticket validators. Instead, you’ll need to show your pass to the staff member near the escalators, who will quickly scan it before letting you through.
We reached our metro station, walked to our Airbnb, and self-checked in. After that, we took the day off to relax.
Getting a Local Sim
We made sure our international roaming was activated before we left India. We needed data for the first hours around the city since we did not want to buy a SIM card at the airport (expensive). We visited a local Vodafone store in the city the very next day and bought a local SIM. It was around INR 2500, which got us 6 GB of data for 30 days around Europe.
Sightseeing in Budapest
We travelled in November, which meant it was cold and there were fewer tourists — which worked to our advantage. However, the drawback was that we had to layer up every time we stepped out, which was frustrating the first few days, but later, we got used to it. We had three layers. Our regular clothes, a sweatshirt/sweater on top and a final jacket. We also had gloves, a scarf, and a beanie. We used regular walking shoes, which were quite enough since there was no snow or rain.
Places we visited in Budapest –
As with most of my travel blogs, I’m not going to dive into the details of our itinerary or write in detail about the places we visited. Instead, I’m going to simply list the places we explored each day. We traveled with our 4-year-old son, so if you’re wondering how many places you can cover with a kid in a day, this should give you a good idea.
Day 1 –
1. Hungarian Parliament Building Viewpoint
2. Mathias Church
3. Fishermen’s Bastion
4. Buda Castle and Old Town
5. Szechenyi Chain Bridge
Day 2 –
1. Gellert Hill (Closed due to renovation)
2. Vaci Utca — for shopping
3. Corvinus University
Day 3 –
1. Shoes on the Danube Bank
2. Central Market
3. Vajdahunyad Castle
4. Heroes Square
Day 4 –
1. Ferris Wheel of Budapest
2. Vaci Utca for the second time
3. Christmas Markets around the city
Day 5 –
Budapest to Bratislava
Our Second Destination — Bratislava
Our next stop was the city of Bratislava in Slovakia. We didn’t book any local travel in advance, so we visited the Keleti-Pályaudvar railway station in Budapest, a few stops away from where we stayed, and bought our train tickets to Bratislava just the day before leaving for Bratislava. This worked out cheaper for us. We also reserved seats by paying a little extra. This may not be necessary during the off-season because the trains are quite empty, and you can choose any seat, but during peak season, I suggest reserving seats. Kids under 6 travel for free! It took us 2.5 hours to reach Bratislava by train from Budapest.
We were staying in Bratislava for three days, so we bought the three-day travel pass at the railway station. The pass gives you unlimited bus and tram rides within the city. There is no metro in Bratislava, but trams and buses connect the station to the city centre. Make sure to validate your pass during your first ride. Once validated, it’s enough to do it just once, as the three days are counted from your first trip.
We stayed in an Airbnb very close to St. Michael’s Gate. The city is much smaller than Budapest, and most sightseeing within the city can be done on foot. However, visiting Devin Castle takes about 40 minutes by bus. You can use your travel pass for the bus ride there.
Places we visited –
1. Devin Castle (must visit for breathtaking views of the Danube) — Highly Recommended
2. Bratislava City Centre — St Stephen’s Gate, UFO tower, Bratislava castle
Our Third Destination — Vienna
We travelled from Bratislava to Vienna by bus. Again, we booked the bus tickets just the day before we left for Vienna. We did this online and took the Slovak Lines bus to Vienna Bus station. Remember, there are two stops in Vienna. The bus first stops at the airport and then at the central station. Make sure you book your tickets to the central station, not the airport. We were in Vienna for only a day and took the day pass at a metro station near the bus station where we were dropped off. The return buses back to Bratislava also leave from the same station.
Places we visited in Vienna –
1. Stephensplatz and St. Stephen’s Cathedral
Our Vienna tradition is to have Gelato in Stephensplatz and so, that’s what we did. We went to a place — Zanoni and Zanoni — that had Vegan gelato and also vegan Pizza. They also had egg-free chocolate croissants. We finished a quick lunch here and spent the rest of the day looking around Vienna.
2. Hofburg Palace
3. Maria Theresa Square
4. Christmas Markets
5. Belvedere Palace
We left Bratislava on the 19th and reached Budapest. On the last day in Budapest, we simply walked around Kalvin Square, did some shopping, and called it a day. On the morning of the 20th, we boarded the flight back to Bangalore.
Travel within Europe
Within the cities, we never used a Taxi. The airports are very well connected to the city centre by public transport (Metro, Bus and Tram). If you can walk, you won’t need a cab/taxi during any part of your journey. The cities are well connected by public transport.
For kids under 6, public transport was FREE in all three cities!
About Europe in General
Please be aware of your surroundings and do not fall for tourist scams. So far, the central and eastern European countries we’ve visited (Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) are not particularly known for scams. However, scams are more common in places like Italy, France, and Belgium — especially in capital cities and other popular tourist spots. There are several blogs online that discuss the various scams you may encounter, so please read up and stay informed before you travel. Scammers often try to distract you with something (such as asking you to sign a petition or attempting to give you a “free” gift), and while you’re distracted, another member of their group may pickpocket you or steal your bags.
Once in Paris, near Montmartre, we were approached by a girl who asked us to sign a petition for something. This is one of their most common scams. Our advice: just walk away and keep a tight grip on your bags. Also, don’t keep your phone or wallet in your pant pockets. Aravind was almost pickpocketed once but caught the girl in the act, and she quickly ran away. Luckily, he didn’t lose his wallet. The first incident happened in Paris, and the second in Rome. A third incident happened in Athens, where a lady approached me and offered me a free rose. Thankfully, I said no and left. It was only later that I realized this is another popular scam where people offer you free gifts, and once you accept them, they’ll ask for something in return. We encountered no such scams in the three cities we visited this time.
As for food, many vegan eateries can be found in the popular cities if you want to try local cuisine. In Budapest, I suggest you try Napfenyes Etterem — a vegan restaurant that serves local Hungarian cuisine. Make sure you try the Goulash soup! There are also plenty of Indian restaurants if you’re craving Indian food. We always look for Govinda’s — ISKCON’s restaurant. They have branches in several cities and if a city we’re travelling to has one, that’s where we frequent because our son prefers Indian food to local cuisine.
Overall, Europe is always a fantastic travel destination (if you manage to overcome the initial visa hurdle) because once you enter Europe, you have free reign to go anywhere, and everything is so well connected. Also, almost every shop closes by 6 pm. So make sure to do your shopping before then!
Happy travels!

Vienna got voted as the unfriendliest city but this one trick might help you.
Culture is beautiful. Every country has its own unique way of doing things. When I lived in the USA for six years, I got to know a new culture. A culture that is loving, caring, friendly, and patriotic. Extremely patriotic. But more on that another time.
Let me tell you about the one big difference between Americans and Austrians.
When I came to the US, the first thing I noticed was that people were friendlier. If you walk down the street, people might ask how you’re doing. For the Viennese, this is confusing. No one asks you how you’re doing in Vienna.
I remember that I didn’t know how to react to this friendliness. What was I supposed to say if I was doing badly? I had to try it. Interesting things happened when I said that.
I remember this one time when someone approached me and asked:
“How’re you doing?” Stranger
“I’m ok. How are you?” I replied.
The stranger was gone.
Uhm, I asked, “How are you doing!” Why would you keep walking? Plus, I said I’m ok. There is more I have to say. Come back, you human; we have to talk.

I recently visited a Louis Vuitton store in Vienna, and honestly, it was an experience I won’t forget anytime soon. Here’s a casual rundown of what I saw and how each little detail was clearly designed to give you that luxury vibe, all while using clever marketing strategies that make you feel extra special.
As soon as we got there, we noticed that only a handful of people were let in at a time — if someone left, only then would someone else get a chance to step inside. This controlled entry isn’t just about keeping the crowd at bay; it’s a smart scarcity tactic. By limiting the number of guests, LV makes you feel like you’re part of an exclusive club, boosting that “I’m really getting something special” feeling.
Right at the door, a friendly doorman greeted us with a big smile. Moments later, a staff member came up, asked for our name, and asked what we were after. It felt super personal — like they were really interested in making sure we had a great time. This personal touch is all about relationship marketing; they want you to feel known and valued, not just like another face in the crowd.
While wandering around in the store, we noticed every item was displayed with gorgeous lighting and plenty of space. Each product got its own spotlight, which made them look extra tempting. This kind of visual merchandising is a classic move to trigger those impulse buys — making everything look so exclusive and high quality that you just want to take it home.
At one point, we had our eye on a particular bag, but it was behind a counter with a staff member busy chatting with someone else. We waited a bit, and when we asked to see it, she casually said, “I’m busy right now, but if you’re on our list, someone will be with you soon.” It was clear that they’re all about consultative selling — taking their time so every customer feels important rather than rushed.
When we were about to leave, a man with a tablet approached and confirmed our name, saying someone would assist us shortly (not only he had our names but probably realised that we were leaving as no one was attending us). Then, he assigned another staff member who, introduced herself and led us to a cozy seating area. Firstly she asked if we would like water, tea, or champagne. Serving a drink might seem like a small gesture, but it’s a clever way to build trust through the reciprocity principle — making you feel that the experience is all about taking care of you. She also asked some very basic but important discovery questions like what we were looking for, is there anything we found, are we looking to buy a bag for a specific occasion or in general and then casually slipping in between the conversation that not all products are displayed so we can ask for some more products in case we do not manage to zero in on something.
Out of our 3 shortlisted bags she showed us the bags one at a time and allowed us to ‘try’ each bag , diving into details about each one — talking about colour, how it would work for different occasions, and even how exclusive it was — all without mentioning the price until we asked. Not only that she tactfully during the conversation mentioned how we can save taxes, without making us feel offended. A neat trick in luxury marketing: keeping the focus on the quality and the experience, not just the cost.
When it looked like we were not ready to decide on the bag we have shortlisted, she immediately offered to show us another option that might be a better fit for our taste. This kind of adaptive, consultative approach really makes you feel taken care of.
And then, just when we thought we were done, and about to leave without the bag (obviously because we came in for window shopping & experience), we asked if the bag could be delivered to us at our hotel. She confirmed it right away and then casually mentioned that she’d be going on vacation the day after next day and would only be available until 6:30 PM tomorrow. This little nudge of urgency was so subtle but effective — it made me feel like we needed to act soon without ever feeling pressured.
Throughout our visit, she never once pushed us to buy something. Instead, she let us enjoy the experience — showing one bag at a time, giving us all the details, and making us feel like we were the only customer that mattered. And when we asked for more water before leaving, she was right there with a tray, rounding off the experience with that extra touch of courtesy.
All in all, our trip to Louis Vuitton in Vienna was a perfect blend of luxury, personal attention, and smart marketing that makes you not just a buyer, but part of an exclusive experience. It’s clear why LV is a legend in luxury retail — every detail is designed to make you feel like you’re part of something truly special.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that, so we took a train from Bratislava to Vienna. The ride was only 60 minutes long, and both of us took the opportunity to read. I was close to finishing Atlas Shrugged and wanted to savor the final pages. Sitting next to Caroline, I was able to do that. Somehow, the silence we shared during that ride was just as romantic as the previous night. Neither of us needed to fill the air with words just for the sake of it. That’s a quality I love in not just women, but all people. Being able to shut the fuck up shows a security in one’s self.
The train station wasn’t far from the downtown area of the city, so we walked around to look for a hostel. We had no luck. When we finally got too tired to carry our bags, we stopped in a bar. We drank whatever the bartender suggested, some local beer I’m sure. That part alludes me. I usually remember what I drink in every bar. I won’t be able to tell you who was there with me, but I almost always know what I was drinking. What I do remember though, is that David Hasselhoff’s music was playing the entire time. I hated it from the jump, but had no clue who the artist was.
“What is this garbage we’re listening to?” I asked Caroline.
“It’s David Hasselhoff.”
“That’s crazy! In America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch.”
“Are you being serious right now?” She asked, incredulously.
“Yeah, the same exact name.”
“IT’S THE SAME PERSON, YOU DODO.”
“Wait, so he’s a musician too?”
“This is blowing my mind,” she said. “He’s like the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He has more than 20 albums.”
“Ok, now you’re blowing my mind.”
“And, we have Baywatch in Australia too. I don’t live on the moon.”
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. The fact remains though, that shit was painful to listen to. His music sounds like a knock off of Depeche Mode, but more robotic and cheesy. Luckily, while sitting at the bar, we met a few fellow backpackers. You can find the answers to most problems in a bar. You can find the causes too. They were nice enough to walk us over to the nearby hostel they were staying at. Fortunately, there were rooms available.
It was one of the nicest hostels I’d seen up until that point. There were multiple recreation areas, along with a courtyard that had one of those chessboards with foot-tall pieces. I taught Caroline chess there. The kitchen was really nice too. There were even nice wooden tables to sit at while we enjoyed the free breakfast provided each day. It was a nice change from having to eat standing up. The only thing they didn’t have was a bar, otherwise it was perfect.
I finished my book that afternoon in the courtyard while sitting next to Caroline. I felt emotional putting it down for the last time. By then the pages were completely worn down and both covers were gone. It looked like it had been through a war, and maybe it had, considering it was a late 60’s edition that I’d bought near Washington Square Park a few months prior.
I’d already finished all of Ayn Rand’s books at that point and needed more words to burn through. Instead of reading though, I decided to write some letters. I’d bought some cool, vintage airmail envelopes (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border) in Amsterdam and really wanted to use them. I got some paper there too. For me, at the time, it was all about thin paper. Whenever I found it I had to buy it. I wanted the stuff as thin as a newspaper. I also knew I’d potentially write a book about the trip one day and wanted some documentation. I made copies of the letters by hand before sending them.
Caroline and I weren’t staying in the same room that night, so when I was done writing I said goodnight and went to bed. It was the earliest I’d gone to bed throughout the whole trip.
The next day, I woke up and took a walk by myself. I just wanted to explore and enjoy the nice spring weather, no plans at all. Again, museums were out of the question, so I just popped some Adderall and let my feet guide me. I could wander for miles on Adderall. I could do anything for hours on it really.
After a bit, I found myself in an outdoor shopping mall. While I was window shopping I faintly heard the sound of the Wu-Tang Clan song Triumph playing in a nearby store. When I looked to my right, it all made sense. It was a skate shop. I entered looking like one of the Goonies after they found One-Eyed Willy’s dabloons.
A guy who worked there was standing in the doorway. I said to him,“You have no clue how good it feels to hear Wu out in the wild. I’m from America and damn have I been missing hip hop. I thought all you guys played in this country was David Hasselhoff.”
“Haha, we listen to other stuff,” he told me, in better English than I expected.
“I’m going to a Raekwon show in Amsterdam next week.”
“Really?!”
“Yeah, I was already there a couple weeks ago, but I can’t miss this show. Plus, I need to buy more weed.”
“I can sell you some.”
I told you, drugs come to me.
I paid him 60 Euros for a quarter ounce of above par weed, and he gave it to me right in the store. I thought about buying some Nike Dunks as a good gesture, but thought otherwise after seeing the prices. I never understood people who spend all of their money on shoes. Then again, I spend all my money on weed, so…
We shook hands and said goodbye.
“If I ever come back to Vienna, this will be my first stop.”
“Cheers.”
When I returned to the Hostel, Caroline was there.
“What’s up lady?” I asked, playfully.
“I heard about a good bar that’s in walking distance. Some guy over there told me about it. He described it as weird and completely empty.”
“Perfect.”
“It is, right?”
“I meant you. You’re just perfect.”
“Aww, you make me blush, John McEnroe.”
“Please…”
The bar was everything the guy said it was. It looked more like an empty Chili’s than a bar. There were way too many booths, and the bar only sat 6. Normally, I’d sit at the bar in that situation but Caroline didn’t want to take the chance of getting stuck with an English speaking ex-pat blabber of a bartender.
Beers turned into Sambuca shots very quickly. She was the one ordering this time, and I was certain she was trying to ply me with enough liquor so I’d finally make a move on her. Obviously, it worked. A man can only be so strong, even the best ones.
We disappeared one after the other into the men’s bathroom, as to deceive the bartender into thinking it was a normal bathroom run. Again, very Danny Ocean of me.
We started kissing as soon as she opened the door. Then I put her on top of the sink and… Well, the rest I’ll leave to your imagination.
After a few minutes of fun, we fixed our clothes and left the bathroom. I can’t be sure of the reason but as soon as the bartender saw us, he asked us to pay our tab and leave. As I told you before, being asked to leave is way different than being thrown out.
We kissed and fondled each other on the walk back to the hostel. I hadn’t experienced that since college. I don’t know if there’s anything better then a fondle walk. It really makes you feel like a teenager again.
When we got to the hostel, we sat and chatted before going to bed.
“I think I want to go to Germany tomorrow. Do you want to come with?” I asked her.
“I don’t think so. I want to stay here longer and see museums.”
She was doing what I did to her, making me wait.
“I understand.”
We hugged, then stared at each other, our arms still intertwined. Neither of us needed words to express what we felt. We spent five magical days together. It didn’t need to be anything more than that. We were both content.
“Goodnight, pretty lady.”
“Goodnight, Mr. McEnroe. See you when I see you.”

“HEAVEN, VIENNA MINE, LAUGHTER AND MUSIC AND STARS THAT SHINE, WONDERFUL CITY WHERE I BELONG, OF HER I SING MY SONG”[VIENNA, CITY OF MY DREAMS, RUDOLF SIECZYNSKI]
by Anja Mayer
Vienna, as one of the most vibrant cultural hotspots in Europe, has for centuries been home to many artists, composers, thinkers and poets from all corners of the continent. Over the years, the city’s lively intellectual and artistic scene, and unique culture has served as a catalyst for creative processes and exchanges, that left an impact all over the world. Besides being the birthplace of revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of psychology, literature and the arts, Vienna especially had an important influence on the evolution of classical music.
From 1780 until 1824, a period which is sometimes also referred to as the Viennese Classics, composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Josef Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven revolutionized the European music scene. It was during that time that music evolved from background entertainment during social gatherings to a highly respected cultural form of art with an even higher social significance, earning Vienna the reputation as the capital of composition. Since then many more accomplished composers, musicians and artist have emerged from the city’s cultural scene onto the world stage.
To salute Vienna’s unique and extraordinary musical legacy, the Carnegie Hall in New York City will host a three-week citywide festival in the spring of 2014. The event will feature symphonic and operatic masterpieces, chamber music and a variety of new music that is emerging from the Austrian capital. The central piece of the festival is a concert series by the renowned Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Their residency, which will include seven concert performances, will mark only the second time in history that the Viennese musicians have performed opera in concert at Carnegie Hall. The festival will extend throughout New York City and will feature other musical highlights such as Beethoven’s violin sonata cycle, Schubert’s Die schöne Müllerin and the premiere of new work by Austrian composer Georg Friedrich Haas. Apart from concert performances, the celebration will combine a variety of art disciplines including film screenings and art exhibitions at different cultural venues throughout the city. The kick-off event of the festival will be the annual traditional Viennese Opera Ball at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on February 21, 2014.

Vienna is a beautiful city, with significant uniqe baroque architectures. Vienna is one of my favorite cities. Additionally, Vienna is classified as the best living place for years.
As the name itself suggest that the castle has vivid and beautiful colors, that give a great idea of the life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This castle has a very green garden, with a huge plant labyrinth. There is a very famous story about this castle and especially about the plant labyrinth. The story is about a stunning empress Sissi, and her assassination.
On your way out of the castle, I would prefer you to visit the Tiergarten ( the zoo). The Zoo has many exotic and interesting animals. The workers in the zoo as well make extreamly interesting shows with the animals.

“My dream writing room would be the Imperial Library in Vienna.” Fran Lebowitz
The word “cosy” means different things to different people. For some, it’s sipping a cup of chai in the comfort of home. For others, it’s watching your favorite series without interruptions. It might be talking to friends or family about something meaningful, or spending quality time with loved ones. In other words, it’s that moment when you’re truly yourself — when you’re not bound by any obligation, when you’re quietly loving yourself, and when you’re living, not just existing.
I try to find these cosy moments in my home, and today that moment came while painting a memory from Vienna. The art is far from perfect and still incomplete. The art is inspired from a church which was across our apartment in Vienna. I snapped a photo, thinking that one day I might paint it. Today, I finally did. When you visit a city, you carry it with you forever and Vienna is that city for me. Isn’t is beautiful you need not pay money to be an artist or a writer. Your own memories are enough. All you need is a pen and a paper and you keep doing it again and again as if that’s how you will attain salvation.
I’ll take my time with this. Watercolor isn’t my favorite medium, but I will try to do my best to paint the memory.
February Weeds & Wildflowers Writing Prompt is Cosy. Sharing today’s memory for the same. Thanks to the editors of Weeds and Wildflowers publication for the space for my rambling.

Vienna is a thriving cultural hub with beautiful architecture and fascinating history. It was also named the “World’s Most Livable City” by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
That’s why I recently packed my bags and moved to Vienna. I wanted to see if the city lived up to the hype. And sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.
Here are my first impressions of Vienna:
While wandering the streets of Vienna, a street food stall caught my eye. I decided I would try some traditional Austrian food. Not knowing a lot of German or Austrian cuisine, I pointed to what I thought looked tasty.
“Käsekrainer” the man said.
“Danke schön (Thank you),” I replied.
He handed me a plate with the largest sausage I had ever seen in my life, cut up into small pieces. Then, he gave me a slice of bread and some ketchup on the side.

Vienna ooo nah nah, half of our heart is in Vienna ooo nah nah. 🎵
Leaving Santorini was an event — the airport was not built to support multiple departing flights and has the worst airport logistics we’ve ever seen in our lives! In short, it was chaotic, people were shoving, kids were crying, there was yelling and no space or direction to where you should go… so when we landed in Vienna… it was the most incredible thing.
It was silent, organized, we could flush toilet paper (!!! we didn’t know Greece has poor plumbing…) we had McDonalds following Maeghan’s goal to eat it in every country we visit, we downloaded our fav podcasts (and Maeghan has a cameo in one!!), and facetimed family from a bus(!!!!) with real wifi and saw our family in full-resolution… no more pixelated heads :D
And that was all just in the first 30 mins of being here, this city got even better after that.
We explored the beautiful buildings, the meaningful history and ate / drank the best things. Vienna is pretty awesome and we will definitely come back.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
Sisi of Bavaria was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary who had this building constructed for her and her husband to live in with plans to build an identical building across the way. She was sadly assassinated (by accident!) in 1898 and her husband stopped construction due to a broken heart.
Later in history, this Imperial Palace was used by Adolf Hitler to perform his famous speech, proclaiming Austria as part of the Third Reich.
And today, all the buildings are in such great shape… looking back, I think the Parthenon in Greece may have looked similar to this one back in the day 😃
Meet Claire 👋 she is an incredible woman we had the pleasure of meeting (by eaves-dropping and totally striking a cool Canadian conversation… 😊). She is an opera singer who is studying her masters in Austria. She shared a few hours with us talking about her work, some challenges and the philosophies she lives by as she trains to as a Opera singer. It was such an inspiring conversation. Claire had such a love/passion for Opera, so much so, that she wanted to share with us and gave us two free tickets to a show!!!
We ended up going our last night in Vienna, and it was pure magic.
So there’s a thing in Vienna, where you can go see the Opera with standing tickets. They only cost 3 euros!

Are there still fireworks in a famously quiet, central residential area in Austria’s capital?
New Year’s Eve in Vienna used to sound like being thrown into a war zone — a staccato of explosions with sound volume close to or above the pain threshold for hours and hours and hours … But those days are gone. Over the last few years, the change of years became relatively silent in Austria’s capital. Officially, the main reason is that Vienna has forbidden all pyrotechnics above class F1 (anything children are legally allowed to use) within city borders. Further, supermarkets no longer sell fireworks, citizens are more concerned about the environmental and climate impact, and dog owners (Austrians cherish their furry family members) have become more vocal.
This is especially true for my residential area — the Nordbahnhofviertel. This rather new part of the city, although very central, is quiet as can be. It is traffic-calmed, has many driving bans, and sometimes you get the impression that there are more cargo bikes than cars. And, predominantly inhabited by young families, it is not a party hotspot by far.
Anyway, even there, fireworks and firecrackers still exist, and people either love or hate them. Depending on the side, the reported noise quantification fluctuates between Animal Crossing and Call of Duty scenarios. Unsatisfying as this is, I have decided to put a little more data into this discussion.
I have used the mobile app Night Hark to measure the sound volume during the night and to detect the sound of fireworks/firecrackers. Therefore, I have placed an iPhone 8 next to the closed window in my apartment on the third floor and let it record the night. I put it into my home office room with closed doors, so there might be some noise contamination from my family and me, but it shouldn’t be too bad. After all, I can code there without being disturbed by my kids playing Ninja in the living room shouting the name of Jutsus.
I will report the sound volume in decibels full scale. Since mobile phones use digital microphones, one only gets the sound pressure level relative to the maximum signal capacity of the microphone (= 0 dbfs). I don’t know how much that is for an iPhone, but my best guess would be to put it somewhere close to 100 dB. The app would also return an A-filtered measure, which is tuned to the hearing spectrum of humans, but since this is at least partly about animals and I have no clue if A-filtered would be appropriate, I stick with dbfs (if you know more about this, please let me know in the comments).
Before we get to the results, a last help for interpreting them: Loudness is not linear. An increase of 10 dB corresponds to a perceived doubling of loudness. So 60 dB is double as loud as 50 dB.
We can see in Fig. 1, which displays the max sound pressure level per minute, that there is a build-up till midnight when loudness jumps to its max value and stays there for around half an hour before ebbing down. During the build-up there seem to be two local maxima at around 19:00 and 21:00 — maybe those were fireworks for very small and small children who cannot stay awake till midnight. After 2 o’clock, it is practically quiet.
Further, the scale was never maxed out with 0 dbfs, so the phone could have been able to quantify even louder sounds. The loudest minute was 0:32 with -17.8 dbfs. If my guess of a max value of 100 dB is correct, this would correspond to 82.3 dB, or for reference, a motorcycle or a crying baby. Not quiet, but only an eighth of the loudness of a disco at 110 dB or a 32nd of the pain threshold at 130 dB.
Honing in on fireworks and firecrackers, I looked at the count of either fireworks or explosion classifications with a score greater or equal to .05. (Night Hark uses YAMNet, a neural network, that can classify sound snippets of 0.975 seconds into 500+ categories. Each sound category gets a score between 0 and 1, with greater values indicating a higher likelihood that the snippet belongs to the specific category). Since the sound behind the window is somewhat muffled and the time resolution is limited, this is no 1:1 representation of the actual number of bangs, but the proportions between time-frames should be valid.
In Fig. 2, we can again see a clear peak at midnight, a local maximum at 20:30, and a hard stop at 02:00.
Whether this is a lot or quasi-nothing lies in the ear of the listener, but I am sure this is comparatively silent for New Year’s Eve in a metropolis. I am interested in your experiences and thoughts on that, so please let me know in the comments.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year — yet advent is even more wonderful in certain locations.
Out of all the cities I’ve been to, and I’ve visited quite a lot in the last fifteen years, Vienna is by far the best place to be in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
Not only because of the food (even though it plays a vital role!) but also because of the traditions celebrated and the visual, glittery makeover of the city.
Here are six reasons why Vienna should be the travel destination of your choice for next December (if Corona allows).
Advent markets exist in many countries, but in Austria, they’re definitely the most beautiful! From small and rural to big and shiny — everyone will find a market to his or her liking.
More than twenty markets grow out of the concrete in Austria’s capital alone during November.
The most famous (and touristic one) is probably in front of the Vienna City Hall with over 100 booths. Another very popular one is situated in front of the Imperial Palace Schönbrunn.
But, why are they the best in the world? Surely, not only because of the locations? No, they have far more to offer.
Delicious food, yummy hot drinks, and arts and handcraft are sold here. For me, this is one of the most important aspects of a proper Christmas market.
I’ve been to markets in London, Paris, and Amsterdam but they all couldn’t keep up with the markets at home. They were far too posh and overdone, with a lot of tech stuff for sale, instead of traditional workmanship.
I prefer browsing through wooden stalls in soft lights, which display self-made candles, hand-made jewelry, knitted hoods, and gloves as well as or local delicacies.
I prefer to hear soft Christmas music instead of loud radio hits.
For one month only, I enjoy a life that doesn’t circulate around high-tech equipment and being the loudest.
Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas in Austria, without our markets, where vintage and traditional last-minute presents can be discovered.
Giant snowflakes hanging between Baroque buildings, illuminated trees guiding cars through the streets of the inner district, fairy lights shining from balconies and through windows in every other apartment.
It begins to look a lot like Christmas when the lights are switched on in the entire city.
White. Blue. Green. Red. Lila. In all shapes and forms.
There is nothing more magical than walking through the streets during December. Even getting stuck in a traffic jam feels less frustrating when shiny snowmen and glittering snowflakes guide your way.
In the shopping streets, every other shop plays Christmas music too. What a wonderful world …
The scent of roasted Maroni (chestnuts), fatty Langos, and Glühwein (mulled wine) stream through the streets like the wind.
Street booths that sell these chestnuts and potatoes pop up in every corner, giving our popular ‘Würstelstände’ a very hard time.
Yet, the culinary hot spots during advent are definitely the Christmas markets.
The choice of punch is overwhelming: Orange Punsch, Berry Punsch, Pina Colada Punsch, Jagatee, Eierlikör Punsch (egg nog), Tequila Punsch, Ginger Punsch, Elderflower Punsch, white and red Glühwein, and much more.
A perfect display of the multi-cultural heritage of this country.
You can visit every Christmas market in Vienna and still won’t be through all the flavors. Trust me, I tried!
The same is true for the food. You can start with a warming bread soup, continue with gratinated toasts or potatoes, taste some Krautfleckerl or Käsekrainer and finish with a cinnamon-drizzled Baumkuchen, chocolate-stuffed Krapfen, or chocolate-coated fruits.
The best part for me is always the tasting around. Many small, often family-owned businesses book a booth and bring their own products.
Just yesterday I tried the yummiest truffle-parmesan bread spread and a nice locally produced Gin.
No wonder my family and I always gain five kilos over December.
This is one of the most widespread Christmas customs in German-speaking Europe. You’ll find at least one of these decorative pieces in every family’s living room.
The advent wreath is made out of pine branches, which are weaved into a circle. It’s then decorated with small Christmas balls, wooden figurines, ribbons, or whatever you want to put onto it.
Four big candles are placed in the wreath, to be ignited one at a time on every advent Sunday while we sing carols, read verses from a Christmas story (or from the Bible), and eat homemade cookies. And drink some more Punsch.
The custom goes back to the 19th century, where Johann Hinrich Wichern placed 20 lights on a broken wheel. Over the years, the size and number of candles were reduced to their current form.
The tradition of Nikolo and Krampus remains one of the most cherished in Austria. It’s living folklore that has survived until today, and sparks joy and fear in the hearts of children.
Every year on the 5th of December, Austrian children position cookies, milk, and a pair of shoes by the entrance door or window to give the Nikolo energy for his travel through the country.
As a thank you, he leaves sweets in their footwear.
Then, on 6th December, St. Nikolaus visits Austrian homes and kindergartens in full bishop’s robe to assess if the children have been good or bad.
But he usually doesn’t travel alone — children must be aware of his servant, Krampus! Krampus is the complete opposite of the saint: a terrifying, horned, hoofed, and furry figure.
While Nikolo brings sweets and chocolate to the brave children, Krampus brings warnings (in earlier times also strokes) to the not-so-brave ones.
This tradition, especially the Krampus, is still very popular with adults, who like to dress up and walk the streets to frighten people.
So you better be good for one year, before you travel to Austria!
Vienna is not only known for the beautiful Christmas markets and classic music but also for its people and their grumpy-ness and Viennese ‘Schmäh’.
We have no patience, we get easily annoyed and we’re not too shy to let everybody around us know, even nice tourists.
But, when everything around us starts to glitter and shine, and when our sharp mind is lulled in by Punsch and mulled wine, our nerves get soothed and our heart grows bigger.
We forget to be grumpy and annoyed and can even be nice. So advent is the best time to meet Austrian people and make new friendships.
If that isn’t a Christmas miracle, what is?

Vienna has a register for its trees. I learned this through my favourite crowd-sourcing app, iNaturalist. It allows identifying surrounding plants and animals by simply making a picture and uploading it through the app. A community of fellow users and iNaturalist algorithms suggest possible identifications.
I was scrolling on my way to give a talk but I still had some time, so I went into a park to observe some Viennese urban wildlife. One of my observations was a tree (probably poplar).
The observation is registered in iNaturalist as observation #22987310. Not long after uploading the images to iNaturalist I got the feedback that I should have listed the observation as a cultivated tree. “My” tree was apparently planted and it is 45 years old and has the tree registry number 30.
It is these kinds of interactions and data linkages, that makes me love iNaturalist and its community.

Discovering the History and Culture of Austria
Vienna, the imperial capital of Austria, is a city of striking contrasts. With its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant cultural scene, it’s no wonder that it has become a top destination for travelers from around the world. In this article, we will take you on a journey through the wonder of Vienna, exploring its history, culture, and beauty.
Vienna’s history stretches back over 2,000 years, and the city is steeped in rich culture and tradition. From the Habsburg dynasty to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Vienna has played an important role in shaping European history. Visitors can explore this history by visiting landmarks such as Schönbrunn Palace, the former summer residence of the Habsburgs, or the Hofburg Palace, the winter residence of the Austrian emperors.
The architecture of Vienna is equally impressive, with stunning examples of Baroque, Gothic, and Art Nouveau styles. The city’s main cathedral, St. Stephen’s, is a beautiful example of Gothic architecture, while the Belvedere Palace is a masterpiece of Baroque design. The Jugendstil style, known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe, is also prominent in Vienna, with many buildings featuring decorative facades and intricate ironwork.
Vienna is also renowned for its music and cultural scene. The city was home to famous composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Strauss, and visitors can explore their legacies by visiting places such as the Vienna State Opera or attending a classical concert at the Musikverein. Vienna is also home to a vibrant contemporary arts scene, with galleries and museums showcasing both established and up-and-coming artists.
Foodies will find plenty to love in Vienna as well, with its rich culinary traditions and world-renowned coffee culture. From the famous Sachertorte chocolate cake to hearty traditional dishes such as Wiener Schnitzel, Vienna is a city that is sure to please the palate. And of course, no visit to Vienna would be complete without a visit to one of its many traditional coffeehouses, where visitors can relax and soak up the city’s atmosphere.
Beyond the city itself, Vienna is surrounded by stunning natural beauty, with the Austrian Alps just a short distance away. Visitors can take day trips to picturesque towns such as Hallstatt or explore the nearby vineyards and sample some of Austria’s world-famous wines.
When planning a trip to Vienna, there are a few must-see sights and experiences that should be at the top of any traveler’s list. First and foremost, a visit to Schönbrunn Palace is a must. This stunning palace, with its beautifully landscaped gardens, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers visitors a glimpse into the lives of the Habsburgs.
Another must-see attraction is St. Stephen’s Cathedral, the city’s main cathedral and one of the most impressive examples of Gothic architecture in Europe. Visitors can climb to the top of the cathedral for a stunning view over the city.
For those interested in the arts, a visit to the Belvedere Palace is highly recommended. This stunning Baroque palace houses one of the world’s most important collections of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
Finally, no visit to Vienna would be complete without a visit to one of the city’s traditional coffeehouses. These atmospheric cafes, such as Café Central or Demel, offer a taste of old-world Vienna and are a great place to relax and people-watch.
Vienna is considered one of Europe’s most beautiful and culturally rich cities for good reason. From its stunning architecture and world-class museums to its vibrant music scene and famous coffeehouses, there is no shortage of things to see and do in this historic city. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply someone who enjoys the finer things in life, Vienna is sure to captivate and inspire you. So why not plan a trip to this magical city and experience its wonder for yourself?

A week ago I was in Vienna, Austria for 48 hours. It was a short but meaningful trip.
The city is renowned for its “café culture.” A very particular collection of biases and instincts that shape the behaviors one can see.
The most iconic example of this particular collection is Café Central, a classical, old world café. Here’s an area near the front windows.
The café is famous, in part, because it was Adolf Hitler’s favorite when he lived in Vienna. Joseph Stalin’s too. In fact, for a time in 1913, Stalin, Hitler, Trotsky and Freud all lived within a kilometer of this meeting place.
Needless to say, the café is not a beacon of modernity.
The coffee was bitter and bland.
The service was (intentionally) bad. Half an hour before black coffee arrived.
The people were uniformly white and mostly old.
They were gossiping and gawking. Looking for and at those that didn’t fit the narrative of early 20th century Vienna.
On Monday, my 3pm flight allowed just enough time for one more Viennese café.
We went in a different direction this time. To a “third wave” coffee shop located near the University of Vienna called Coffee Pirates.
It couldn’t have been further from what we’d seen at Café Central.
The service was brisk and friendly.
The coffee was made slowly, to order, and with care.
The patrons were working, learning, building.
The presentation was thoughtful and generous.
From the moment we opened the door to the moment it closed behind us, were constantly invited to participate in the story that Coffee Pirates was telling about coffee. A story about community, about the way we connect.
Café Central was telling a very different story about coffee. One much more steeped in tradition for tradition’s sake. One about the premium of exclusion and the value of difference.
Café Central was a story about the ways things were.
Coffee Pirates is a story about the ways things will be.
I know where I want to spend my time.

Throwback To 2020: Life In Vienna During The Initial Days Of The COVID-19 Pandemic,https://palarkaprabha.medium.com/throwback-to-2020-life-in-vienna-during-the-initial-days-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-a2dfe7fdd017,"Sign up

Read the Bangla version of this article that was published on Unish Kuri.
It was a reasonably chilly February afternoon when I first caught the attention of the sudden rise of COVID 19 cases in Europe as I made my way back home from a fine art event in one of the quintessential Viennese red and white trams. Most of these cases were overwhelmingly being reported from Italy and Spain. Like any other layperson, my initial reactions were a concoction of wishful reasoning, indifference, slight concern, and ignorance. I continued to plan and work on all the assignments and deadlines I had for the upcoming spring and summer months. My attitude was hinging towards being carefree and believing that the virus was “just another flu” with probably slightly more severe symptoms.
However, within a matter of one week, as the number of infected people and the death toll began to rise just across the border in Italy, I finally grasped the reality of the situation and realized that it was just a matter of days before Vienna and other neighboring cities in Central Europe faced the same crisis. By the beginning of the second week of March, Austria started recording many new cases of infection daily, and I had to cancel all my plans for the upcoming months immediately without second thoughts. I started educating myself rigorously on this coronavirus to avoid unwanted panic through misinformation and fake news and arm myself to the teeth in case of the worst. Living halfway across the globe from my family in Kharagpur, it was pretty challenging to fathom and accept this unprecedented crisis and the sweeping changes it would bring in the future, both at a personal and community level.
Austria decided to go into a complete lockdown on 16th March, as the healthcare systems in Italy and Spain were put to the test for the first time since the Second World War. The number of infections rapidly rose across the European Union, prompting the WHO to declare Europe the pandemic’s epicenter. For the first time in my life, I felt completely exposed to a severe crisis, a feeling which I had only imagined partially or grasped by reading newspaper articles on wars and calamities. There was a great hustle on the days leading up to the lockdown in Vienna, with people hoarding food, medical, and other essential supplies like toilet paper and sanitizers. I, too, had to rush to multiple stores and secure basic supplies as not enough guidelines were available in English in the initial days. There was an eerie feeling that it was the silence before the storm- an impending natural disaster or war-like aggression. The government was swift to tackle this problem within a matter of days by ensuring smooth and unhindered supplies and providing detailed information in English to the expatriate community on their official website.
The quarantine days have been very stressful for me like billions of others around the globe, worrying about the human cost of this pandemic, possible shapes and forms of the job market for young graduates like myself, and their long-term psychological impact. Amidst all this negativity, the only silver lining from my quarantine has been the rediscovery of latent interests I have had, ranging from cooking various meals to experimenting with various forms of sketching. I humbly acknowledge my privilege to be able to indulge in these activities. An interesting observation arising out of being locked in the same apartment building for weeks together in this period has been the growing sense of belonging to this city and my neighborhood, which I never felt before as a foreign student. It is a life-long bond that I will carry into my old age.
The strict lockdown measures were relaxed earlier this week, and further restrictions would be lifted by the end of April. Being the first country in Europe to flatten the curve, the authorities in Austria aim to put the country back into much-needed economic normalcy by the middle of May. It seems for the moment that the initial cannonball has been dodged as deafening silence and apocalyptic scenes of deserted streets continue to loom large over the breakfast servings of apple tarts and melange coffee in Vienna. If the current levels of precautions and alertness are not maintained, the virus might regain strength again and cause another wave of casualties. The historian in me hopes that the city will overcome this dark chapter like it repeatedly did in the past in the events of the Mongol threats, the Ottoman sieges, the Spanish Flu pandemic, and the horrors leading up to and during the Second World War. And I cannot help but wonder how in these days of fighting the coronavirus, Mozart would have composed a string quartet, Klimt would have painted, and Freud would have psychoanalyzed his patients

A city that reminds me
Of a town,
Vienna,
The one with cool winds
And cooler heads.
On a Sunday,
Everyone gets a break,
The city shuts down,
As if on a curfew.
No shoppers or eaters
Roaming on the streets,
All establishments shut
And everyone stays home.
For an outsider
Vienna seems forlorn,
Like their city did during the lockdown.
But for insiders,
It is a paradise
As they enjoy time with family
At home.
Even on a Monday,
There is no hurry,
No running behind a bus or a train
No speed walking down the pathways.
Those going to the office or school,
Stroll at their pace,
Enjoying the winds
And the sun,
And their coffee in breaks.
They work at their pace
Enjoying the task at hand,
Undisturbed by the distractions,
As if in a mystic flow.
They cycle, calm and slow,
Not in a hurry to reach their destination
For them, the journey
Seems to be their destination.
Not formal wear,
No big cars or big frills
Just them in their shorts and ts
Going about their day
Like it’s a treat.
Living their lives
In a pause,
They teach me
How to take a break,
And learn how to walk slow,
To enjoy every moment,
Whether on vacation,
Or at work.
They teach me
To lessen my agendas
To leave behind the past
And let the future rest
To be in the present,
In this here and now.
I learn to sit still,
Immerse myself in the now,
Enjoy my surroundings,
And the words I read;
Stopping for a coffee
Every now and then.

Like Atlas, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, wait staff in Vienna take their job very, very seriously.
Vienna: the capital of Austria, home of the Hasburg dynasty, old architecture and tardy, poker faced, sarcastic wait staff.
In one of Europe’s oldest cities, with a long and rich cultural history, and a reputation as one of the world’s centres of art and learning, the wait staff rule supreme. Long waits for service, being ignored and a general attitude of low level irritation that you want to be a customer seems to be the norm.
Ancient architecture = posh attitude
One travel brochure (The Free Map For Young and Clever People) proclaims that in Vienna, “The waiter is king. Don’t be surprised if the waiters are unfriendly - not the guest is king, he is. Treat him as your superior and he will reward you.” The brochure also claims that “waiters NEVER smile” and that for tipping “5-10% of the bill is the amount the king expects from his subjects.”
The advice in The Free Map for Young And Clever People is ridiculously honest and self-deprecating.
To begin with you are annoyed and maybe offended by this behaviour. But, after a few experiences you realise that it’s not actually you personally the waiter hates, it’s everybody – perhaps it’s a persona they all adopt as part of their profession or as a survival tactic against drunk and obnoxious tourists who don’t speak German.
My personal experiences of this phenomenon were being told I had ordered children’s beer when choosing a 330ml sized glass (normal serving size in my country) instead of a ½ litre. My bad. Another was overhearing the same waiter yell at a patron asking them if they wanted to see a menu. Theoretically, this sounds like he was being helpful and doing his job. However, in person, his tone, body language and glare revealed the true nature of his passive aggressive overture. What he actually said nonverbally was “buy something to eat or f**K off”.
When your office is this plush you might be forgiven for developing an arrogant attitude.
A further experience was when buying a Kaserkrainer (vienesse hotdog) from a street vendor in the early hours of the morning. The vendor must have been earning significantly less than the barman and really needed the customers, but felt the need to finish his entire cigarette before deining to serve us. He then spent less time than it took to smoke it heating a sausage on the grill, before wrapping it and throwing it on the counter for me to collect. The patience we were expected to show while waiting was not reciprocal. While we fumbled uncoordinated and inebriated for the correct change, his bloodshot eyes glared with annoyance. How dare we bother him to prepare his advertised victuals and deign to give him a few euros for his disgruntled efforts.
This attitude is strange considering that you want to spend your money at the establishment where said wait staff are employed. You might think they would be welcoming of a tourist who wants to donate them money. You may highlight the link between your custom and their wages – but you would be wrong. The waiter just has no f**ks to give about you and your desires to eat or drink or be treated like a human being.
“Let them eat cake” - Marie Antionette was a Hasburg and probably developed the attitude that cost her life while growing up in Vienna.
Sometimes this apathy worked in our favour. For example, when the bus driver was in danger of having to do something untoward, such as turn in his seat, converse with you and maybe issue you a ticket. Instead, it was easier for him to just lift his eyes, wave his hand dismissively towards the general direction of the back of the bus and grunt something. We interpreted this as there would be no charge, but it may have meant - “I just don’t give a s**t.” I doubt he would have come to our defence if an undercover ticket check had taken place.
Advice for ‘Acting like a local' — “Be Grumpy”
The Free Map for Young and Clever People makes an effort to explain why the Viennesse hate on life. Under the heading ‘Act like a Local’ it was suggested that you “be grumpy”. Supposedly, it is “mandatory” for “original Vienesse to complain if the bus is one minute late or the weather is too hot/cold/wet/sunny. This “mentality” (general bad attitude) was justified as being part of the rich Vienesse culture and is based on hundreds of years of historical precedent and practice.
Back in the day (16-18th Centuries), Vienna was the home of the Hasburg Dynasty and the centre of several empires. As such it was a center of commerce, education, construction etc, and developed a large bureaucracy which served the monarchy and employed half the population of the city. Everybody knows that a high standard of living, steady employment and job security suck, so it is understandable that these unlucky civil servants developed a negative attitude.
Members of the Hasburg dynasty pretty much ruled most of Europe in the 16th - 18th centuries
According to the Free Map for Young and Clever People this explains why wait staff, and more generally everyone (especially if they had an ancestor who worked for the government) has the historical right to be grumpy, rude or generally a dick.
Other historical facts from the Free Map include how after WWII “all the Nazis miraculously disappear and the population suffers a collective loss of memory as far as the last 7 years are concerned.”
This appeal to history is obviously a bullsh**t excuse to act like a jerk. More likely, people being people, they could not leave their work at work and the hierarchal structure of a feudal bureaucracy permeated into their attitudes and behaviour outside of their jobs. Add a mix of simian tribalism or pack behaviour and next thing everyone is looking down their noses at anyone else their social standing allows them to – and treating them accordingly.
What is mystifying is that in contemporary Vienna, a city where the Arts and Humanities are cultivated, this is a standard of behaviour that some aspire to. Or perhaps it’s as simple as:
“If you don’t like a person, it’s because they remind you of something you don’t like about yourself.” — Sigmund Freud, father of modern psychology and resident of Vienna, before being forced to fleeing prior to WWII.

A Captivating Train Journey Through Stunning Landscapes From Vienna to Munich,https://travelsimplygo.medium.com/a-captivating-train-journey-through-stunning-landscapes-from-vienna-to-munich-a50e60777015,"Sign up

I decided to ditch the flight mode this time and chose to travel by train for the remainder of my Europe tour. This was the last leg of my 20-day Europe trip, and I had booked train tickets from Vienna to Munich in advance. Yes, it was a great decision.
I had traveled by train in Europe before on several other trips and the experience was stupendous. Notable among them -
Paris to Interlaken in Switzerland
Within Switzerland most of the travel I undertook by train
London to Edinburgh
Rome to Venice
Each form of transport has its advantages and disadvantages. Having different types of travel experiences is worthwhile and we must try them all. It is Fun !!
While trains have a charm of their own, one of the drawbacks is that you have to take care of your luggage and stack them in their proper place. Unlike a flight where your luggage is checked in and taken care of soon after you arrive, making you feel relaxed and free.
On the other hand, to catch a flight, you have to reach the airport at least two hours in advance and go through security, etc, while traveling by train does not involve any of these processes. Hence it is hassle-free and time-saving.
An additional reward of train travel is that you get to enjoy the bewitching countryside views.
Another benefit of train travel is that it is cheaper compared to flights.
Staying in the Ibis hotel directly opposite the railway station in Vienna was so convenient. Firstly, it was a great place to have your meals at the elaborate food court inside the station building. Similar to what we have at malls or airports, you could choose from a wide variety of cuisines.
Secondly, boarding my train to Munich was a breeze. All I had to do was cross the street and within minutes I was at the train station. Though I had the tickets downloaded on my phone, due to unfamiliar language, the platform and the seat numbers were not clear. As such a day prior to my departure, I went and clarified at the information kiosk. The result was that on the travel day everything was smooth sailing.
The railways have done a fantastic job of making train travel incredibly easy and comfortable. I really appreciate the presence of glass waiting lounges (similar to the one at Vienna) at railway stations — a protection for passengers against harsh weather conditions.
Absorbing the last glimpse of the splendors of Vienna, as the train left the platform, the view from the window transformed into staggeringly pretty vistas. The four-and-a-half-hour journey was filled with picture postcard scenery as the high-speed train traversed through verdant countryside landscapes, charming villages, with their cute cottages and historical landmarks.
Amongst the several stoppages en route was the historic town of Salzburg. It was on my bucket list, but was unable to visit. I was quite tempted to get down there and explore, but since there wasn’t any plan or reservations done, so skipped.
In the previous train journeys food was included, and I enjoyed the luxury of being served warm, delicious food and drinks in the cozy comforts of high-speed trains. The in-between snacks were a surprise perk and a great pass time.
This time though the pantry car and availability of food was a let down. Most of the hot, fresh food and beverages were over. There were very limited options left, that too of packaged snacks, that I don’t prefer.
I was craving for a hot chocolate drink and that was over. Something that I relish immensely, not just for its creamy, lip-smacking taste but also the fact that it aided in keeping me warm from the cold weather. Had to settle for the insipid, tasteless tea instead!
It didn’t even seem as if I was traveling from one country to another in Europe, except on crossing the border from Austria to Germany, when uniformed border police personnel were there inside the train for passport checking. I didn’t know about it, luckily had my passports in my handbag and not packed in the suitcase.
From the numerous connecting flights that I took, this was a different experience. A desirable change, rather than flitting in and out of airports. Holidaying at a slow, relaxed pace, that lifted my spirits.

From Pittsburgh to Vienna: How A Steelers’ Fan Became Co-Owner of the Vienna Vikings,https://joelnagel.medium.com/steelers-fan-becomes-owner-vienna-vikings-c0a2b446d973,"Sign up

Football has always been more than a pastime for me. I grew up just outside of Pittsburgh in the 1970s — a golden era for football, especially for Steelers’ fans. Between 1974 and 1979, the Steelers won four Super Bowls — what a time to be part of the Steeler Nation! And for a child coming of age in Western Pennsylvania, football wasn’t just a sport — it was part of my DNA.
As I grew into adulthood and my job took me all over the world, I never gave up on the Pittsburgh Steelers — to this day, I remain a devoted fan with season tickets. Of course, today, I live in Vienna, Austria, and don’t often make it to Pittsburgh, but my children go to games, and I join them whenever I can. Fortunately, I found another way to get my daily football fix: the Vienna Vikings.
When I was presented with the opportunity to become co-owner (and lawyer) of the Vienna Vikings, one of Europe’s most outstanding American football teams, I didn’t think twice. While soccer is unquestionably the most popular sport in Europe, the idea of promoting American football in Vienna appealed to me on several levels.
On a personal level, I’m a huge football fan, no matter what continent it’s being played on. And to have the opportunity to move from fan, aka spectator, to actually being involved in the day-to-day decisions and management of a team — it’s something of a dream come true. Over the years, I even built close friendships with players like the late Franco Harris, a Pittsburgh legend, and we worked on a few business projects together.
On a professional level, the investment potential is enormous, not unlike a burgeoning startup. While the Vienna Vikings are an established team with a long and proud tradition in Austria, they hadn’t yet made an impact at the international level when I joined. The Vikings had been a national amateur powerhouse and only recently joined the international European League of Football (ELF), a professional European league. I felt this was a prime moment to join the team and help it expand from the somewhat limiting national level into an international high-flier.
Of course, as with any startup, there are challenges and questions along the way. How will the Vikings compete on an international level? How will we get the best players? Will fans remain loyal to the team in the new league?All of these questions, I understood, could be addressed with strategy, forward planning, and strong leadership. And as a lawyer and a lifelong football fan, I felt I had something to contribute.
Austria has an impressive football development system, with nearly 1,000 players at the high school level working their way up from amateur leagues to the professional level. This offers a vast pool of local talent when it comes time for the draft.
ELF rules stipulate that teams can only draft four American players — this rule keeps the playing field fair (pun intended) and prevents an unsustainable “arms race” for foreign stars, which is what doomed previous European football leagues.
Unlike some teams in ELF who rely heavily on their American players, who often bring to the table NFL-caliber talent, the Vienna Vikings rely on a mix of local, European, and American talent.
That combination matters. Last season, for example, we were playing in Poland — behind all game, without our starting quarterback. Even our backup got injured mid-game. That’s when our third-string QB, a 40-year-old who hadn’t played professionally in years, stepped up. Against all odds, he led the final drive and won the game in the last 30 seconds. That’s the kind of resilience and depth we’re building.
American football in Europe is still catching up to the NFL — there’s no denying that. But that’s also what makes this journey exciting. There’s an authenticity here, a real desire to achieve the highest possible level of professionalism.
Unlike soccer, which often skews male and rowdy in its European fan base, American football here is a family affair. You’ll see parents and kids enjoying the game together — a dynamic that’s helped the sport grow across different audiences. The fact that English is the sport’s official language also broadens the audience to include diverse people from different backgrounds.
I’m optimistic about the future of American football in Europe, both as a fan and as an investor. Last year, millions of people showed up and tuned in to watch the European championship game, the Eurobowl. The Vienna Vikings reached the final, though we came up just short. But the growing international audience is undeniable.
The Vienna Vikings, in particular, have a wide and expanding fan base that extends beyond Austria. Vienna’s historical role as a cultural capital draws in fans from Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and beyond — making the Vikings more than just Austria’s team.
We’re in discussions with several NFL teams about building strategic partnerships. The idea of an eventual NFL Europe division featuring cities like London, Frankfurt, and hopefully Vienna is no longer a pipe dream. It makes strategic sense for the league, and we believe Vienna is in a “sweet spot” to be a part of that future.
Personally, I believe football remains a source of joy. I love the sport, enjoy it with my children whenever possible, and am fully invested in the Vikings’ growth and expansion.
Yes, there’s still work to do. The NFL has set certain standards, and Europe needs to catch up. But the trajectory is clear. The enthusiasm is real. And the foundation we are building is solid.
And I’m proud to be part of it.

Vienna is well known for its high proportion of social housing. Nowadays most sources seem to estimate that around 25% of people living in the city live in some form of municipal housing. It’s evident as you walk around the city. You cannot walk along a street without coming across a housing block with the very recognisable sign outside the entrance. And with the city celebrating it’s 100th year since the first ‘Gemeindebau’ it’s also inescapable in every exhibition about the city’s history.
Housing is an essential component of any city. And with my background working at one of London’s largest housing design practices, I might be biased, but I didn’t think I could come to Vienna to understand how they are approaching gender equitable design without understanding how the city’s housing works.
The existing centre of Vienna is dense, typically made up of courtyard block typologies. So there are limited opportunities for new housing development. The city has a fairly rigid zoning style ‘building code’, which not only sets out built parameters for building lines at the front and back, as well as heights, but also sets out what land uses are allowed on a block by block basis. This has meant that an increasingly popular form of development in the centre is rooftop extensions, as in most areas only a single storey can be added.
In the centre the majority of housing is comprised of flats. It’s not until you get quite far out that you start encountering detached homes. In the older part of town the flats often have unique layouts as they do away with the traditional arrangement of rooms coming off of a hallway, and instead the rooms themselves act as circulation space. This leads to quite space efficient apartments, even if there are some quirks — such as entering the kitchen through the bathroom! Often this comes about through separate apartments having been combined together to create a more spacious home. This also leads to difficulties with living rooms being above bedrooms and vice versa. The other thing that’s worth noting is that many apartments in Vienna in the old town do not have balconies. But as the flats have tall and lofty rooms you don’t miss this so much.
In Red Vienna the city was really reconceptualising how to design for how people wanted to live. The aim was to provide affordable homes of good quality for broad sectors of the population. The housing provided people with light, fresh air and sunshine, as well as nurseries, schools, lending libraries and other communal facilities like laundry rooms. And with more free time they had to organise their lives differently, and the architecture followed suit too — with more space allowed for leisure too. The kitchen became a different kind of space — often with other functions combined with this space, turning it from a purely functional space to one to dwell in. The focus on the evolving role of the kitchen in the home, at the time, ensured that the needs of all genders were taken into consideration and advanced and adapted to new social norms.
Whilst the social principles from which Red Vienna emerged are not necessarily explicitly evident as you walk around the city, many of the ideals still undoubtedly influence and inform the shape of the city and its housing that you see today. And the legacy of the city’s municipal housing undoubtedly has an influence on the shape of its future housing.
Earlier this year I was awarded the RTPI George Pepler Award by the RTPI. The George Pepler Award is a bursary granted to a person in their first 10 years post qualification experience wishing to undertake a short period of study on a particular aspect of spatial planning. I was delighted to win the opportunity to carry out my research proposal entitled ‘What can the UK learn from Vienna with regards to adopting a gender mainstreaming approach to shape built outcomes?’ I am currently in Vienna for researching how Vienna has made itself more Gender Equal. #GenderEqualCities

My first touch with Vienna was in April during my first tour of Europe. The idea was to support the launch of my book about webpack and see some new places. I never intended the trip to lead to a cascade that would change my life, but that’s what ended up happening.
Perhaps the biggest reason for that was the fact that I made new friends and began to see myself in a different light. I have an introverted past, and I fit the stereotype of a nerd well. The first trip began a still ongoing change that’s rewriting me as a person.
I encountered Vienna by chance. I was given an option to give a presentation at React Vienna to conclude the tour. As a curious person, I decided to take the chance. I felt welcomed by the community instantly, and I felt comfortable during the two-hour session.
As I happened to have some free time in Vienna, I explored the city. I’ve learned that one way to get to know the local people is to go to meetups. Even though I am/was an introvert, my curious side tends to win over my natural shyness.
It’s in one of these meetups where I met someone who I consider a true friend now. We connected on an intellectual level and this grew into a deep, personal friendship. The fact that we met is mostly due to chance, but sometimes you have to get lucky to change the direction of your life.
It’s this relationship and the local community that has dragged me to Vienna over and over again. It’s a gift that keeps giving. I keep refining myself and the way I think through the constant interactions I have with the city and its residents.
I believe to get to know a city, you have to spend a long time in it. I decided to try with Vienna as I wanted to see if it’s as good city for me as it felt like the first times I saw it.
You can see that Vienna was a capital of an empire once. It combines high culture with a high-quality of living. It’s a city where you never get bored as there’s always something to do. Most importantly, nature is near.
Not everything is perfect, but it feels like an excellent compromise for me as I could have a lifestyle fitting me here while maintaining valuable personal connections.
The idea behind spending a Summer month in Vienna was simple: recharge batteries, build contacts, develop business, prepare for September presentations at ReactNext and WebExpo. I didn’t intend to change as a person much, but that happened more as a side effect.
This year has made me realize that I have lived a sheltered albeit safe life. But is that a good way to live? I’m in the best condition of my life in many ways. Excellent health and certain skills allowed me to grow myself a decent business and generate a lot of opportunities, but I always felt perhaps something is missing.
It’s easy to live your life in a bubble as you follow a certain routine without questioning. Technically that works, and it worked for me, but what if there is more to life than that? This is the question I began to ask myself more and more, and it feels like Vienna allowed me to find some answers while giving new questions.
You could say I haven’t felt much since the primary school. You shed your last pieces of emotion while you go through the army indoctrination mandatory to Finnish men. The stereotype of a man is not to show emotion in public unless it’s related to sports. Perhaps it’s not so good stereotype after all.
Strangely enough spending time in Vienna began to make me feel more alive than before. As I saw more and more people, I started to get out of my shell. I am still reserved but far less so and I actually enjoy my life instead of settling for what I have. It’s simply amazing I get to do something I like while getting paid well enough to sustain my lifestyle.
I even began to meet people of my opposite sex only to realize that’s the world I know embarrassingly little about. Doing this has given me life lessons that will stick with me for a long while. You can read all the self-help books you want, but sometimes it’s real life that teaches you the most even if it might be painful at times and might force you to feel new emotions.
I still have a long way to go on this road of discovery. I feel as if I was unchained. For me to achieve this, I had to lose my old environment and go far beyond my comfort zone. It’s a path I chose, and I have no idea where it leads, but I am happy to have chosen it.
I find it interesting that starting to do something humble like writing a book to help other people transformed my entire life. First I grew a small business only to realize there’s more to life. And now I’m living the next stage in which I’m discovering what that more is.
During this stage, I will hopefully learn to balance personal side with business as in personal business these two are interrelated. There is no one without another as I’ve come to understand.
I feel as if I gained years worth of life experience by spending a month in Vienna and by being curious enough. I am more aware than ever that I have to grow and develop personally. Perhaps this was the reboot I needed for future success in both business and on a personal level.
For me the conclusion is clear. There’s life beyond computers and business.

The background to my being in Austria in the first place: family. My parents were immigrants to the United States where I was born and grew up. They returned to their home country at some point, which I wasn’t happy about. Long story short: My relationship with this city is ambivalent. I hated it when we first arrived from sunny southern California. It was a completely different world. Over the years, things have changed and a certain cool factor exists plus I love classical music so it’s not the worst place to be spending time.
Here are some cool and weird facts about Vienna along with some of my experiences. Some apply to Austria. Other odd factoids are typically Viennese you won’t find anywhere else.

Tuesday and Wednesday, May 6 and 7
This may be a long post because it covers two days. We are greeted by the Empress Maria Theresa, one of the rare female monarchs we have encountered. The Viennese speak warmly of her and I believe she had a long and peaceful reign. She also had 16 (!) children, one being Marie Antoinette. They were all intermarried, it seems.
There is another monarch, Empress Elizabeth, whose life was much more complicated, but more about her later.
To be honest, I have taken so many pictures of so many buildings that I can’t remember three days later which is which. I just want to give you a sense of each place. All of the cities started with the Celts, then Vikings, then the Roman Empire. Only rare bits of Roman roads and buildings can be seen.
The streets are narrow and curved in the medieval style. The buildings are from later periods. Many have been rebuilt because of WW II.
In Germany the Renaissance style buildings were over the top, like Baroque and Rococo. But Vienna is a little more subdued. It is spacious and grand and elegant without overwhelm.
So here are a few pictures of various buildings and statues. The only thing I can discern is when I’m taking pictures of a church.
This is not a church. This is the old city gate and its alcove, home to the Sisi Museum and the Lippizaner Museum ( the famous dancing white horses).
Speaking of horses, they have horse drawn carriages you can ride? But we didn’t do this.
What was cool was that the horses all had these decorative head pieces that covered their ears. I guess it gets cold in Vienna in the winter.
This is the Imperial Palace in Vienna, which has a ridiculous number of rooms.
This is some statue monarch made to associate himself with God. I’m not sure if was to honor God or himself, but there was that “divine right of kings” thing going centuries ago. And then you remember all the Prince Bishops… so much intertwining of religious and political power.
I was surprised that a truck drove through a pedestrian area! I didn’t expect that.
Street food.
Now this really surprised me. Here is this beautiful building covered with an advertisement. I looked closed and this is actually a fabric painting reproducing the building; it hides the scaffolding and the ad helps disguise the fabric covering. You don’t even notice it’s fake. A disguise of a disguise.
This is a church. I think it’s St. Stephen’s.
Note the beautiful tiled roof.
It’s always hard to get a picture of the whole church but I got this replica.
Pictures of inside the church follow.
And there is always a gift shop.
After the official tour we decided to go wander around Vienna. Chocolate, anyone? ( I’m talking to you, Abby.) They gave samples, like at an ice cream store.
This made us hungry so we stopped in a coffee shop and of course you need a pastry to go along with your coffee. Even Chappell drank coffee in honor of the tradition.
Interesting sights along the way. Bicycles often have a large front container to carry groceries or to ferry children. If they ferry children they have little car seats with seat belts.
Poor dog!
(Rachel I know. I don’t have many dogs here but not as many people have dogs and they don’t let you pet them.)
Chappell asked me what I wanted to do next. I wanted to go to the Sisi Museum. I’m sure Jeremy knows all about this because he knows about everything. I had never heard of her but she had a tragic life. I am told it is now a Netflix series called “Princess Elizabeth.”
When you go into the museum the first thing you see a is a plaster death mask. She was quite poetic and expressed her melancholy in her journals. They were posted on the walls throughout.
“But mournfully I spread my wide, white wings, return home to the fairy kingdom and nothing shall bring me back again.”
“I am Sunday’s child, a child of the sun. Her golden rays she wove into my throne; with her glow she wove her crown. It is her light that I live, but should she ever wane from me, I must die.”
Sisi grew up in Bavaria out in the countryside. It was an idyllic childhood. She is the little girl in each of these pictures.
This is a bust of her at age 10. She grew into a beautiful young woman who was known for her beautiful hair.
These were some of her Crown Jewels.
And some of her ball gowns.
Her fan
These were her staterooms.
And her personal exercise room.
And her bedroom
Sisi lived a very sad life. She hated the constraints of the court and its duties, but her real torture was her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law was terribly overbearing and ruled with an iron fist.
Even so, the couple was reasonably happy. Sisi was away on a state visit with her husband when their child died at age 6. That caused a rift in their marriage that was never repaired. Sisi began traveling throughout Europe without her husband; she seemed to have given up on her son and left him behind to the “care” of his mother-in-law. (Sisi’s son Rudolph was a disaster, probably as a result of his horrible upbringing.) Sisi, herself, wore black during these sad, later years.
“Elizabeth’s incessant traveling is increasingly characterized by unease and restlessness. The “lady in black” constantly sought to escape the burden of her own personality and was prey to profound melancholy.”
At age 61 she was assassinated by an anarchist who just wanted to create some chaos. She was never meant to be the target, but she was at the wrong place at the wrong time. What a tragic life.
The next day we woke up with a boat gas station and attendant right outside our balcony. I had never thought about the need to fuel up or how they would do that. I’d love to know more about all the behind the scenes workings of the ship.
Chappell had gone to the Schonnbrun Palace (the summer residence), so I had the morning to myself. I had been thinking about going to the Klint Museum but couldn’t get an appointment that didn’t conflict with a planned afternoon tour of the Vienna Boys Choir. So I just spent a sunny morning in the lounge. (This is also where I caught up on my posts.)
This was the view of modern Vienna on the opposite bank from the old city. It’s all very new and modern.
That afternoon I took a trip to the home of the Vienna Boys choir, but it’s more than one choir of boys.
It functions as a boarding school set in a beautiful old neighborhood in Vienna.
These are the formal gardens.
Everything is “old Vienna.”
The choir has been in existence since before 1500 and was always supported by the royalty. During these centuries the boys were dressed as little soldiers in the king’s army. After the fall of the monarchy the uniforms were changed to sailor suits. This was not because they had a navy but because sailor suits were normal attire for children at that time.
We were escorted into an oval room with perfect acoustics and serenaded by 18 boys in the choir.
Of course the music was angelic. Their voices were were so pure and clear. I think I will never forget the sound of their voices.
I had hoped for that but I learned things I never expected.
They started the performance with “There’s no business like show business” which was quite a surprise. They sang a wide range of music as a group, with occasional solos and duets.
The children are from all over the world and tour all over the world. It was touching to see a Russian boy and a Ukrainian boys singing side by side. It was perhaps appropriate because their last song was “We are the world, we are the children.” They consider themselves as ambassadors.
They are more than a boys choir. There is a non-residential elementary school for children ages 6–10, with quite an emphasis on music. If the children show an interest and aptitude, there are simple auditions for admission to the residential middle school and choir for ages 10–14.
There are actually four choirs of about 24 boys each. Each choir is named after a great composer, such as the Brahms choir, the Mozart choir, etc. One choir is always on tour while the other choirs have school. There is also a girls’ choir for ages 10–14 with their own conductor. The girls attend the school but go home at night; a dormitory for them is being planned. Their is now a high school, so the children can continue their education and be part of the youth choir. Some stay, but others opt for a normal high school life (if such a thing exists).
It’s good to know, though, that they have a normal life. I got this photo of some of the boys were playing soccer. They still get to be kids.

Despite its size, Austria’s capital has the feel of a large town. According to global rankings, Vienna is one of the most livable cities in the world. Because of excellent public services, economic success, and low crime rates. At the time of writing, Vienna had been named the world’s unfriendliest city. Don’t you think it’s a bit contentious?
Here are some useful hints and details about Vienna, Austria, as well as driving directions. We can say that getting around Vienna is a breeze.
The city is divided into 23 districts. A neighborhood that surrounds the “Ringstraße” — Ring street.
By simply walking down this street, you can see many sights in Vienna.In the past, fortifications guarding the city stood where Ringstraße now stands.
Austrians frequently refer to districts by their numbers. “I live in the first!” or “I have to travel to the tenth tomorrow!” you might hear. Isn’t that not at all Germans?
You can tell which district you are in by looking at the number on the street name sign.

For the first time in a long time,
I feel like myself again.
Not the version I had to shrink to be loved,
not the one who stayed quiet to keep the peace,
not the girl who called the bare minimum “enough.”
She walked through hell,
but I left her there —
with the people who fed off her silence
and mistook her kindness for weakness.
Now, I’m done explaining,
done waiting to be chosen,
done carrying weight that was never mine.
I’ve never felt so *light.*
There’s sunlight in my bones again,
a laugh I don’t have to fake,
and dreams I’m finally letting breathe.
Next week: Florida.
Me and my friends, chasing the sun,
singing too loud, dancing barefoot,
and soaking in every golden hour like it’s a promise.
Then — Europe.
A one-way ticket and no return date.
No plan but joy.
No map but instinct.
I want to get lost on purpose.
To fall in love with places, moments, and maybe even myself again.
To write my story across coastlines and cafés,
with no one’s voice in my head but mine.
This summer isn’t an escape —
it’s a return.
To who I was before the noise.
To who I’ve *always* been, underneath the wreckage.
And this time,
I’m not just moving on —
I’m moving *up.*
Unapologetically.
Unstoppably.
Unforgettably.
With love (and finally, freedom),
**Me**

Vienna, Austria’s main city, calls out to those wanting to travel, really showing off a sweet mix of old-time class and super current appeal. As you map out what you might do in 2025, check out what makes Vienna a spot you should make time for.
One solid reason why peeps head to Vienna, very, is because of its old buildings and totally awesome design work. From the flashy Schönbrunn Palace to the grand St. Stephen’s Cathedral with its super old style, Vienna’s loaded with famous spots showing off its super rich past. Each spot there, kind of tells stories from when the city had kings and queens, providing like, a little look into royal stories.
link: Scope out what Vienna’s made of with places on tours!
Vienna acts as a big spot for what’s hip, playing host to worldwide museums and places for checking out cool art. The Kunsthistorisches Museum with the Albertina Museum bring master art into the frame, and the MuseumsQuartier provides modern pieces, too it’s almost, all different walks of creative styles that can get a gaze out of Vienna.
link: Witness Vienna’s dope artistry on superb gallery hopping excursions!
Past, its charming things from times of yore, that stuns people getting around to nice areas with plant life included such as parks and yards to sit in Vienna. That location made out to hold, just a short trip, and get people walking there or doing picnics like the Schönbrunn Palace Gardens or Stadtpark are kind of there.
link: Tour open field getaways in Vienna on foot!
Food wise, it gives all people a taste which provides variety such as traditional eats meets modern, since there’s super yummy places for treats; such as drinks plus fancier restaurant place options where each mouthful has stories in Vienna.
link: Taste foods cooked in tours that focus mainly just around chow in Vienna!
Vienna’s yearly stuff gives all types plus times available that’s quite like music events and showing opera which, very, brings like magical audio feel throughout iconic venue zones so check the beats or how people display traditions there as a option to do that might seem very entertaining during your vacation
link: Jam at music events out playing while you come travel over toward Vienna!
That city greets everyone really nice but provides current zones while exploring to go inside which help feel special such as hotels which look cool when peeking high over streets down beneath all luxury types providing special districts from before. Vienna tries hard at trying its best Austrian feel since they know modern needs seem key plus a vacation needs memorable service for visits to local territory, too it’s almost, each tourist wants this place at some parts throughout whenever being close from them as places around Vienna have lots, and loads, to tell too!
link: Come across those high scores by other folk where lodging happens inside!
The blending mix throughout that zone means you visit history, culture that feel fairly home-y or super out of this ordinary during adventures!
There are tons like safety type precautions set cause most see not that high dangers as they get vacation feel in locations.
Early in warmth (say start near Apr thru towards almost June), that gives mild breeze over those periods if avoid large mass cause tourist traffic, while that nice feels could occur anytime during each moment when season turns later round later times within twelve moths overall .
link: Craft ideas for that perfect escape for what’s from Vienna using information around others holidays planned there already!!

…Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role…
We had the pleasure of interviewing Martina Huemann. Martina is Professor at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business where she heads the Project Management Group in the Department Strategy and Innovation and is the Academic Director of the Professional MBA Program: Project Management. She has published widely in the fields of Project Management and Human Resource Management. For her Research on Human Resource management in Project-oriented Organisations, she received the IPMA Research Award 2015.
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path?
Born in Vienna, Austria I am currently living between Vienna and London. While in Vienna I am Academic Director of the Vienna Executive MBA: Strategic Project Management and lead the Project Management Group in the Institute of Strategic Management at WU Vienna. For 1,5 years I am a Full Professor of Project Leadership and Society at University College London, Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction.
I am Editor-in Chief of International Journal of Project Management, the leading journal in Project Research and Founding Editor-in-Chief of Project Leadership and Society and hold several board positions in national and international Associations.
I have two children, two boys, one born 1997 and one born 2005.
Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
My career was probably not expected from me. As I was the first one in my family who made it to university. My parents came from a simple background, my mother was educated as a tailor but run a small shop and my father was a warehouse worker for a newspaper. While both not having much formal education, they always gave me the feeling that I can achieve everything what I want.
I also did my studies at WU Vienna and when I entered the building I felt not belonging there, more an alien. I had no role models in my family. However, I decided that I wanted to get more knowledge and a formal education. I studied Business Administration. During the weekends Friday to Sunday night, I worked 20 hours plus in an ice cream shop to contribute to financing my life.
I always having a drive for learning, getting to know something new, but also for visiting other countries and traveling. I am a quite curious person interested in understanding different subjects and contexts, meeting new people and making a difference.
During my studies I spent one semester in Prague and later one semester in Lund Sweden. I was travelling and had the opportunity to engage in different projects, one of those was an EU funded project bringing Didactics to Middle and Eastern Europe countries like Poland, Tech Republic and Slovakia. I was engaged there as a student evaluator. Looking back this got me interested in universities, teachings and in projects and how change can be organised trough projects. Which set the ground also for my interest to research and educate how to manage projects.
When I finally finished my graduate studies, I got a position at a newly established small department at WU focused on Project Management. I supported the establishment of that university unit, its research and education programme. Finally, I received a position funded by the university and started my doctorate in Project Management. I early got involved internationally in the International Project Management Association as I was taken there through my professor. That helped me immensely to build my network.
My first son was born shortly after I received my first university financed position. This caused quite some turbulence. I was questioned by my work environment if family was now my priority and if leaving academia would be better for me. I took a quite short maternity leave and went back to keep my position and finished my doctorate.
My career was only possible with my partner and especially the of my mother and the father of my partner. who helped a lot with the childcare. To make a university career in my context I had to pursue a Habitation, and which set a further milestone in my career that opened the door for my professorship.
Can you share a pivotal moment in your career that significantly influenced your path to leadership?
As an early career researcher, I received a quite tempting invitation to apply for positions at another university abroad. But I decided not to go for it as I would have needed to take the whole family to a different country. It would have been very difficult for my partner to find a job and I felt it was not appropriate to ask my partner and my family to start somewhere new just because of my career aspirations.
This is also the reason why I did my career at WU Vienna. While it was international and I have been engaged in International Associations like International Project Management Association or Project Management Institute, I remained a stable main position at WU Vienna. However as my children are now grown up, I did apply for a professorship at University College London and reduced my position at WU.
Ok, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. According to this report, only about 31.7% of top executive positions across industries are held by women. This reflects great historical progress, but it also shows that more work still has to be done to empower women. In your opinion and experience what is currently holding back women from leadership and management?
Many different issues. Most of them are structural
Woman are socialized with a set of desired behaviours expected from them.
Can you share a few reasons why more women should become leaders and managers?
Women and men are different, and this is good. People are different in their personalities and talents and hey bring different perspective and contributions.
Studies show that women in board rooms make a positive effect on company performance. The offer is to see women (and other minorities) rather as an asset and help to build structures to support them to provide contributions.
Can you please share “5 Things We Need To Increase Women’s Engagement in Leadership and Management?” If you can, please share an example or story for each.
First, targeted mentoring and coaching are essential. Women often face barriers to accessing high-quality mentorship, so structured programs help women identify their strengths, set clear goals, and navigate leadership challenges. I remember when my employer once said, “Try it for six months. If it doesn’t work, you can go back.” That kind of mentoring gave me a safe space to test my leadership skills without the fear of permanent failure, which really helped me move forward in my career.
Proactive networking is another important factor. Women need to actively create or join networks that connect them with senior leaders and like-minded peers. These networks provide access to important contacts and sponsorship opportunities.
Flexible working arrangements are also crucial. The challenge of balancing professional and family responsibilities often deters women from pursuing leadership roles. By adopting flexible hours, job-sharing, or part-time management positions, leadership roles can be made more accessible. In my own experience, I’ve seen the positive effects of companies offering more flexibility. In one example, a company revamped its policies to allow flexible scheduling, which allowed a talented leader to balance her childcare responsibilities with her role on the board. The result was improved team performance.
Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role.
Finally, objective recruitment and promotion processes are critical. Using methods like structured personality assessments and behaviour-based interviews helps combat unconscious bias and ensures candidates are chosen based on merit.
In your opinion, what systemic changes are needed to facilitate more equitable access for women to leadership roles?
Companies must embrace legislation that promotes gender diversity, like the EU’s push for more women on boards. However, quotas alone aren’t enough — accountability is key to preventing tokenism.
Corporate cultures need to evolve to value leadership traits that women excel in, such as empathy and collaboration. Changing outdated success metrics to reflect these qualities is essential, and recruitment and promotion processes must also be free from bias, prioritising merit over personal connections.
Work-life integration policies should be standard, not exceptions. Companies must normalise flexible work options for everyone, not just working mothers. Investing in female leadership development early on through mentorship, training, and networks like the WU Executive Academy’s Female Leaders Network ensures women have the resources to succeed in senior roles.
These systemic changes won’t happen overnight, but when companies and policymakers commit to action rather than discussion, real progress follows.
What strategies have you found most effective in mentoring and supporting other women to pursue leadership positions?
My main strategy is to empower young women to find their own ways and learn to trust in themselves. I am mentoring several women to help them in their academic careers. Very operationally I help them to understand their strengths and especially help them to understand they are not required to deliver 110% all the time. A trap that I have tapped in during my career and which I could not continue especially after I had my children.
A funny story to share was at one of my first panels I was invited to. I prepared so much and worked on my performance in every detail. I just wanted to be able to provide the perfect answers to all possible questions. Which is of cause not possible. However, I did not stop preparing and did not sleep the night before the event. So, when I was sitting at the panel, I was very tired, very serious and concentrated to get it all right. Without any smile, quite fact oriented. I was knowledgeable, said the right things, but my message was not convincing. It was just one boring smart voice among many others. Additionally, when others were speaking, I was so tiered that I simply fell asleep in front of 300 people. My sleep only took some seconds, and I still hope nobody saw it. However, that situation taught me an important lesson which I use to encourage women not to over prepare, take life a little easier, consider the package, how to deliver the message and not only what.
And yes we women cannot have everything at the same time. Children and major career steps at the same time is (almost) not possible to pursue at the same time. But there is also the right time for everything. Not everything needs to happen till the age of 35.
A good personal example is my recent career step, the appointment as Professor at University College London. When I was invited to apply, my youngest child was to finish School thus it was a window of opportunity that had opened, but it is then also a decision if you want to get you out of your comfort zone.
How would you advise a woman leader about how to navigate the challenges of being a woman in a leadership role within a male-dominated industry?
When I did my first formal education in Project Management, it was in 1996 and it was the Certificate Programme “International Project Management”, back then offered by the WU Vienna and the Technical University Vienna. There were 20 participants in class, 19 men and me. All of them having technical background mainly Engineering, Construction and Information Technology, the typical industries in which Project Management was applied back then. My background was Business Administration (specialized in Marketing) and I was the only woman. I was again an obvious alien, especially as I was the only woman in the room, and I was young. In this situation I asked myself whether I fit in? But reframed my question in what I can bring to the table, what are my competencies my talents that I can contribute and makes me add value. In this situation it was my social competencies, my strength to observe, listen and ask questions, thus my talent to lead processes in groups that added value and allowed me to add value. This is also my advice to women, know what you are good at understand what added value you can bring to the table. Be authentic and play to your strengths.
How do you balance the demand for authoritative leadership with the stereotypical expectations of female behaviour in professional settings?
Well use stereotypes like the hard man and the soft woman because that makes live easier to us. But the world is not black and white. If we look in more detail I do not believe in authoritarian leadership. Hero leadership is not working, especially not with younger generations. Hierarchies have become flatter, people want to work flexible, self organised, autonomy has become important, that is reflected in a modern leadership that is flatter, shared, distributed and often puts purpose in the foreground.
A leader needs be reflective person who takes decisions timely and is accountable for them. Core competences are to navigate uncertainty, embrace change, give orientation to others, think strategically and engaging others to co-create the future of an organisation. Today leaders should be able to stand in the spotlight but also is able to share the spotlight with others.

I woke up this morning at dawn…I wasn’t quite sure where I was until I opened the window. The sun was rising in the horizon and it clicked: “Vienna!”
I had always dreamed of Vienna as this elegant and majestuous city, home of Sisi the Empress and fairy tales my mum used to read me in bed. I remember the history books in high school with pictures of the Austro-Hungarian Empire portraying royal families and castles. The heart of Europe.
I left my hotel not knowing exactly where I was headed to; all I wanted was to travel back in time, wander through history, let the city surprise me and instinct be my guide.
As I approached the centre, the magic started to unfold: majestic buildings like the Parliament, the Museum…I walked through a manicured garden that led me straight into the statue of Mozart. It reminded me that Vienna is The City Of Music, home to Beethoven and Schubert and I can understand where they got the inspiration to…

I wish I never met you.
I don't think there was any good reason behind it I think it was an accident.
Like, Fate got distracted looking at its phone, and when it looked back up, we’d crashed into each other, and it was too late.
The damage was done, and we had met.
I don't think it was a good lesson or that it had made me tougher or a better person I think it just became part of the reason I'm not the same anymore.
The reason I'm so closed off, the reason I don't trust people at all anymore.
I don't think we were supposed to meet.
I think it was a complete misfortune.
And sometimes I think about the day it happened and how one minor decision could have stopped the whole thing.
One moment could have saved me.
Because if we had never met, I would still be all the good parts of me, and there would be a few less parts that need to be fixed.
And I would still go for drives, but you wouldn't enter my thoughts like you were robbing a bank.
And I would still have these friends, but we would not reflect on how warped I was during the time you were a part of my life.
And I would still have fallen in love again, and it wouldn't have taken as much reassurance.
I wouldn't have been shocked that love is so different than I had originally thought.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, sure, but I'd be strong anyway, and the time I spent around you is dead to me, wasted time.
I wish I never met you.
I wish fate had been paying attention.
It was an accident that wasn't waiting to happen, a calamity, a catastrophe, a mistake.

I am just back from a two-day workshop in Vienna. I am intellectually energized, as these small-scale workshops are the most productive academic sessions. It was an official meeting of the EASA Media Anthropology Network. It was great to catch up with some of the members I already knew and meet new academics. You can find the workshop program here. The event was supported by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, which is located in a historical building: the PSK Building. I presented on Local Knowledge and the Cultural Contexts of AI, which I am pursuing as part of my intellectual and research agenda nowadays.
I have visited Vienna several times, so I wasn’t into sightseeing. The weather was fantastic, and walking around the city was beautiful. Still, I could “unsave” in my Google Maps to places in my Atlas Obscura list! Josephinum (Old-school medical museum with more than 1,000 wax anatomical models created in the 18th century) and Pathological-anatomical collection in the Narrenturm (wikipedia entry) (Striking former mental hospital from the 1700s, now home to exhibitions on anatomy, illness & death.).
No photos allowed above, but you can see some here.

We arrived at the Residence to discover a spectacularly landscaped backyard:
We’re grateful for having arrived in time to enjoy it in all its blooming glory.
The dogs arrived unfazed and adapted quickly. They appreciated the opportunity to be outside in the gorgeous weather. Rosie assumed her sentinel stance…
…while Nero demonstrated his uncanny ability to get comfortable anywhere and on any surface, as long as it’s near us:
We had an opportunity to wander the commercial district on Währinger Straße near the Residence — an unforgettable first impression of the Vienna neighborhood:
And a grim reminder that the reverberations from Dallas are felt around the world:

Loving you was easy, letting go is tough!
You’ll never hear me say, “I wish I had never met you,” although sometimes I feel that way.
You’re my every thought — both the reason I cry and the reason I smile.
I never thought I’d be so hurt over something that didn’t last all that long.
The pressure on my heart when I think of how our relationship got worse and not better! But out of everyone who could have hurt me, why did it have to be you?

Recently, I was on a river cruise through the Lower Danube on AmaWaterways with Christian (TellMeWhyTravel). The stops along the way included Budapest, Hungary, Bratislava, Slovakia, Durnstein, Salzburg, and Vienna, Austria. All of the cities are known for its historical importance from war, due to their strategic location on the river, to arts and culture, where some of the greatest minds which ever existed created. However, by the time you’ve gotten to this page, you already know about Mozart, the Hungarian Parliament, Buda Castle, and the other tourist attractions your tour guide will show you. As our tour guide YOLO (Yes! That’s his name!) said, “Do you see ABC? ABC, another bloody church, additional broken castle.” While I can respect the art and architecture, and the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the churches, castles, and monuments of the era, once I’ve seen one (or two) I’ve kind of seen them all. (There are definitely some cool churches and castles but that’s for a different story!)
I’m going to take you off the beaten path and show you some of the art and culture of today in these cities. Today’s obscure artists will be the Mozart’s, Picasso’s, and Spielberg’s of tomorrow. The Internet has brought most of the things to our homes but art is something we must experience in person!
If you’re staying at the Aria next to the Church of St. Stephen, you’re in a good place to start.
Most of the museums are within walking distance between 1–3 miles and you’ll get to see the other landmarks of Budapest along the way!
So let’s get started!
Want to check out some contemporary art museums further up?
Both of these museums looked pretty cool, unfortunately the Q was temporarily closed for installation.
If you’re already tired or didn’t see anything interesting you can check out the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which features 18 pools and saunas but also has an exciting retro architecture, which reminded me of high school.
But maybe you’re not done yet. Walk down past the ruin bars to the Palace District.
Have a drink or two here, usually you’ll find some live music, poetry reading, or lively conversation!
From here there are a few advanced options:
About 25 minutes away is the Ludwig Museum, related to the Mumok in Vienna. It’s worth seeing some of the collection which includes Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and Joseph Beuys.
Cross the bridge and at the base of Gellért-hegy Jubileumi park is Faur Zsófi Gallery. We hiked to the top of it, but the park is still undergoing renovations but a stunning view nonetheless.
Also closeby is the music venue A38, where we were lucky enough to see the band Henge.
Not tired yet? Cross the chain bridge and get to the Buda side of the city.
In the oldest part of the city, Obuda, stands a shrine to one of the city’s most famous contemporary artists, Victor Vasarely, the father of the optical art movement.
Then cross back over to Pest and hit Kalman Maklary Fine Arts an interesting contemporary gallery (no exhibitions this year yet) which is close to parliament and a short stroll from the Aria.
If you happen to come in mid October, check out Art Market Budapest which is also near the first round of galleries near the opera house and the Aria.
Now if you didn’t finish all of that in your two day pre-cruise, don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to come back at the end of the cruise!
Sailing
The Slovak National Gallery is close to where the ship docks.
Three options for the outskirts of the city; I don’t think you can walk here, you might need to take a taxi, bike, or public transportation.
Rudavskys Magic Garden: The garden is closed for the winter, but looks incredible when it’s warmer!
The Július Koller Society
Tranzit
Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum: This looks like a very cool museum atop a peninsula jutting into the Danube. I didn’t see it from the ship, but along with its sculpture park, it seems like an awesome place to check out the latest contemporary art!
Sailing
The next stop is in the Wachau Valley, specifically Durnstein. While Durnstein is a quiet town with not much contemporary art, 8km from Durnstein is a small cosmopolitan town, Krems an der Donau, with some interesting art options.
The map is zoomed out to show the proximity to Durnstein where the ship is docked.
Sailing
The following day we docked and took about a 90 minute bus ride to the quaint city of Salzburg, known for being the birthplace of Mozart. It’s also known for being the backdrop to the 1960’s classic The Sound of Music.
The city is surrounded by a steep rock face which made it an impenetrable during times of war. However, the top of mountain is a contemporary art museum. You get natural and manmade art from the top of the elevator ride!
But before we get there, global gallery Thaddaeus Ropac has two locations in Salzburg! Check to see if there are exhibitions at the farther one near the train station before you trek up there.
Finally, Galerie HAAS & GSCHWANDTNER is moving from its downtown location to somewhere else within Salzburg. Check their website to see where they end up!
Sailing
We made it! Vienna, Austria the largest, most cosmopolitan city on the Danube. The art scene here is huge with tons of galleries, museums, and history.
We will try to avoid the two most famous artists from Austria, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, because the Neue Gallery on 86th and 5th in New York houses Ronald Lauder’s huge collection of Austrian art including Klimt’s Lady in Gold.
The bus to old city will drop you about 5 minutes northeast of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
There are a lot of galleries in the first district, here’s the east side of the city first.
The west side is next, the order is assuming that you are coming from the bus drop off location
On the east side of the outer museum loop
There are a few major art fairs that take place in Vienna:
March: Spark Art Fair
May: Affordable Art Fair
September: Vienna Contemporary and Curated By
November: Vienna Art Week
Austrian artists that I didn’t get a chance to see:
Stefan Eins: He stopped by my Times Square exhibition multiple times and had some crazy stories about when he started Fashion Moda in the South Bronx in the 80s.
Andre Heller: Multi-hyphenate who commissioned Luna Luna
Helmut Lang: the famed photographer
Franz West: Sculptor and artist
On the outskirts of the city is the Essl Museum, which houses what is considered the most important collection of Austrian art after 1945.
From here the ship sails back to the beginning port, Budapest.
Did we miss something? Drop a comment and we’ll be sure to check it out next time and let you know how it was.
Interested in recreating this experience? (You’ll now have the maps to save time instead of us stumbling around)
Here’s the link to the AmaWaterways cruise and the Aria hotel, which is voted the best in Central Europe consistently!
NB: There was an issue with Google Maps acting weird so instead of wasting time figuring it out, I made different maps for each art “district” in Budapest and Vienna.

An Austrian Wildlife Icon
These cute animals are European Ground Squirrels, which I saw whilst on holiday in Vienna.
I hadn’t even heard of them until quite recently. Over the last few years, the British media have been publishing more and more photos of ground squirrels and other wildlife in Vienna. Eventually, I couldn’t resist heading over to Austria to see what was going on for myself.
There are plenty of public parks in Vienna, but, as far as I know, only a couple of them have ground squirrels. All of my photos were taken at the Blumengärten Hirschstetten, which you can get to quite easily by tram.
Visit in spring or summer, and you should have a great chance of seeing the squirrels. I spotted several within minutes of arriving, and one of them ran right up to my feet as if it was welcoming me to the park.
I assume the squirrels are used to people feeding them, although there are signs asking you not to.

Since I am currently in Munich but usually live in Vienna, I would like to highlight the differences between Viennese and Munich residents. At first glance, one might not believe that Munich residents differ so much from Viennese, but a comparison reveals significant differences. Let’s first compare the cities to illustrate the differences.
The most noticeable difference is that Vienna is the capital of Austria, while Munich is “only” a large city in Germany. Munich is slightly smaller than Vienna and has fewer inhabitants. Although Munich has only three-quarters of Vienna’s population, it is three times as wealthy, which is evident in the people.
Usually, the population is divided into three classes: lower, middle, and upper class. In Munich, however, there seems to be no clear middle class, and the upper class appears very snobbish. This does not mean that there is no middle class, but rather that it is less noticeable. You see either people who look wealthy or those who appear poorer. The middle class behaves more subtly and hides in public: they either dress elegantly to appear upper class or wear normal clothes, making them seem poorer. I correct my previous statement and say that the middle class behaves discreetly. Now let’s look at the people in Vienna.
Vienna is divided into districts, but there are only a few districts that clearly represent a social class. Even in the wealthy districts, there are hardly any snobs or visibly rich people. In Vienna, the middle class predominates. Everyone looks as if they earn roughly the same. There are exceptions here as well, just like in Munich.
Although I have strongly criticized Munich here, it is a beautiful city. Of course, there are also unfriendly people in Munich, but I have not encountered any so far. In conclusion, both Munich and Vienna are worth visiting.

It’s hard to believe that I’ve now been in Vienna for over a year. I’ve seen so much, but there is so much more of the city to explore.
Often I spend Saturdays walking around trying to see something new. Yesterday was exactly that.
I discovered there is an English-language bookstore here so I headed there first. I do speak and read German fluently, but I prefer English books (also to keep my English going, since I mainly live and work in German here).
The shop is appropriately called Shakespeare & Company, located in the center of Vienna at Sterngasse 2 not too far from the Danube canal. It is stuffed full of all kinds of books both fiction and non-fiction. It was a fun place to browse!
Then I wandered around that area, which I hadn’t really seen in detail so far, heading toward a meeting with a friend. The café we wanted to go to was sadly closed, so we headed across the canal to the 2nd district and a lovely café/bistro called Goldener Papagei (Golden Parrot) at Praterstrasse 17. We sat outside, though it was a very windy day. There are many tables under some lovely trees: a perfect spot for a chat and a drink.
The perfect day came to a close meeting an American friend from Germany for dinner at one of my favorite Israeli restaurants, Makom, at Schottenfeldgasse 18 in the 7th district.

You know that feeling when a song hits you right in the gut? Like, it wasn’t just made for you, but like it somehow knew what you needed to hear before you even did? That’s what “Vienna” by Billy Joel did to me.
I came across that song again during my drive home, on a random night just a few weeks ago, when I was overanalyzing my life, my future, and whether I’m already too late to do something meaningful. The classic mid-to-late 20s spiral, you know? One minute I’m driving slowly through the city, the next I’m questioning my entire existence.
Then, boom; “Vienna waits for you”.
I don’t know what it is about that line, but it unlocked something in me. I’ve never thought about, let alone visited Vienna. Maybe it’s the gentle piano intro. Maybe it’s the way Billy sings it like a wise old friend sitting next to me at 3AM, telling me to breathe.
“Slow down, you crazy child. You’re so ambitious for a juvenile.”
I felt exposed. How dare he come for my entire personality like that? But also, he’s right. I am ambitious. I’ve always wanted to get things done fast, prove myself, complete all the milestones before I hit my imaginary deadline. And lately, that mindset has been eating at me. I kept thinking, “Why don’t I have everything figured out yet?”
But Vienna reminds me that I don’t have to. I’m still young. A 26 year-old is basically a 6 year-old in the “adult” life. And “youth” doesn’t mean I have to hustle 24/7. It means I have time to figure things out. It means I can still dream big without burning out trying to make it happen as fast as possible.
There’s something deeply comforting about being told that it’s okay to not be in a rush. We don’t get that a lot. Being told that success doesn’t expire at 30. That if I haven’t landed my dream job, or released that album, or written that book yet, it doesn’t mean I have failed. It just means I’m still on my way.
And that’s more than okay.
“Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.”
That line gets me every time. Because that fire, yes. I have felt it. I still feel it. The desire to do something great, to not waste time. But sometimes, that fire turns into anxiety. Into comparison. Into restlessness. And this song basically told me, “Hey, chill. You have time. You’re doing fine.”
Lately, every time I get overwhelmed about the future or about the feeling like I’m not doing enough, I put this song on. And for those three and a half minutes, I always feel like the noise quiets down. I remember that life isn’t a race. That I don’t have to catch up to anyone. That I’m allowed to take detours, to pause, to just… be.
And beyond all that, the song just feels beautiful. The melody is gentle, a little wistful, but hopeful. It’s not sad. It’s patient. Like Vienna itself, whatever it symbolizes, it can wait. It’s not going anywhere. And neither is my worth.
I think the main thing that Vienna taught me is: I’m not late. I’m not behind. I’m exactly where I need to be. And sometimes, slowing things down is the most powerful thing I can do.
Because Vienna waits for me.
And that’s more than enough.

The Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons, dubbed “Humanity at the Crossroads,” addressed the urgent need to regulate deadly autonomous weapons systems. As a youth delegate, I gained valuable insights into this critical issue. Here’s a snapshot of what I learned:
Understanding the Big Picture
The conference shed light on the serious challenges posed by autonomous weapons. They could make conflicts worse, harm civilians, and disrupt efforts to keep peace worldwide.
Why Human Control Matters
A key lesson was the importance of humans staying in charge of decisions about using force. Letting machines make life-or-death choices raises big moral and legal questions. We need clear rules to make sure people are responsible and to stop these weapons from causing harm.
Talking Ethics
We spent time discussing what’s right and wrong when it comes to autonomous weapons. We talked about how to respect people’s dignity and protect them from these weapons’ dangers. We also thought about how using these weapons might change society in the long run and change our relationship with technology.
Challenges We Face
Even though many people agree on the need for rules, there are still big challenges ahead. Some powerful governments and tech companies control a lot of the conversation. It’s tough for other voices, like from everyday people and community groups, to be heard.
Youth Power
Young people like us played a big part in the conference. Our fresh ideas and energy showed how important it is to get everyone involved in the discussion to address autonomous weapons. We left feeling inspired and ready to push for change in our communities.
What Comes Next
The conference wasn’t just talk, it was a call to action. We agreed to work even harder to establish strong global rules for autonomous weapons. But it won’t happen overnight. We need to keep up the pressure and work together to make real change.
In sum, the Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons was a chance to learn, share ideas, and get ready for action. We learned how crucial it is to keep humans in control of decisions about life and death in warfare. As we move forward, let’s stay focused on making the world safer and fairer for everyone.

“Be a fool. For love. For yourself.” -Bourdain
I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So, even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train. We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars. They didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like Coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing.
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: How are you doing since your dad died? Wanna let anything out?
Me: Well… I’m doing terrible, actually. He left me with all this pain and anger I don’t deserve or know what to do with. I thought he’d take it with him when he died, but somehow, he transferred it to me, and now I feel worse than I did when he was alive. If I’d known I’d feel this way in the end, I wouldn’t have cared about him so much; I wouldn’t have spent my whole life concerned about his health. What was the fucking point? Why did I put myself through all that when I didn’t have to?
Caroline: Sam, you learned how to be empathetic, and compassionate. You care about people deeply, that’s very rare. Those are all wonderful qualities you should be proud of. You took on responsibilities that no child should have to take on, but they only made you stronger, whether you see it now or not. Death is a part of life, and it sounds like you looked it right in the eye. It’s an experience you’ll cherish one day. I believe that. With time, the pain will ease, and you’ll begin to see the experience in a different light. Trust me.
Me: How do you know this?
Caroline: I’m an owl.
Me: So, what do I do in the meantime, until the pain eases?
Caroline: I don’t know, just keep hopping around. You’ll figure it out.

We arrived in Vienna with no plans, and nowhere to stay, so we walked around the city center looking for a hostel. When we got tired of carrying our bags, we stopped in a bar to rest and ask for directions. Before Google and Yelp, it was bartenders who could tell you about every business within a 5-mile radius. “Don’t go to that one. Go to this one. Ask for Ron. Tell him I sent you.” There’s very little of that anymore.
The music disturbed me as soon as we walked in.
Me: What is this hot garbage they’re playing?
Caroline: It sounds like David Hasselhoff.
Me: You’re not going to believe this, but, in America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch. Isn’t that crazy?
Caroline: Are you being serious right now?
Me: Yeah, the same exact name.
Caroline: IT’S THE SAME PERSON.
Me: Wait… So, he’s a musician too?
Caroline: He’s the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He’s put out more than 20 albums.
Me: Are you sure there aren’t two of them?
Caroline: We also have Baywatch in Australia. I don’t live on the moon.
While having a drink, we met a few fellow backpackers who were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner. They kindly walked us there, and to our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point, like almost hotel-level nice. There was a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and I was ahead of my planned Adderall pace because I was too kind to Simon. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of juice too.
That night we shared a few bottles of wine (that was considered not drinking for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border, along with some ultra-thin paper, and I wanted to put them to use. I LOVE thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in my hand. As a kid, tracing paper was my jam. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers wouldn’t let me. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular notebook paper and crumple it to make it softer.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far.
Aye,
You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It was as bad as you think it would be, maybe worse. I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, though, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though.
I talked to Caroline about my dad’s death yesterday. She, you, and 2 random ladies I met in Paris are the only ones who know how I’ve been feeling. I’m trying my hardest to share, but I don’t want to be a constant downer, ya know? Caroline told me it’ll get easier, like you did, but I just hope I’m not too far gone before the tide turns. Her brother died tragically, but she has more perspective than me because she’s an owl. I’m a frog, by the way. I’ll explain later.
I told Caroline about you, and she said to send her regards. So… Regards. I miss you, man. See you on the flip side.
Sam
The place was nearly full when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. We each had to take a single bed in one that was already occupied. So, after kissing goodnight, we parted ways.
Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. God, what an amazing feeling that was… Walking the halls before school, passing by your crush’s locker over and over, trying to make your meeting seem unplanned. “Oh me, I was just going to chemistry. Funny seeing you here,” you say, as if you’re not mentally orgasming. If they made a drug to capture that feeling, we’d all be addicted.
April 8, 2006
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught Caroline the rules of chess. Kevin was the one who taught me how to play. He’d beat me every single time then say something nice like “you’re really improving.” It only pissed me off more, but he meant it. We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be. I could tell how much she enjoyed feeling me press up against her. At one point she reached behind me to pull me closer, and I got an erection.
Me: I never thought I’d get a boner while playing chess.
Caroline: What is wrong with you?
Me: It’s a natural reaction to friction.
Caroline: Jeez, that’s not what I meant. Why do you say these things out loud?
Me: Isn’t that just part of my charm?
Caroline: I guess so, Mr. McEnroe. I guess so.
*
We went to a museum that afternoon, but for the life of me I can’t remember which one, or what was inside. It could have been dinosaur bones or art; I have no clue. Museums aren’t my thing. They do absolutely nothing for me. I mean, I want to party, not stare at a party.
A Mitch Hedberg joke comes to mind…
“I was at a craft fair and there was a jar of Jellybeans. The guy said, ‘Guess how many Jellybeans are in the jar, and win a prize’. Aw, come on man, let me just have some.”
I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards I bought a sausage accompanied with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few teens laughed and pointed while I poured water on my face to cool down. One kid called me a “Mus-tard.” I’ll never forget that little bastard.
When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about the smell of weed, I would have gotten high much earlier. I’ve always enjoyed spreading weed smoke to the masses. If you don’t like the smell, too bad. I don’t like your smell either.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush, Laura, loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?
When we got there around 8pm we were the only ones in the place. The entire bar was empty, the tables and booths too. The bartender welcomed us like he’d been waiting for company and waved us over to the bar. He looked visibly disappointed when we beelined for a booth. Neither of us were in the mood for small talk, so each time we needed drinks, I walked up to the bar to order. It became increasingly awkward with each trip, so I started ordering in bunches, which seemed to only bother him more. We were chasing beers with shots of Caroline’s favorite drink, Sambuca. You know how I feel about Sambuca. “You have to drink it,” she told me, “It’s named after you.”
We got drunk fast, and after a few rounds we were making out at the table. The bartender gave us nasty “get a room” looks, but we ignored him. Then, I devised a plan, one that has been devised many a time before, but never by me.
Me: Meet me in the bathroom.
I said it with confidence. It didn’t require a response. It was a command.
When she burst in, I pulled her pants down and put her in the sink, something I hadn’t premeditated. I was in a flow state. I took her shirt off and she did the same with mine.
Caroline: Do you have a condom?
Me: Shit, I don’t.
Caroline: You didn’t get one?
Me: I forgot.
Then, we heard a knock at the door.
Bartender: We don’t allow fucking in here. Come out now or I’m coming in.
We scrambled to put our clothes back on, then I opened the door. The bartender was still standing there, bill in hand.
Bartender: I added a cleaning fee. Pay now and go.
I handed him whatever money I had on me, then Caroline and I ran out laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, but Caroline laughed. She had no shame. Mid-vomit she posed a very serious question.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean, tonight? This doesn’t seem like a very high note.
Caroline: No, I mean “us.” Like, tonight we go to bed, and we never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: Holding your hair back while you vomit?
Caroline: No. I mean, before we complicate things. I want you to live in my mind as a perfect memory.
Me: It’s not because you don’t want to have sex with me, right?
Caroline: I very much want to have sex with you. It isn’t about that. It’s about preserving a special memory and locking it away in a little box that you can peek in whenever you want. I want you just like this.
Me: I could use a box with something nice in it… Right now, I only have ones I want to keep shut.
Caroline: You see what I’m saying?
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Yeah.
Me: What if we end up seeing each other again in another country?
Caroline: Then it was meant to be.
Me: Fair enough, pretty lady.
Caroline: Goodbye, my sweet Johnny Mac.
Me: Goodbye, Caroline.
I walked her to her room, gave her a kiss on the cheek, and that was it. She flew away the next morning, leaving me to hop around on my own, with my little box.

In praise of 15 minute cities: Why a ‘city of short distances’ feels better.
“People realised the state of their neighbourhoods could change. They could enjoy life in front of their front doors without owning a garden, without having a balcony,” said Vienna’s former Deputy Mayor, Maria Vassilakou.
Rated no.1 in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Global Liveability Index, Vienna frequently places as one of the world’s top cities to live in. And while it’s never explicitly called a 15- or 20-minute city, it nevertheless responds to the social, technological and ecological challenges that we all face.
Described as “the city of short distances”, urban planning policy in the city has long put pedestrians first (since the 80s, in fact). And, a few decades down the line, the results are evident everywhere: pavement expansions, improvements to public transport connectivity, sports provision and — notably — the longest continuous pedestrianised space in Europe, in the form of shopping street Mariahilferstraße.
Vienna feels equitable and inclusive, too. It’s affordable, for starters. And a focus on gender mainstreaming, a strategy adopted to achieve gender equality in society, has translated to things like fully illuminated footpaths, more entrances and exits to parks, grants for neighbourhood open space, and additional premiums for research conducted by women — a real-world commitment to urban planning that’s led by the needs and safety of citizens.
LIVEABILITY SCORE: 8/10. A compact and connected city geared towards pedestrians, safety and people-first infrastructure.

Congratulations! You managed to make the girl who didn’t believe in love fall for you.
You made her believe the two of you shared something special, something meant to be.
You made her feel like you’d never truly hurt her.
She had her doubts, but they were born out of fear — fear because she loved you so much that she couldn’t imagine life without you.
She thought she was just being protective of her heart, until one day, all her fears became reality.
She watched the man she loved with her whole heart hurt her and let her down.
Seeing you talk to your ex, sounding so happy, broke something deep inside her.
Every “I love you” and “I promise” now feels like empty words.
She wonders how someone who says they love you could hurt you so deeply, break your trust, and make you feel like a fool for believing in them.
And yet, she stays.
She tries to work through it because she doesn’t want to give up on you.
But your words are starting to cut deeper than you realize.
She’s “too emotional,” a “pick me,” or just the “sad girl.”
The person she once felt so close and safe with now feels like a stranger.
She’s scared to be herself, scared to open up. Her heart no longer feels safe with the man she loves.
The worst part?
There’s still nothing she wouldn’t do for you. She’d destroy herself emotionally a million times over if it meant making you happy.

Vienna is such a historic city known everywhere around the world for its art and culture. Here is an article that will help you to enjoy your trip in the capital of Austria.
Also, remember that I’m writing on Medium and that growing a huge community over there is very important for me. The name of my channel is “Clément Delabruyère” so please follow my channel : https://medium.com/@clement.delabruyere
Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a fascinating city that blends history with modernism. Covering an area of around 414 km², it is home to almost 1.9 million inhabitants. With its cobbled streets, Baroque palaces and prestigious museums, Vienna is a true cultural and architectural gem.
The city is divided into 23 districts, each offering its own unique charm and ambience. Vienna plays a major geopolitical role as the headquarters of numerous international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
Classical music has a special place in Vienna’s history, having witnessed the birth of legendary composers such as Mozart, Beethoven and Strauss. Viennese waltzes and famous operas still thrill the city. Vienna is also renowned for its culinary tradition, with historic cafés offering delicious pastries such as sachertorte.
The Schönbrunn Palace, a former imperial residence, and St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic icon, are among the iconic sites to visit. Well-tended gardens and abundant green spaces, notably Prater Park, add to Viennese quality of life.
Vienna stands out for its concern for sustainability and quality of life, regularly topping world rankings in this area. Its efficient public transport system and green initiatives are testimony to this commitment.
In short, Vienna embodies an enchanting blend of historical heritage, artistic creativity and contemporary progress, making it a city that captivates the hearts and minds of those who discover it.
Vienna’s history dates back to antiquity, when the Romans established a military camp on the banks of the Danube around the 1st century AD. This camp, called Vindobona, was the starting point for the city’s development. Over the centuries, Vindobona flourished as a point of convergence for trade routes and cultures, benefiting from its strategic position at the crossroads of Central Europe.
In the Middle Ages, Vienna became an important political and cultural center under the Babenbergs, then the Habsburgs from the 13th century onwards. In 1440, Emperor Frederick III established the imperial residence in Vienna, laying the foundations for a long period of imperial grandeur.
The 16th century saw Vienna confronted with the challenges posed by the Ottoman wars, with the sieges of Vienna in 1529 and 1683. These sieges were crucial moments in the city’s history, marking unsuccessful Ottoman attempts to conquer Central Europe.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Vienna became the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a major power in Europe. During this period, the city became a center of classical music and art, home to such geniuses as Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Baroque architecture flourished, giving rise to iconic buildings such as Schönbrunn Palace.
The 20th century was marked by upheaval, including two world wars and the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. After the Second World War, Vienna was divided into four zones of occupation, reflecting the Cold War period.
After the end of the occupation in 1955, Vienna regained its status as Austrian capital and diplomatic center. It hosted international organizations such as the UN and OPEC, consolidating its position in world affairs.
Today, Vienna continues to shine as a cosmopolitan city, blending its historic heritage with a dynamic modernity. The city has preserved its rich past while looking to the future, making it one of Europe’s leading cultural and intellectual destinations.
This imperial palace and its magnificent gardens are a symbol of the opulence of the Austrian Empire. Don’t miss a tour of the palace’s sumptuous rooms and a stroll through the well-kept gardens.
This iconic Gothic cathedral dominates downtown Vienna. Its elaborate architecture and impressive spire make it a must-see.
This Baroque complex comprises two palaces and superb gardens. It houses a remarkable collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt, notably “The Kiss”.
World-renowned for its superb acoustics and artistic performances, the opera house is an iconic venue for classical music lovers.
A former imperial palace, the Hofburg today houses several museums and institutions, including the Austrian National Library and the Sissi Museum.
This museum houses an exceptional collection of graphic art, including drawings, engravings and prints by masters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Dürer.
These two museums are located side by side and offer impressive collections of art and natural history.
This city park is home to the famous Wiener Riesenrad, Vienna’s iconic Ferris wheel, as well as numerous attractions, restaurants and green spaces.
These venues represent just a fraction of what Vienna has to offer in terms of culture, history and entertainment. The city is full of treasures to explore, and each corner offers a unique and enriching experience for visitors.
An Austrian composer prodigy, Mozart is one of the most influential figures in classical music. He composed over 600 works, including operas, symphonies and concertos, making a profound impact on the European musical landscape.
The father of psychoanalysis, Freud revolutionized our understanding of human psychology. His theories on the unconscious, the Oedipus complex and the role of dreams left a lasting imprint on the human sciences.
German composer and pianist, although born in Bonn, Beethoven spent much of his life in Vienna. He is famous for his transition from Classicism to Romanticism, with emblematic works such as his 9th Symphony.
Austrian Symbolist painter and leading figure of the Vienna Secession, Klimt is known for his ornate portraits and bold works, including “The Kiss”. He helped shape Art Nouveau and Modernism.
An Austrian Expressionist artist, Schiele was renowned for his provocative portraits and bold artistic vision. His unique style left a lasting imprint on 20th-century art, despite his untimely death at the age of 28.
These five figures left a significant mark on the history of art, music, psychology and culture in Vienna and around the world.
In order to conclude, if you have any ideas for improving this type of article (adding a section, for example), please let me know in the comments. Also, if there’s a place in the world that you particularly like and would like me to write another article about, I invite you to submit your ideas too.

Until I arrived at the airport, I could believe this was indeed happening and that it was not a dream anymore. It has been three years since my last travelling on holiday, and since then, I have been longing for the day that I could travel again.
On the flight to my destination, I imagined what would happen on this holiday and recalled my last memory on a flight. Who could imagine the world would have a massive change in such a short period?
After a two-and-a-half-hour flight from the UK, I arrived at my destination, Vienna. I have always wanted to visit Vienna. As the capital city of Austria, voted as one of the safest cities in Europe, which is best for solo travelling, like what I am doing.
“You must visit Schoenbrunn Palace. It is one of the most impressive landmarks in Vienna,” said my father. Before going on the trip, many people told me the same thing.
After 20 minute ride on the metro, I arrived at Schoenbrunn station. Once leaving the station…

The first time I heard Vienna by Billy Joel, I was on a train home after college, the world outside dipped in the amber light of a tired evening. I had just bombed an interview I had poured my soul into. My head was a whirlwind of spiralling doubts — about my future, about whether I had what it takes, about everything. And then Vienna arrived — not like a pop anthem or an uplifting chorus, but like a friend who sits with you in silence and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
“Slow down, you crazy child
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you’re so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid?”
In that moment, tears welled up — not because of the failure, but because of how deeply the song understood the ache behind it. How it met me in the in-between, where so many of us live: driven but unsure, hopeful but exhausted.
That lyric wasn’t just about me. It was about a generation raised to hustle, to quantify their worth through grades, internships, side projects, and glowing LinkedIn posts. I had come to think of life as a ladder. But Vienna whispered of a different metaphor — a garden, perhaps. Something that grows in time, with pauses, with pruning, with seasons of bloom and rest.
It reminded me of The Midnight Library by Matt Haig — a book about a woman who, burdened by regret, stumbles upon a mystical library containing infinite versions of her life. Each book in the library reveals a different path she could have taken. The novel forces you to ask: what if the life you’re racing toward isn’t the one that would’ve made you happy? What if the pauses, the missed exits, the so-called failures, are the very fabric of the life meant for you?
“When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?”
In Joel’s metaphor, Vienna isn’t a destination you rush to. It’s the life that waits — patiently, quietly — for you to stop sprinting long enough to hear its music. It’s the version of you that grows not by doing more, but by understanding what enough feels like. That revelation mirrored the essence of The Midnight Library: the idea that you’re not a failure just because you’re not on someone else’s timeline.
The truth is, I didn’t need a new plan that day on the train. I needed perspective. I needed someone — or something — to tell me that I hadn’t missed my moment, that there are many doors yet to open. And Vienna, in its tender, piano-laced wisdom, did exactly that.
“You can get what you want or you can just get old
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through”
Those words haunted me. Because I had never thought of burnout as a kind of death. But that’s what it is: the death of wonder, of joy, of being here. I was chasing a life so hard that I was forgetting to live the one already unfolding around me.
Billy Joel’s Vienna didn’t just soften my ambition — it redefined it. It told me that ambition rooted in fear is a form of imprisonment. But ambition rooted in patience? In stillness? That’s purpose. That’s wisdom.
So now, when I feel that panic — that rising tide of “not enough,” of “too late,” of “what am I doing with my life?” — I don’t drown. I return to the song. To Joel’s voice, gently guiding me back.
“Slow down, you’re doing fine.”
And just like the woman in The Midnight Library learns: the life you’re meant to live isn’t the one with the loudest applause. It’s the one where you’re fully alive. The one that waits for you — just like Vienna.

Things that I’m a sucker for while traveling: a unique building, a nice park, and a spooky cemetery. I will go out of my way to see these. Even if it means traveling across an entire city.
So years ago, when I was traveling in Vienna with my parents, that’s exactly what I did. I had heard about this cool building, called Hundertwasserhaus.
Although I was in my 30s, living on my own in a foreign country, and had traveled around the world, my mom didn’t want me to go alone. So she tagged along.
It’s curved, it’s straight, it’s a building, and it’s a garden.
Hundertwasserhaus is hard to describe, but it overloads your mind when you see it. There is so much to look at.
It is a colorful, eclectic apartment building. It was built in the 1980s with multiple styles and built on different planes. The windows are different sizes. The facade changes from stucco to trompe l’oeil to brick to mosaic. The street level boasts unusual, non-uniform colorful columns.
Trees pop out of the building in unexpected places. The artist called these trees on the building “tree tenants.”

→ Martin Hanley: A Memoir
This memoir was written in 2004/2005
I was born on March 14th, 1931 to Margarethe and Leopold Hahn of Neueweltgasse 23 in Hietzing, Vienna. Hitzing, then as now, was a pleasant leafy, upmarket suburb, our home perhaps just ten blocks distant from Schonbrun Palace, one of the sumptuous palaces built by the Habsburg dynasty.
One of my earliest recollections goes back to the age of 5. Opposite our first floor apartment was a little triangle of grass, with a few flowers and 2 garden benches, which was tucked in between our building and the main road, the Hitzinger Hauptstrasse. The apartment had deep window ledges on which I could stand and lean against the wrought iron railings which were erected for security reasons. Later I watched Hitler’s tanks roll into Vienna from this balcony. As we lived on the 1st floor there were only a few steps to the ground floor and I was allowed to ride on the garden path alone on a tricycle parked in a ‘cave’ under the building. After the war I visited our old home with Susi my wife, and found the ‘cave’ to be a little opening in the building near the staircase outside.
Apart from the “Schonbrun” palace of the Emperors, Hitzing boasted a zoo and many coffee houses of note. The coffee house was an important factor in my parents’ generations enjoyment of life. Its ambience, seating arrangements, free offering of daily newspapers to its clientele, not to mention the quality of its coffee and ‘mehlspeisen’ or cakes was serious business, similar in importance to the Anglo Saxon pub or the American local bar.
Listening to stories of the older generation I realized that although acquisition of luxuries and assets were not on the agenda, my parents and their circles lived a very agreeable life. I have pictures of family holidays taken in villages, on lovely lakes, of my parents at parties and so on. It can be explained by understanding the culture of European middle class life. In Austria, especially Vienna, the culture of theatre, music, stays in the country in summer and skiing from peasant huts in the mountains in winter was maintained to a greater or smaller degree.
Living on the outskirts of Vienna there were advantages for me, as in winter I could be taken on my sled to the ‘Rotenberg’ or Red Hill to slide up and down in the snow on fine afternoons. My Nanny would pull the sled up this little hill in company with other nursemaids similarly out with their charges. Nanny was a fixture, and one of whom I have fond memories. I have a picture of her with me in my leather pants aged perhaps two or three. She also cooked and made the beds. As she had off only one Sunday every fortnight some might say that she lived in slavery. Not so. She was part of the family and had a home which was warm in winter and where meals were regular. A small pittance was hers to spend as well. Far different from where she came from. This enabled people like my parents to live a very civilised life with very little money.
In the depression, working people in industry or on the land saw real hardship. I was given a spare lunch to school to distribute to children less fortunate than I.
My father was a hard worker all his life. In the 1920s and 30s he worked as a salesman in his father’s firm, Adolf Hahne & Sohne, a merchant of “spitzen” — feathers, boas, lace and embroideries, the traditional Austrian lace, still seen in minute quantities today, was used on almost every woman’s garment. In white or colourful on ‘dirndl’, the traditional skirt, for blouses, on caps and underwear. The firm had prospered in the period when ‘Dirndl’, the Austrian national costume, was the mode. Manufactured and distributed worldwide, laces were an important ingredient of fashion for what must have been at least 2 generations, as my grandfather had inherited the business. In my father’s time his 2 sons were in the business, both as salesmen. My Uncle Walter’s sales territory was part of Germany and France. He enjoyed himself very much one believes as he was single, tall and handsome. He had a good time by all accounts.
My father, on the other hand, was allotted the tougher territory, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia and suchlike. Although also handsome, he was already married and the small traders he dealt with, mostly Jewish haberdashers in little country towns were prone to be cashless, especially after a family wedding, birth or bar mitzvah. He travelled for several weeks at a time, in a small ‘Steyer’ motor car on terrible country roads.
In Vienna, in the thirties, survival in business was not always guaranteed. The Depression had driven my grandfather’s firm into bankruptcy three times. Bankruptcy in those days evolved into a sort of payment agreement, in German: “ausgleich”. Say you owed a hundred thousand with no prospect of paying it back. You settled with your creditors for whatever, agreed….and then carried on. My father’s stories to me of his “ausgleich” experiences with his customers, though funny, hid the tensions of those times.
When Hitler walked into Vienna, Jewish premises were “Arisiert”, meaning literally ‘Arienised’ (as in Aryan!) ie. Nazified…Nazi hoodlums, some in uniforms, entered, demanded all keys and normally gave the occupants a few hours to take their personal effects and get out. Confiscated just like that… period, full stop… premises, stock, bank accounts.
That didn’t happen to Adolf Hahn & Sohn, because the business had gone broke some years before. The company went into receivership in 1932. The Depression added another victim, but it not only the lack of business which was the cause. My grandfather, who must have been well in his sixties, married Claire, an elegant woman a good 30 years his junior. This necessitated a new house with fine furniture and the trimmings. The romance proved too big a burden on the business, as well as the two family members who worked in it.
The German Wehrmacht were welcomed by the Austrian populace after the “Kristallnacht” Troops occupied Vienna from March 13th, 1938. On March 14th, my birthday, I stood on my window balcony and observed with childish fascination the armoured wagons, mobile cannons and personnel trucks standing on the road outside, the uniformed Wehrmacht soldiers laughing and joking with the locals while the Hietzing Synagogue around the corner was torched.
We lived in the same apartment until we escaped from Vienna, except for the very last few days when we stayed hidden in a city apartment owned by ‘Tante Ida’, my grandfather’s sister and a very old lady. I was later told my father had already hidden there for a few days previously.
In the months from the Anschluss till we left the country in September 1938, I continued to attend the same school. My only vivid memory was of the same teacher, but he was wearing a red armband with a black swastika on a white circle and the Hebrew teacher’s red star of David on a yellow armband. We children did not wear any outward marking at that time.
It was time to leave Austria, where my family roots went back at least for the 3 generations I knew.

By 1938, America, England, Canada, Australia and most other countries had either tightened immigration intake or outright banned foreigners. Apparently a Mr. Rogers, an Australian businessman, was visiting Vienna in 1938 and somehow met our family. He offered to help and assisted my father applying for a visa to Australia, sponsoring us. The application was refused. Mr. Rogers subsequently wrote telling my father that stating to be a tradesman as a “chauffeur” was the worst entry possible as his son, aged 17, “could drive a car better than you can!” That was the end of that.
The Depression had not lifted entirely in most of the Western world. In any case, the few who did receive visas to desired country destinations had to have sums of money my father did not possess. My grandfather’s business, in which my father and his brother Walter worked, barely supported the family. This was not entirely due to economic conditions — it has been attributed largely to my grandfather’s second marriage to a beautiful woman some 30 years younger than himself. She apparently required a new house with the best trimmings.
Jews who didn’t make it to desired country destinations had the possibility of buying passports for entry to South American countries like Argentina and Uruguay. Switzerland was open only to the super rich, and then only as permanent ‘tourists’. Refugees like my parents, who left matters too late with very little money, found safety in the few destinations that made no demands. There was Shanghai, Trinidad, Curacao, and small black African states. Israel, Palestine in those days, was quite sealed against Jewish immigration by British decree, although several hundred young people entered and were smuggled in right throughout the war.
You didn’t need an entry visa, you just had to get there.
My parents found a way to Shanghai, as did about 19,000 Jewish refugees from Hitler. A temporary “Thru-visa” was available from Italy. This was issued on sight of a steamship ticket to Shanghai purchased from Italian line Lloyd Triestino, on one of the boats that steamed a regular route from Genoa to Shanghai, for an exorbitant sum. Only First Class tickets were available as a matter of course. I don’t know how but this sum was found for the Hahn family of 2 adults and a child. Train tickets were purchased to Genoa.
I remember a young girl, about my age, boarded the train with us. I never learned what was the family’s relationship to us, but my parents agreed to take her along. She was taken off the train at the border between Austria and Italy during the night, I presume because she was without papers. I have never been told what became of her and I have since often wondered whether she was returned to Vienna and her parents safely.
After a few days in Genoa we embarked on the mv. Victoria, the smallest but newest of the Lloyd Triestino fleet that sailed to the Orient regularly. We owned several ‘cabin trunks’ full of possessions and 114 British pounds. The voyage was a great delight for my parents, despite what must have been anxiety for the future. The mv. Victoria was the smallest ship in the line, but the latest and most modern.
First class service in all respects was still pre-war and luxurious. The voyage was very romantic, landing at exotic ports along the way. In Port Said, at the southern end of the Suez Canal, a great fête was held with native dancers and a feast was prepared on the dock. I believe it was an Egyptian version of an Aussie barbecue with whole beasts being cooked. Local citizens were present as well as the ship’s passengers. I was allowed down to the wharf for a little while and then taken to the cabin to sleep. I never learned why the celebration. I cannot remember the landing in Bombay or the three days passed in Singapore. Then came Hong Kong and lastly Shanghai.

I didn’t go to Vienna with a checklist. No Schönbrunn palace on the agenda. No museums lined up by hour. Just three slow-moving days, a waterproof camera backpack, and a promise to myself not to overthink it.
From the airport, I caught the 10.5€ bus to Westbahnhof and checked into a small guesthouse nearby. Quiet street. Solid sleep. Five-minute walk to most things that mattered.
I skipped the palaces and headed straight to a corner market for a mustard-soaked pretzel and a table with no view. I sat longer than I meant to. It was a good start.
I stumbled across the Musikverein just before noon. No grand performance, just a chamber rehearsal in the golden hall. I sat in the back. Stayed through most of it.
Across the square, the House of Music pulled me in by accident. I don’t usually do interactive museums, but this one surprised me. No pressure to move quickly. No crowds. Just quiet sound rooms layered like dreams.
Later, I caught the U-Bahn to Donauinsel, found a bench by the river, and watched the clouds shift. It started to rain lightly, but everything stayed dry — my gear, my layers — all tucked into that camera backpack I almost didn’t bring.
I walked aimlessly in the city centre, ducked into St. Peter’s Church, and followed the scent of coffee to K.u.K. Heiner. It felt more imperial than the cakes themselves — but the atmosphere was enough.
Dinner was at Neubauschenke: pork stew, beef broth, locals in padded vests. I sat near the back and scribbled some notes. Later, Papaya served me one of the better duck salads I’ve had in Europe. Spicy, fast, no English menu — perfect.
I didn’t plan this trip, and it still worked.
Because Vienna is good to people who walk slowly, who sit a little longer, and who carry light.
If you’re thinking of going, don’t overpack. A lightweight waterproof camera backpack will do. The rest, the city gives you.

You get used to it…
the lies
the hurt
the betrayal
the people abandoning you and not coming back.
You get used to it…
the people rolling their eyes when you talk about things that hurt you.
the grief
the pain
You being there for people and them not being there for you
You get used to it…
And then, when new people come along in your life, they say…
Why are you this way?
Why won’t you let me in?
Why are your boundaries so high?
Why are you so guarded?
and they get surprised when you just say…
LIFE
Life made me this way, and there’s no going back.

These days, I’ve been listening to some songs that boost my solitudes. I don’t know why but life more filled with peace and its own passion when we can deeply connected with small things around us. When we feel everything in a sense and deeply. Life turns out being way more meaningful rather than when we didn’t try to noticed small things and took it as a meaningless things. Lately, choosing to just slow down and trying not to be that ‘too ambitious’ for each steps of lives that surely stills unknown. I realized that it’s alright to not ‘rush’ everything at the same time. Not every single things supposed to be rushed.
One of Billy Joel’s song that can portray so much towards this writing is “Vienna”, and I’ve been listening to it on repeat. I tried to connect myself to the song entirely, turns out its that song that we all needed as a person who’s just entering early of adulthood. That it’s alright to disappear for awhile or as long as you want when things are seems so tough for you to carry on. That why don’t us try to slow down and just enjoy every little good things in our lives with passion and pride? What are we afraid for? As long as we can choose to slow down and take times to not rush each goals of our lives.
Choosing for ‘slow down’ or even ‘disappearing yourself’ from life stuffs won’t make you seems like you’re abandoning your life. Everyone’s timeline are different and you can’t afford things to be exactly same as what you’ve expected. Its okay when we knew other people’s timeline are way much better than us, but don’t take it as something that supposed to be rushed or being too ambitious over that until you forgot where your own life path were exactly at.
Take your time, smell the roses. You’re not in a competition.
Life will leads you to the finish line at its own right time. The timeline also won’t be exactly same like what you’ve imagined it to be. Because you never know what winds will drives you and where it’ll be. Growing old isn’t supposed to be that thing that rush you like you’re in a competition. Give yourself a chance to ask urself ‘what’s you’re hurry about?’. In the end, someday the life that you wished all this times will leads you slowly to its own place.
“Slow down you’re doing fineYou can’t be everything you want to be before your time”
Everything and everyone has its own timeline and you can’t decide your own timeline to be same like others. When others are better in their own timeline, then let them be. Someday your own body will take you wherever the place that you’re deserves to be. You can dream on over single things that you wanted, but also its good to least our expectation that not everything will come true. There some things that you’ve had planned yet it turns out didn’t happened like you wanted.
Just grab off your coffee, take a slow steps to daydream and rewind everything, remember what you have and where you are right now, and take a time to be grateful over it.
Growing old supposed to be when you enjoy every small things that you experienced and take of many appreciates for it. Take every joy of life that you have without have to rush yourself. Growing old are supposed to be when you understands that patience and timing are inseparable. Learn that growth will brings you to your own final destination when you’re just enjoy for being slow down without any fear of being left behind because you already know that your patience will deserves its own timing someday.
That every life journey will always represents passion, patience, and growth.

Slow down, you crazy childAnd take the phone off the hook and disappear for a whileIt’s all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, oohWhen will you realize Vienna waits for you?
I’ve first heard this song when i was 14, right before high school, and to be frank with you, i’ve always been an overachiever.
I thought that was the only way for me to be complimented and appreciated because i thought it was what they expected from me, like how they say ‘’their success was appreciated but mine was expected’’, so i’ve tried more and more and more until i burned out.
i mean, i thought my brain was programmed that way, get a good grade=get a prize, do something good=hear a compliment, it was all like that, till i started high school, the classes were harder and i found myself lost.
i remember the day i got a 50 for the first time, i was shattered, absolutely broken, and i thought my family lost their whole hope on me, i was making it bigger and BIGGER in my head, then i went home, i told my mom and…nothing happened.
this is my problem, making everything bigger in my head, this is a blessing and a curse, but mostly a curse, i also can’t trust people when they say something good about me, like i thought ‘’if my mom said ‘’it’s okay you’ll do better next time don’t be sad’’ that must mean ‘’you’re a failure go lock in and study until you get a good grade!’’ ‘’ so i did that.
and that worked.
for a while.
then i had..drumrolls…a burn out
then i’ve heard this song, vienna by billy joel, i can easily say it’s one of my all time favorite songs because it hits right in the feels.
when i’ve first listened to it, i thought vienna to be a literal place,
then i got older, at 17, i thought it was a place where you’ve felt happy and content, a metaphor
then i got a bit more older, at 19, now vienna means something else for me.
for me, vienna is a place where i don’t overthink..it’s a place where i can be ME, without worrying, without putting a mask on, just me, in my most naked and raw form.
all these intense, unhealthy nights spent studying and fake smiles being thrown in social gatherings, they’re not actually..me, they’s a facade i put to please other people, but when will i realize vienna waits for me?
i love studying, my education is perhaps the most important thing to me, but i don’t love ruining myself over it, no one would.
take the phone off the hook, and disappear for a while.
and that’s what i want to do, cleanse and refresh, just let the flow take me where i’m meant to be, because sometimes i think i know too much, but there are places that i haven’t been where i already belong, if i try to control everything around me too much, i’ll only sabotage myself.
and acting out in a place and around people where you’re supposed to feel comfortable is so draining and i just find myself doing this ‘derealization’ thingy, i just feel like a stranger to myself, to everything that’s surrounding me, i feel depressed, and i think;
who am i when i’m not performing for others, what is me, where i’m actually from, a land of over-thinkers, pageant queens and big pretenders?
nah, i’ll find a new place to be from.
maybe it’ll take me a month, maybe three, maybe six, maybe a year, pace is different for everyone but i’ll take the phone off the hook, and i will disappear for a while, just like billy joel said, i’m tired of social media making me obsesses over my identity in relation to others, i won’t let my soul rot inside me, because we only live once, so we should enjoy it, right?
if you’ve read it this far, thank you, love you, and just wanna say i’m here if you need a shoulder to lean on, thanks for bearing with my stupid ranting for 3 minutes.
until next time, take care, bye!

If you’re like me and haven’t lived in a locale with real seasons, I can attest — from my first experience in the late ’90s — that March in Vienna, Austria, is magical. I was born and raised in Southern California and before I had taken that particular overseas business trip, I had never experienced falling snow.
Sure, I’d driven up to the mountains and played in the snow, but that soft, bright, frozen tingle of perfection touching my skin? Nope, not ever — Not until my job as a managing editor for an international medical journal in 1999 flew me from LAX to Munich, and then from Munich to Vienna, to meet with gracious colleagues and helpful strangers, to schmooze and have fancy dinners, and do my job (of course).
After my first night in Vienna, enjoying a lavish dinner with editors and publishers, I walked with one of my favorite long-distance colleagues (hi, Ky!) back to our hotel. She’s from New York, and these trips were old hat for her. But for me, Vienna was the first place I’d been where scarves were considered a necessity and not an…

We all know that Billy Joel is a megastar, but some of his biggest hits came from dark places. In fact, he felt like a failed musician at times. In the early 70s, he was homeless, sleeping in laundromats, haunted by Vietnam and self-pity. After a failed suicide attempt, he checked himself into a mental hospital.
When Billy Joel wrote the song Vienna, he was 28 years old. This song is very interesting and means a lot to Joel because the lyric’s from this song is all of the advice his father gave him on his career.
“When will you realize Vienna waits for you?”
This hook explains to sit back and enjoy the ride. Your destination will be there when it's your time.
“Vienna” is a metaphor for old age, it’s not something to be afraid of, it’s something to embrace. “Vienna” is in the soft rock genre, written by himself to represent his life and of the pressure he put on himself. He understood that other people might be going through what he once did.
In this song, Vienna is about enjoying the ride before the destination. For Billy Joel, it’s about his music career and how much work he puts into it. The destination for him is all the people that listen to his songs and enjoy his work.
“Slow down, you’re doing fineYou can’t be everything you want to be before your time.”
With this line, Billy Joel is trying to spread the message that it’s ok to take a step back and take a breath, that it is ok to be wherever you’re at in life. He is telling his listeners to trust the process; the process got him where he is today. I can connect and relate to this line a lot and it helps keep me grounded. I also think most people could relate to this lyric, as humans tend to put a lot of pressure on themselves because we live in a toxic society that makes us feel like we have to be productive 24/7. This is also portrayed through the line, “Where’s the fire? What’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.” Everyone, yes, even famous and successful people can experience the feeling of being burnt out.
“You’re so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need”
Vienna is known as “the city of music” located in Austria. This is because it is home too many famous musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart’s. Billy Joel is reminding himself that he belongs with those extremely successful artists and he will join them in fame one day, it just will take time like all good things.
This song and the message that Joel is trying to deliver has been so successful because of his use of various musical components and elements. Having the ability to understand and properly use musical elements can help listeners grasp the message of a song.
The tone and volume of the song, along with powerful and inspiring lyrics help illustrate the underlying message. The tone is soft and inspiring. The volume or dynamics are gentle and calm, making listener feel motivated yet relaxed at the same time. The duration, also known as how long or short a sound is held, and the tempo, which is the speed, also helps deliver the message. This is because when Joel holds onto notes softly and slowly it emphasizes the importance of the lyric. Lastly, I think the overall melody of this song helps contribute to the motivational and inspiring message Joel wanted to share.
I think it is important for famous people to be vulnerable like this. It shows the more general population that everyone struggles in life, everyone needs to slow down at times and take a step back and that anyone, no matter the circumstances can have poor mental health. It is important to take care of ourselves and we as people see their idols and famous people opening up about their struggles but also then trying to fix them, it motivates others to do so as well.
It’s crazy how when you really dig into the lyrics and the past of the song writer, it can completely change your perspective on the song and the artist. After doing research on Billy Joel and his music I have gained a whole new level of respect for him. Not just for what he has been through but for his strength to share it and his ability to make good out of a bad situation.

A few insider tips for those heading to the Austrian capital
Vienna offers some of the greatest museums in the world. The positively stately Naturhistorisches Museum and Kunsthistorisches Museum face each other across a grand courtyard, and are neighboured by the MQ (Museumsquartier) which houses the Leopold Museum and MUMOK (Museum of Modern Art). These are all worth a visit. They are truly spectacular, and utterly world-class.
But a surprise treasure among these titans is the much smaller setup of the Mozarthaus. Here, on Domgasse, the great composer’s 18th-century apartment — and the rest of the building — have been restored and turned into a museum exploring the music, politics and personal life of Mozart. The museum is relatively small, but excellently put-together and (despite quite minimalist exhibition spaces) really very insightful. Particularly interesting is the information on Amadeus’ involvement in the Freemasons, which was new to me and showed a new side to his political and social interests.
In 1949, Vienna starred in what would come to be heralded as one of the greatest noir thrillers of all time — The Third Man. Based on the Graham Greene novel, the film is set in post-war Vienna and follows American Holly Martins, who arrives in the city to meet his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), only to find that he has been killed in a car ‘accident’. Martins grows increasingly suspicious that Harry’s death was not an accident at all, leading him on a road of discovery with a shocking twist.
Vienna’s Burg Kino cinema on Opernring is among the oldest cinemas in Europe (founded in 1912) and one of the only places in the world where you can still see The Third Man on the silver screen. Catch a Friday night viewing at 11pm in the cinema’s tiny ‘Studio’ screen and you can expect to be joined by no more than 10–15 others. Then, the next day, make sure you visit the Dritte Mann Museum (Third Man Museum, open Saturdays only) not far away, which tells the story of the film’s production — and the surrounding political context — in amazing detail. There are original posters from 20 countries, photographs, annotated scripts, cameras used in the film, and even the opportunity to see a short segment of the reel on a genuine 1930s cinema projector, complete with all the cracks, scratches and whirring. This — and the screening — were the highlight of my entire trip. Magical.
The Leopold Museum is one of the city’s most famous and popular museums, showcasing the height of Austrian art including works by Klimt and Egon Schiele. But in the museum’s lower floor, at time of writing, is a special exhibition on the visual art of famous novelist and poet Victor Hugo. Best known for Les Miserables, Hugo was not noted as a visual artist, and even dismissed his work as a trivial pastime in letters to his friends.
But the work is extraordinary.
Depicting horrific landscapes of death and destruction, human and supernatural evil, the violent ink and charcoal attacks on sepia paper are genuinely chilling. Some, such as the first image seen as you enter, of gallows standing in a bleak open pasture, are rooted in Hugo’s own defiance of the death penalty that was widely used by his nation during his lifetime. While Vienna is known for its classicism, these are little-advertised works of relatively contemporary art, and deeply emotive. Not to be missed.
Kaffee mit Sachertorte: Sachertorte is a must when you visit Vienna, and the temptation is to head straight to Cafe Sacher opposite the opera house where you will find a queue stretching out the door and service that feels fed up with tourism. Instead, try Cafe Mozart, an equally elegant traditional coffee house popular with musicians from the nearby Staatsoper and also where Graham Greene wrote The Third Man (see above). Great coffee, great cake.
Italian: Germany and Austria are reputed to have the best Italian restaurants outside of Italy, and there are many fine examples in Vienna. One such is the very unassuming Frascati pizzeria and gelateria at Barnabitengasse 3. Just off the ever-busy shopping street Mariahilfer Strasse, this cosy family-run place provides basic but delicious Italian meals at absolute bedrock prices. I enjoyed an enormous fresh Pizza Napoli and a large glass of wine for under €10.
Wienerschnitzel: Overrated in my view, but if you do want to try the city’s famous delicacy of deep-fried veal, you won’t do much better than Plachuttas Gasthaus zur Oper. Located close to the Opera House, the Gasthaus does a traditional Wienerschnitzel with potato salad for around €20 which is fairly standard across the city. If you’re going to do it, do it properly at an authentic Viennese Gasthaus. Don’t be tempted by non-veal alternatives (chicken, pork) at the city’s Greek, Italian and Turkish establishments.
It’s not exactly undiscovered, but perhaps underappreciated. Vienna is packed with amazing bars and clubs, but none quite have the atmosphere of the MQ. In all seasons, the central courtyard between the Leopold Museum and the MUMOK is a hub of activity. I visited in the winter months, and spent many evenings here enjoying a mug of Glühwein with hundreds of others — locals and tourists alike. Sometimes there are even live DJs or bands playing. I caught Austrian band Naked Cameo performing, joined by a youth dance group, see video below. This open-air space has an amazing atmosphere of unity and social openness about it, and should be your first stop on any bar crawl of the city, especially around Christmas time.
Vienna’s nightlife is, to say the least, elusive. I spent my week there trying to sniff out the club scene, researching online, to little avail. Eventually I reached my final night, and decided to give Volksgarten a punt and hope for the best. Located in the park of the same name (literally Peoples’ Garden), the club doesn’t look much from the outside. Surrounded by a metal fence, it has a Mediterranean look, open courtyards dotted with palm trees and high tables. The building itself is uninspiring. But head inside, and you won’t be disappointed. I dropped in around midnight on a November Saturday, their ‘Overground’ night, and the place was already starting to fill.
€13 entry seemed steep, but included a free drink at the very impressive cocktail bar. I actually got two stuck together. Bonus. The highly professional bartenders make a range of top-notch cocktails, and there’s also every spirit, beer and champagne to boot. Tables surround a central island of palm trees. Behind there, it wasn’t long before the dancefloor got bouncing. By 1am it was wild. The atmosphere electric. A man appeared with a bunch of balloons which he handed out to people. Periodically, the roof over the dancefloor would slide open like Thunderbirds, letting the soft rain fall on the ravers below. House thumped here, while it was hip-hop in another room through the back. If you want a party, head to Volksgarten. Highly recommended.

Semaj checked on me today as far as taking a rest day… I didn’t think I had been doing that much, and even said that a few days ago when I was wondering why I was so tired, but I guess I am. I want to ramp up to doing this much all the time, though. Especially now when I have all the time in the world.
I find myself getting off on the fact that somebody is worried about me. Kinda like back in college when I wasn’t eating enough — I wanted someone to notice and save me. Though that would always push me to continue whatever I was doing.
A lot of foods have been a struggle lately; not sure if it’s a problem with my appetite or a fear around foods. Eggs, for example, are so high in protein but have been making me nauseas to think about. Peanut butter toast & a glass of milk has been one of the foods that I can stomach, and while the macros aren’t great, it’s something… and I’ve had it for dinner multiple times this week.
Having scrambled eggs and cottage cheese as I write this, but I think it’s taking me being distracted with writing to be able to finish it.
Mozzarella cheese & smoothies are two other foods I can stomach right now, which I guess aren’t horrible, but I need more variety.
It’s a gloomy day but I have to go check on Moose and take him for a walk. Still counting it as a rest day though — my first one in 12 days.
Went to Stretch Lab for the first time – it’s nice just laying there and getting stretched out but the time went by too fast – and got told I have nice shoulders and biceps. That’s one I never get. Also partly why I’m overtraining right now: seeing results is addicting.
And in my defense, a lot of the time going to the gym gives me something to do.
I am so close to buying March flights to Europe…. Wouldn’t be my Dolomites trip, but do I trust this strong urge I have? Or am I being impulsive when I should be patient? Summer flights are sooo expensive right now though… I’m talking $1,500 expensive. And the thought of snowshoeing and/or being in the snow is oddly so appealing right now…
I really do think I’m going to find myself in Austria next month…
Do I just book a flight and figure it out like I did last time?

The moment one enters the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, there is an immediate sense of stepping into another era. This magnificent institution represents far more than a conventional museum — it stands as a veritable treasury of European history, art, and cultural heritage. For travelers planning a visit to Vienna with even a modest interest in artistic expression, historical artifacts, or architecturally impressive spaces, this museum merits priority status on any itinerary. Allow me to share my personal experience at this remarkable destination.
The Kunsthistorisches Museum enjoys a prime location in central Vienna, situated on Maria-Theresien-Platz, surrounded by other notable landmarks including the Natural History Museum and the historic Hofburg Palace.
Travelers utilizing public transportation will find the museum exceptionally accessible. The U-Bahn (subway) Line U3 provides service to Volkstheater Station, requiring only a brief walk thereafter. Additionally, tram lines 1, 2, D, and 71 offer stops at the nearby Burgring station. Vienna’s public transportation system operates with remarkable efficiency, ensuring straightforward navigation to this cultural destination.
The museum’s exterior alone warrants admiration, with its impressive architectural features including towering columns and intricate frescoed details that evoke the grandeur of a royal residence. Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a spectacular main staircase adorned with marble elements, gold accents, and artistic works by the renowned artists.
The institution houses an extraordinary collection featuring works by legendary masters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, Caravaggio, Vermeer, and Raphael. Hours pass effortlessly while exploring the galleries, captivated by the remarkable detail and emotional depth captured in these paintings. Enthusiasts of Renaissance and Baroque artistic movements will find themselves thoroughly enchanted by the extensive collections.
Peter Paul Rubens’ “The Four Continents” stands as a particularly impressive work — a grand, vibrant composition that commands attention through its dynamic movement and rich color palette. Equally compelling is Vermeer’s “The Art of Painting,” a masterpiece demonstrating exceptional handling of light and remarkable realism.
After several hours of artistic appreciation, the museum’s exquisite café offers a perfect respite. Located centrally within the building, this elegant space features high ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and the gentle accompaniment of classical music. The atmosphere transports visitors to a more refined historical period.
Culinary recommendations include the traditional Apfelstrudel (apple strudel) or the iconic Sachertorte (Vienna’s celebrated chocolate cake). Either pairs excellently with a classic Melange, Vienna’s sophisticated interpretation of a cappuccino. This opportunity to pause and savor refreshments reinforces that Vienna’s appeal extends beyond visual attractions to encompass moments of contemplative enjoyment.
A particularly memorable moment occurred in one of the less frequented galleries, standing alone before Caravaggio’s “David with the Head of Goliath.” The artist’s masterful manipulation of light and shadow to create dramatic effect and dimensional depth proved utterly captivating. In that moment, there emerged a profound connection — not merely to the artwork itself, but seemingly to the artist’s creative intention across centuries. Such experiences exemplify the transformative potential of cultural travel.
For those contemplating whether this museum warrants inclusion in their Viennese itinerary, the answer is unequivocally affirmative. Whether one possesses extensive art appreciation or simply enjoys architecturally significant spaces, this institution delivers an exceptional experience. From its remarkable structural design to its world-class art collection and charming café, every aspect contributes to a truly memorable visit.
When your travels bring you to Vienna, ensure that you allocate sufficient time for exploring the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Perhaps you, too, will find yourself captivated by the brushstrokes of a masterpiece, experiencing that singular connection between viewer and artistic genius that transcends time.

I recently moved to Vienna and I’ve been exploring this amazing city.
Schönbrunn Palace Garden
Today I walked over to the Schönbrunn Palace Garden. The palace was the summer residence of the Austrian emperors and at the time it was outside town. Now it is sort of on the edge of the city but squarely inside.
There are a million tourists that go there and it is not that cheap to get into see the palace itself.
BUT the main (huge) palace garden is free.
There are a couple of smaller gardens you have to pay to see but the main one has so much to offer. There are paths and fountains and buildings and benches and woods.
I had a wonderful walk around (and up, part of the garden is on a hill).
Walk where you are going
There is so much to see in Vienna and so many historical and wonderful buildings and houses. It is also a very walkable city.
Public transportation is excellent, but if you can walk to your destination. You will see so much on the way.

I look at life as a Richard Linklater film. It is mostly made of ordinary days. But on some days, unique connections and conversations make life exciting — that’s when you think life as an extraordinary gift.
Photo: The city of Vienna in Austria where Before Sunrise takes place.
Linklater has been trying to give life a meaning since the 1980s. Many consider Boyhood (2014), a film about growing up as his best work. No doubt it is a brilliant film, but for me, his best work is the ‘Before’ trilogy (1995–2013) collectively. The love story of an American man Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke and a French woman Celine, played by Julie Delpy spans decades and is so realistic and profound — that it seems magical. I know, what a paradoxical statement to make. What Jesse and Celine have is what we today call #CoupleGoals on social media. The story stands to the test of time. I can’t help but put the trilogy on top of the vast filmography Linklater has.
The three films Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013) are set in Vienna, Paris and Peloponnese respectively. Outside the trilogy, Jesse and Celine also briefly appear in Linklater’s animated feature Waking Life (2001).
Last summer, I travelled to Vienna and visited the record store in which Jesse and Celine get into the music booth and have a moment listening to the song Come Here by Kath Bloom. The 1:20 minutes scene contains melodious singing by Bloom with the following lyrics —
“There’s wind that blows in from the northAnd it says that loving takes this course
Come here, come here
No I’m not impossible to touchI have never wanted you so much
Come here, come here
Have I never laid down by your sideBaby, let’s forget about this pride
Come here, come here”
It is my favourite scene in the film. Yes, the scene with silence between the characters in the movie otherwise just made of naturalistic dialogues between the two characters. Linklater, with the help of Hawke and Delpy’s expressions, captures the awkwardness and wish for something to happen between the two young people about to fall in love so beautifully. The truthful nature of such moments is why the trilogy has such a dedicated fan base.
I was travelling across central Europe during the summer break, and I took a long bus ride from Berlin to Vienna. After checking out the main tourist attractions in the city, I decided to take the path of Jesse and Celine. I walked through Votive Church, Maria Theresa Monument and Albertina Terrace and in between, I stopped at Alt & Neu, the record store where the music booth scene was filmed.
The original German name for the store is Teuchtler Schallplattenhandlung u Antiquariat which means Teuchtler record store and antiquarian bookshop. Located at Windmühlgasse 10, the store has an extensive collection of vinyl records and music CDs. You will find all kinds of music in this store, from classical and jazz to rock and international pop. When I spoke to the store manager, he claimed it to be Vienna’s oldest second-hand vinyl store. I believed him.
Many of the store visitors are picture pilgrims like me who happen to visit the store not to see the vinyl collection but to see the place where Jesse and Celine connected. The store owners, of course, know this very well. They have decorated the insides of the store with many posters of Before Sunrise.
I spent about an hour at the store, going through records, listening to some tracks and talking to the manager. My favourite track listening was When I Fall In Love by Isaac Hayes.
I got the appeal of the place. It is a fabulous place to explore with a date (or even alone). I truly enjoyed my visit. For a film buff like me, it was worth all the efforts.
Previously, I had also visited several locations in Paris from the film’s sequel Before Sunset, for instance, Shakespeare & Company bookshop and Le Pure Cafe. Next, I want to visit Peloponnese where Before Midnight, the final film of the trilogy takes place. I am not in a hurry, though. Maybe I’ll wait till I meet my own Celine before I travel to Greece.
These films have helped me understand the importance of patience but also to believe in the magic of spontaneity. Applicable to both personal and professional lives. Thanks to the cinematic art of this kind, I often question my theories, behaviour and guiding principles of life. The humanism seen in Linklater’s films has also taught me about my right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to my own life.
There is a good chance you probably do not understand what I am trying to say in the last paragraph, but that’s ok. I encourage you to watch the films if you haven’t already, or read the screenplay if you prefer reading. In the end, to quote Celine from the film, “If there’s any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it’s almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.”
So please try watching these films and maybe we can have deep and meaningful conversations about the philosophy behind these films. I am sure our discussions will turn out magical, just like the trilogy.
Note: At the time of publication of this article, Medium does not pay me because its Partner Program is not available in India. Stripe, the financial service by which Medium pays to writers is still in the beta “preview” mode in the country. Hopefully, they will fix this soon, till then, if you enjoyed reading my article, please consider buying me a coffee here.

Vienna doesn’t rush. This is a place where royalty once ruled from golden halls, and thinkers spent entire afternoons debating ideas over a single cup of coffee. Somewhere between the chandeliers and the coffee stains, a rhythm emerged that still defines the city today.
It’s a city of elegant contradictions: regal but grounded, meticulous yet meandering. Here, rules are sacred but sometimes optional. Time stretches, conversations linger, and even the desserts have legal histories. Whether arriving for the palaces or the pastries, visitors quickly learn that Vienna moves at its own pace, blending place and feeling into something that stays with you long after you leave.
The Habsburg Show: Golden Eagles, Velvet Walls, and Questionable Genes
Before Vienna was known for psychoanalysis and cake disputes, it served as the nerve center of a dynasty that reshaped Europe through marriage. The Habsburgs mastered the art of strategic unions, creating a family tree dense enough to double as a political map and, occasionally, a medical case study.
Their architectural legacy still dominates central Vienna. The Hofburg Palace spans 59 acres and houses over 2,600 rooms. Schönbrunn, their summer residence, features 1,441 rooms and a garden maze that feels like a metaphor for their foreign policy. Even the stables come with marble trim and chandeliers.
Inside these palaces, daily life blurred the line between grandeur and obsession. Emperor Franz Joseph woke before dawn and bathed in cold water. His wife, Empress Elisabeth, maintained a famously intense beauty regimen and spent much of her life in motion, both physically and emotionally. She traveled constantly, rarely stayed in one place, and poured her melancholy into poetry. The Habsburg image lived in more than just portraits. It was rehearsed, refined, and woven into the fabric of an empire that placed as much value on appearances as it did on power.
Today, visitors can walk through their former apartments and still feel that curated presence. The symmetry, the silks, the gold-leaf accents,it all points to a worldview where order signaled control. The gift shops just offer it in magnet form.
Café Central once counted Leon Trotsky among its regulars. At the time, he was still a young political exile scribbling in notebooks, long before the Russian Revolution made him infamous. Legend has it he spent so many hours lingering over a single coffee, arguing politics, playing chess, and working on his writings, that the waitstaff stopped serving him. In a city where lingering is practically a lifestyle, getting cut off for loitering takes real commitment.
Vienna’s Coffeehouse Culture: Slow Sips, Big Ideas
Vienna’s coffeehouses offer more than caffeine, and somehow more than just a place to sit. They’re institutions with layers, equal parts habit, history, and human connection. They come with rules, rituals, and a kind of permission to simply stay still, creating spaces where regulars return and newcomers settle in without needing a reason. The most popular origin story credits a Polish officer with opening the first coffeehouse after the 1683 siege, using beans left behind by retreating Ottoman forces. Whether or not it happened that way, the myth fits the mood: resourceful, refined, and a little theatrical.
In these spaces, time doesn’t matter. Order a Melange, an Einspänner, or a Kleiner Brauner, and the table is yours for as long as you want it. The coffee might arrive quickly, but no one expects you to leave. Conversations unfold slowly. So do newspapers. Even silence feels purposeful.
Each café has its own personality:
Waiters in these establishments often operate with a unique formality. They may seem distant, but their precision is part of the ritual. It’s a dance between guest and host, where posture and tone matter as much as the coffee itself. And titles? Expect to be called “Herr Doktor” whether or not you’ve written a thesis.
Imperial Influence and Coffeehouse Ease
Vienna thrives in the space between polish and pause. The palaces taught a love for beauty and structure. The cafés nurtured the freedom to linger and think. Together, they shaped a city that respects both punctuality and wandering thoughts.
That balance shows up in the arts. Mozart composed operas while playing billiards between rehearsals. Beethoven was known to stomp through the streets, lost in thought, sketching music in his notebooks as he walked. Strauss wove elegance into movement, turning social gatherings into dance floors and salons into symphonic experiences.
Even Freud kept a predictable ritual: coffee, newspaper, walk, repeat. The city, in return, gave him a rhythm that worked well for analyzing the human condition.
The details of Vienna reflect this dual rhythm, with heavy curtains beside open windows, marble tables holding half-finished essays, and pianos tucked into quiet corners. A sense of ceremony that doesn’t feel forced, only natural.
Vienna Today: Living History Without the Velvet Ropes
Modern Vienna hasn’t frozen its past but instead has folded it into daily life. Historic buildings house galleries and offices. The MuseumsQuartier buzzes with energy inside former imperial stables. The Naschmarkt sells international street food steps from baroque facades. Tram stops are marked with ornate signage. Even the air feels curated.
Imperial palaces host everything from diplomatic receptions to startup events. Classical concerts are held under frescoed ceilings. Streets echo with street musicians and string quartets alike. The Ringstrasse still serves its original purpose: a grand promenade, open to all.
Even the cafés have adapted without losing their soul. New spots serve oat milk and Wi-Fi beside institutions that still deliver your water on a silver tray. The city updates itself with care, layering innovation over tradition without letting either disappear.
For visitors, this means options. A morning at the Hofburg can unfold into an afternoon of lingering with coffee that gradually becomes lunch. Attend an opera for the price of a sandwich. Walk the Ringstrasse with no destination, just curiosity. If there is a checklist here, it reads more like an invitation than an itinerary.
Quick Guide for Curious Travelers
Vienna doesn’t ask for urgency. It rewards attention. In a world chasing efficiency, this city invites you to take your time. And if that means a three-hour detour through a pastry case and a stack of newspapers, all the better.

I stared out into the void, or as much of the void as provided by the view of the upright and locked tray table in front of me, squished in the center row of seats on a trans-Atlantic flight after dinner and once the cabin lights had been dimmed for a precious few hours of sleep. I had left my wife home, alone, working on writing her dissertation in a city 3,000 miles away from where she was still a student, her patience and focus of typing and typing and typing from a corner in our apartment wearing thin, and my absence for these two weeks further straining our rather complicated living arrangements for the past year. We had lived apart on opposite coasts for four months, her finishing her Ph.D. and me starting a new job, though my flexible position afforded a visit every few weeks, and then she moved with me in the new year, but was far from her lab, her colleagues, and her advisor, so deadlines seemed to keep drifting for actually finishing and moving on. Nevertheless, she was excited for me to go to this conference, but deadlines for accepting invitations and planning had been months in the past, and as the departure date neared and the prospect of two weeks away became more real, some doubts began to arise if now was indeed the best time. Moments before we kissed goodbye on our apartment’s threshold, I had slipped the thin book into my backpack, something I had always been interested to read and was short enough I could finish it on the flight, but now, the closed book on my lap alone under my seat’s spotlight amongst a raft of snoring travelers, questioned the intelligence of bringing Camus’s L’Étranger.
One year into my post-doc, my personal research portfolio was beginning to slowly grow. Casting off projects assigned to me by my Ph.D. advisor had been relatively easy and something I had already done three years ago, in favor of a project I had started with a fellow student that had since taken on a life of its own. This co-student project tapped into a burgeoning subfield of particle physics whose inaugural yearly conference had actually taken place in an adjacent building to where my graduate school office was, and now only a few years along regularly had over 100 attendees and strong representation from all of the large experiments at the LHC. My first presentation on this project at this conference had been unique and impressed the community enough that the following winter, I had been offered multiple post-docs in the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, alone, accepting MIT as my intellectual home for the next three years. Essentially on my arrival to campus, I vowed to put aside those graduate school projects, to start something brand new, something original that would be indelibly identified as my own intellectual creation. This was, by contrast, not easy and progress on anything was slow, indirect, and sometimes frustratingly failure-prone, seeing the tiniest of light rays peeking through a hole only to calculate and calculate and calculate and realize that what you had been doing that whole time was not logically consistent.
The intellectual support and environment of the group at MIT at that time was definitely the most magical experience I have ever had and was perhaps the most special place to be in the entire world at the time for what I was doing. My post-doc advisor was merely two years into tenure track and publishing at a breakneck rate, his office across the narrow hallway from mine and stopped by each morning he arrived to chat about the new papers that appeared on the arXiv preprint server last night, or to see how a calculation was going, or to show me a mysterious and confusing plot that would then occupy my daydreams for the next several hours. His door was always open, and I returned the favor, dropping in unannounced numerous times throughout the day, to sit in his square high-walled pleather chair across from his desk, and at least puzzle over something together verbally, or one of us would walk over to his floor-to-ceiling blackboard to write an equation that we could then stare at in pensive silence. Each week, there were at least three topical seminars on particle physics to attend, in addition to the physics department colloquium, so everyone who was working on the great problems in the field were continually passing through, dispelling their wisdom in their formal talk, and then the truth would actually come out during the hosted dinner. There would have been no way that I could have learned what projects were interesting, useful, and impactful by merely sitting in my room all day, door closed, head down, hunched over my desk.
Two major ideas had been born in this environment and had correspondingly resulted in papers by the following spring. While both broadly addressed physics relevant for making predictions in particle collider experiment, they were otherwise relatively unrelated, which troubled me. At one level, they were obviously deeply connected, and I could imagine the first glimpses of nearly bottomless research potential if I could marry them successfully. Some conversations with others in the group at MIT had helped broaden my perspective, but something was still lacking. Another professor in the group had recently won funding through the Simons Foundation, the philanthropic arm of billionaire mathematician Jim Simons who left academia to found Renaissance Technologies, and helped organize a relaxed, discussion-focused workshop in Vienna, Austria, with a long-term collaborator and faculty at UWien. One was required to spend at least two weeks there, but, as members of the MIT group, Simons would be graciously covering our expenses, so saying yes was all too easy. This would be the place to have those conversations with global experts, to stare at equations on a board, to find and recruit new collaborators, or even to just convince the community that this was a question worth thinking about.
The Rathausplatz was converted into a summers-long festival setting, thousands of seats arranged in rows facing the city hall’s façade, itself covered with an enormous white curtain for the nightly film screenings, and then lining the promenade and spilling into the bounding park were dozens of food stands, serving a sampling of every cuisine imaginable, at least through Viennese interpretation. To ward off jet-lag for the night, I had walked the mile or so from my stifling greenhouse of a hotel room to observe the party, making a slight detour from the geodesic path to find the front door of the Institute and where my office for the next two weeks would be. The door was nondescript, but across the narrow gasse faced the US Embassy in Austria which, at the time anyway, had garnered minor celebrity status as the place that Edward Snowden would have been taken if he had actually been on the Bolivian president’s plane. Capturing a selfie with my laptop monitor’s camera, I then continued on, drawn along by the growing noise of the crowd and wafting smells of classics like pretzels, schnitzel, sausages, and kraut, truck-stop diner recreations of greasy burgers, fries, and a Coke, yeasty, malty lagers sloshed sloppily into masskrugs, and even ice cream carts offering the Vermonter staple of Ben & Jerry’s. For my first meal off the plane, I chose boldly, asking for ein burrito, bitte, with all the fillings, and over the counter it was passed, tucked snugly in foil and cradled it while moving over to a vacant standing table. It was stuffed to bursting with ground beef, black beans, corn kernels, something passing as sour cream, maybe some iceberg lettuce, and probably white rice and was perfectly, ideally, flawlessly flavorless.
Erwin Schrödinger, by some reckoning the inventor of quantum mechanics or at least of the equation that carries his name, posthumously leant his name to the Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics as the most famous scientist from Vienna. The ESI was founded about 20 years earlier as a place of contemplative retreat and intellectual stimulation, hosting workshops and conferences, programs and summer schools on anything related to mathematics or physics with a sufficiently defensible amount of mathematics in it. This month, the topic was of Jets and Quantum Fields for LHC and Future Colliders, a grand and sweeping enough name to justify its place there, but specific enough for essentially the entire world community of a couple hundred people whose research interests fit snugly under the title’s umbrella to be invited for a stay. From the front door labeled solely by a faded sign lacking capitalization, stairs rose steeply to the main hallway, where each step with any gait and with any shoe on the stone tile floor echoed off of the blackboards lining the wall and the marble bust of the namesake, and to the right was the door to the main seminar room, straight ahead to the toilets, and left, where I turned, to the workspaces. In the theme of promoting conversation and collaboration, any personal offices were basically non-existent, instead, broad, open rooms each with three or four desks, a bookshelf, and another wall of blackboards, and here, tucked in a corner with a view out the narrow window, I set down my backpack and settled in.
Coffee was slowly beginning to grow on me, and being in Europe, free coffee, and the socialization that a huddle around the carafe provides encouraged me to join in the conversations and introductions already in progress over sips and around blowing away the wisps of steam. However, as coffee is also wont to escape rather quickly, I excused myself for the bathrooms, around the corner, then through a swing door that didn’t quite shut completely, to the landing that lay in front of the couple of steps up to the row of stalls. With now a few trips to Europe behind me, the privacy afforded one in public toilets as compared to the half-door with both excess leg room and inch-wide gaps in the stall corners familiar in the US, was no longer surprising but had yet to cease to amaze. The toilets at the ESI were no exception, with hermetic, floor-to-ceiling doors and rubber weatherstripping in the jamb for a double layer of protection for each personal stall, and then inside, an immaculately clean head, several rolls of multi-ply toilet paper, and even a brush off to the side for clean up afterward. This all was more or less consistent with the standard I had now come to expect, but what elevated the experience to the heavens was that on the wall to my right was a blackboard with a few pieces of chalk on the ledge, so that there was no inconvenient time for inspiration. By the afternoon, once everyone had passed through at least once, the toilet boards were the talk of the coffee break.
The informal and unstructured nature of the workshop encouraged unfocused drifting from one’s desk, to spontaneous, interjected questions thrown out to the two or three office mates, to eavesdropping on the calculations or scratching of chalk on board that had floated over the low dividing wall. Sometimes the distraction would be intolerable enough that action was required, to set down your pen and walk over to stare directly at the mathematical expression that had already confused two others. My own discussions had encouraged a visitor, just a couple years my senior and someone I had worked with when I was an older undergraduate and he a younger graduate student, and I started again, to explain the baby steps of a calculation I was setting up to just begin to understand a toy example of a problem that had been sharpening in the past couple of years. He had also thought about some proto-cases and further had developed much of the necessary techniques to actually complete the calculation, so in my stilted explanation and terse, slanted board work, I eventually regurgitated all of my thoughts on the problem, and hints and suggestions for next steps were added by my my neighbor, who, at the same time, identified the leaps in logic that would need to be overcome. With nothing more to contribute now, he excused himself, and I sat back down in my chair, copying the boardwork into my notebook and returned to staring out the window, my mind racing in confusion.
Rather quickly, the groups and subgroups of us that had naturally divided up had relaxed to standard, comfortable dinner choices, initiated by whoever was first and most hungry and then, like a snowball, more and more of us capped our pens, closed our laptops, and zipped up our backpacks and set out. Each night, we would be flung to some other corner of Vienna, to either a biergarten out back of a pub, long wooden tables densely packed in a courtyard between brick buildings, open to the sky save the broad leaves of an ancient chestnut, or for schnitzel, though budgetary constraints restricted us to the schwine version and not the local delicacy Wiener variant with fried veal. Our beers drained as the sun set, and we would be on the move again, some ending the night and walking to their hotel rooms, and others such as myself, back to the Institute for a few more hours of work before a Skype call to the States and bed. Dark afforded a contemplative silence that was absent during the day, a chance to focus and distill and process the conversations into an equation or two to write on the board, left for tomorrow’s work. My walk home mostly followed the tram line north, away from the center of the city, tracks along the center of a wide boulevard, and just beyond a stop adjacent to towering pines to one side and flats on the other, I saw a badger waddle by across the deserted road, disappearing into the sodium-yellowed shrubs underneath the ground floor apartment windows.
Sprinkled throughout the unscheduled discussions and spontaneous meetings was a touch of regularity, with a few participants selected each week to present a talk during the morning’s coffee break. I was one of the lucky ones this week, and chose to discuss a recent paper I had published with my post-doc advisor on a strange and surprising feature we had identified in the process of performing calculations for predictions of physics that would be observed at the LHC. Ample time was allotted with the suggestion that a small fraction would be for presentation and a larger fraction for the inevitable arguments that would and should arise in any good and sufficiently controversial talk. So, standing in front of the rows of green sliding chalkboards, I kept my goals limited, pledging some motivation verbally for why the calculation was interesting and that, naively at least, should make no sense whatsoever. Perhaps the thing that was hardest for the audience to grasp was its simplicity, as all I did next was calculate the area of a couple of triangles, relate that to the probability of observing a particle, and then with a swish of my hand to push a board up, revealed the turn on the final board. I had hidden nothing, every step had been completely transparent and obviously next in the logical series, but the prestige was that from the answer, there was no going backward, there was no way to return to the start again as the process had washed away the footprints in the sand. Complaints and whataboutisms rained from a pair of people seated in the back row, this was just some special case, what if more realistic effects were included, and I initially tried to respond but was soon drowned out by rebuttals from the other side of the room and piling on from the front, and silently gained a renewed determination to understand this better.
Lunches went typically like this: as a junior colleague of the organizer from MIT, I was among those regularly selected for a meal off campus, at some favorite place of the organizer from UWien. Our cohort, relatively small and some days even small enough to fit comfortably at a four-top, would head out following our local guide and arrive at the restaurant that was, midday and midweek, almost always otherwise deserted. If today’s group was on the larger size, a crowd-pleasing menu and long booths were called for, but a small group could sit outside at a bit fancier place and a favorite returned to a few times during my stay was informally referred to as the French academy, not because of the style of cuisine, but because of its proximity to an immersion school. We would enter through a door that opened to a garden or park, tables set under the cooling shade of beeches, and request free Leitungswasser while the younger of the group chose a beer and the elder a Clausthaler, lest a full stomach and the heat of a summer’s afternoon lull them to sleep. Physics specifically was rarely the topic of conversation, a mere hour’s break during the whole day, but instead recommendations for Viennese entertainment, places to travel on the weekend, or the state of regional politics were discussed. At the request Zahlen, bitte the organizer from MIT would always wave off my attempts at pulling out my wallet, as Simons would be covering lunch.
Another evening saw me back in the Institute after dinner, the sun having long since set, back again writing at the blackboard, pacing to and fro, or just staring at it seated at the edge of my desk, hypnotized, thoughts unfocused and hazy, tumbling around in my brain but going nowhere. A cursory glance at my watch revealed that a respectable time for departure was long in the past, so I gathered my things and hurried down the stairs and out the door, walking at a brisk pace on the radiating pavement through the finally-cooled night air. This night was no busier than previous, I was still all alone on the tram track street’s sidewalk, though behind I could hear a car speeding up and then passing me, its illuminated scarlet tail lights and rooflight fading as it turned a corner ahead. Though it had seemed to be in a great hurry, once I had turned that corner, there the car was, parked, hazard lights blinking, and the driver’s door open and just off the sidewalk, at those same bushes into which that badger had waddled, I could make out the silhouette of a person, standing slightly hunched facing away from their car, legs astride of some invisible saddle, with the unmistakable sound of drizzling water. My hotel would be on the other side anyway, so I thought this as good a place as any to cross the street.
As with several times since I left, this Skype call had turned silent, staring, longing for each other, lonely and confined in 800 square feet with just blank pages of her thesis glowing from her screen. I could tell her about the food I’ve eaten, or the research projects that I had made progress on, or the baroque architecture of palaces and cathedrals and museums, or that opera is piped into the public bathrooms of the Wiener Staatsoper, but it made the chasm deeper, the rift wider. I was here surrounded by everyone in my field, days filled with busy lunches and talks and gossip with coffee and felt more alone, more that I was faking, putting on a face and acting to be excited by what I was doing around a hollow inside missing that part that inspired and motivated. Now long after midnight here and dinnertime there, I had to saw goodbye and a weak, resigned goodbye was echoed, miss yous exchanged, and with a kiss closed my laptop. The still air had done little to cool the room through the cracked window, so all I could do was lie in the dark on the springy double bed, a few inches too short for me so my feet hung over the edge, and stare at the ceiling until exhaustion succumbed to sleep.
I had scoped out a nice five mile loop for a morning run through a combination of MapMyRun and Google Maps that would take me north, away from the city center to quieter neighborhoods that hugged the base of the grapevined hills, and had woke early with plenty of time to enjoy the crisp morning before the sun had aroused the ground from its slumber and into its humid, hazy hypnopompic state. A few turns into the run, I had reached a waypoint, running adjacent to a stream, and jumped into and off of the road as the width of the cobbled sidewalk waxed and waned. Next, I should turn right at a major intersection, but the name of that street had dissolved from my memory, so I had to trust that my subconscious had internalized the route and would just tell my feet the way. My legs formed no such divining rod, however, and I was left to guessing, and this right seemed as good as I could expect, so away I went. I had not noticed that my path north had drifted significantly west to become nearly parallel itself with the base of the hills, so a right turn started gaining elevation and the road I was on shrunk and shrunk, rather unlike the behavior of major thoroughfares, and soon I was on a one-lane path, the shoulder overgrown with brambles, and that transformed abruptly into a flight of concrete stairs once the pitch had become too steep. Now certain I had missed my turn, I nevertheless beat on, with a certainty that a right turn would appear and transport me back to the familiar.
Enough right turns had eventually bore me back east, but not before gaining more and more and more elevation, the trees and brush had thinned down to tightly trimmed grass, and I had reached the pot-holed farm road that orbited the summit. Just higher now was the farmhouse, but I turned away, and there below lay all of Vienna, filling my view but silent, the sounds of the city waking up had not yet permeated to these heights. An emerald carpet of stringed vines rolled down and away, and stretched to the base of the hill into which the blanket of trees was tucked, quilted with the alleys and streets and avenues and boulevards. The majestic Danube, broad and blue, cut the western bank and drew the eye along a line southeast into the heart of Vienna, to just where the domes of palaces and spires of cathedrals peeked above the apartment rooftops. Farther yet, the haze had already started its morning meal, making its slow march north, devouring buildings and roads and leaving behind a formless, milky nothingness. This sight soon required a more and more extreme twisting back while running forward, but then mercifully the path cut steeply down and into the darkened forest, growing broader as tributaries rejoined until its delta spilled into that street I had missed, now almost an hour ago.
I never had graduate students of my own, as a post-doc one is not presented with such a responsible distraction, and then later, teaching at a liberal arts college, there were simply no graduate students to be had, though still plenty of overeager undergraduates desiring to do research. By now, the problem had sharpened, the goals defined, and I knew what needed to be done, but I couldn’t do it alone. One collaborator was natural, a fellow post-doc at MIT with an expertise in precision calculations that could ensure that the edifice was sound, through whom I could learn and whose hammer would complement my strength of identification of the right and most interesting nail to strike first. We had shared some notes back and forth on the initial framing of the problem and some preliminary calculations and in doing so, isolated the remaining issue: we needed one more person in this collaboration to do all of the calculations. The organizer from MIT had a couple of graduate students just starting their third years, the time when, finally, graduate students become useful, and give to a project more than the effort of teaching and hand-holding takes from an advisor. I asked about one student who I knew and had chatted with a bit this week, but he was already engaged in a huge, open-ended, multi-year effort to extend results first published in 2010, and with no clear deadline on the horizon, whose time was completely filled. However, the organizer’s other student had no such prior engagements and further was new to the whole theoretical physics business, having made the extremely rare and nearly practically impossible jump from admission as an experimentalist but qualified to Ph.D. candidacy as a theorist, so was in need of a project on which to cut their teeth. So, after lunch one day, I had my first conversation with the student who came the closest to being my only graduate advisee.
Theoretical physicists publish papers throughout graduate school and because we don’t use that time to construct an experiment and analyze data, a theoretical physics Ph.D. thesis is usually little more than a collection of these papers, and all that needs to be written at the eleventh hour of the graduation deadline is a short but sweeping introduction to tie them together. To do this requires really no more than a couple of papers, and a successful student that correspondingly fields a couple of post-doc offers may have half a dozen or so, and I myself had seven published papers in graduate school of which I chose three to highlight for my moderate 116-page thesis. Then there are off-scale students, with well more than 10 highly-regarded papers published in graduate school and theses that require the better half of a ream to print, and this effort and accomplishment never goes unnoticed. By 3 years in the future, this student, my student, had published eight papers with me of his 14 total, stapled the three most influential into a 500 page thesis, which was subsequently awarded the prize for the most outstanding original research in theoretical particle physics in the country. During the winter of his final year, on the awkward 9 month lead time prior-to-job academic schedule, he was sorting through an embarrassment of post-doc offers from each of the top eight places to do particle physics (exclusive of his graduate institution), and then a few years later, joined the faculty at an Ivy League. Globally, my part in all of this was tiny, my letters of recommendation were strong, yes, but they could say no more than what was already there in his papers, but I hold tight to whatever little influence I had as my most proud academic achievement. And it all started with a mere nudge, a suggestion, to meet with this student.
From the front door, stairs led down, into the cellar of the 12 Apostles, tables spread throughout the centuries-old vaulted cavern hewn into the rock, then bricked over, the various parts of barrels augmenting the medieval aesthetic. The ambiance was by far the most intriguing aspect of tonight’s dinner, with the beer and the goulash merely passable, but our group of graduate students and post-docs maintained lively conversation, reflecting on the week or two since arriving. Someone at the table suggested dessert, and even only ok apfelstrudel à la mode is still apfelstrudel à la mode, so soon a symphony of spoons were clicking on the ceramic plates, but in parallel, others were pulling out Euros and doing some quick estimates of their required share. As we were about to hail a waiter, the coda from another table ended and fiddler and accordionist stalked their next prey, but we were as helpless as sitting ducks, midweek and late, late at night already so few other tables were occupied, they pounced and for some reason picked me off, planted to my left and right. I was stuck, I couldn’t push my chair back because the fiddler’s bow hand trapped me in, and the threatening, smug wise-guy face of the accordionist scared me into a smile, thin and emotionless, but stretched beyond the edges of my nose enough that I could fake enjoying it. The worst part was yet to come, as once the music stopped, they lingered, and the longer they lingered the greater the guilt, and a few at our table passed a Euro or two their way, but I was able to drop my glance, avoiding eye contact, and didn’t look again until ascending the stairs, the musicians’ backs to us, ambushing another table.
Of our dining diaspora, I alone walked northwest toward my hotel, past the darkened door of the Institute, and then connected back with that tram-line street, long since deserted but made somewhat hospitable every block or so where the warm amber glow poured down from the excited sodium vapor above. Where the road ascended slightly here now was that corner, nudged right by the ancient, stoic tree, and, unlike previous nights, all was too quiet so my consciousness was lost somewhere in my thoughts and memories and dreams. I didn’t see the car with its headlights off idling ahead, creeping in its lane as I continued to step unconsciously forward, I didn’t hear the passenger’s window roll down, nor did I notice the muzzle that just peeked out of it, but the stream that hit my chest, the howling, cackling laughter erupting in the night, and the revving engine and squealing tires jolted me into the present, and all I could manage to coax out of my throat was “Hey!”, though any audience was already a block behind me and moving away fast. My shirt was drenched, I had been sprayed by a water gun from about 5 yards, a perfect bullseye hit from that would-be sniper, and, though late, the heat had never really receded even after the sun had set, but I was now refreshed and cooler, and a smile grew across my face along with a couple of head shakes and chuckles. I suffered no bodily harm and could change my shirt back in my hotel, but at least it wasn’t cat pee.
The train lurched forward, the snaps running down its length like the crest of a wave as coach couplings tightened, and we accelerated first in shadow and then in the morning’s glinting sunlight once out of the station. My day had started hours earlier, rising with the sun to eat a quick breakfast of accumulated snacks, then to stuff my camera, more of the snacks and a water bottle in my pack, and then to walk the four miles or so from far north to far south across the city, through familiar streets to the Institute and then onto the Rathaus, and then veering right off the Ring, through a posh neighborhood adjacent to the Belvedere and thick with embassies and consulates representing countries throughout the world. I had had the spontaneous idea that, given my current proximity and that I was unlikely to travel to eastern Europe very often, I should take this opportunity and a train to the capital city of some neighboring country, and had rather randomly selected Hungary and Budapest as my destination. I dozed off and on, as much as the upright molded plastic second-class seat and an elbow on the window sill would allow, but was awakened around the stop at Györ by a ticket check. A few seats in front of me was a complicated discussion in Hungarian between conductors and a newly boarded passenger, with passports out and open, more conductors arriving from the front or rear, exchanging words, and then rushing on to consult someone or something in a far away cabin. The terminus of this train was Budapest and we had already started on again and though I knew no Hungarian, it seemed like the passenger with a conductor or two hovering over for the duration of the ride had not paid, but there was nothing to be done until we decelerated and the couplings slacked and again rang out.
Over the next six hours, I walked down the boulevards of Pest, past the birthplace of Theodor Herzl just a few blocks from the train station, across the Chain Bridge and up the hills of Buda, taking in the view and panoramic pictures of the Danube, the spires of the parliament building and the technicolor tiled rooftops that lie below, circling the top of the hill, from the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene, its façade riddled with bullet holes seated in the bombed stone plaza to the courtyard of Buda Castle up to the Fountain to King Matthias and the open-air excavation of an ancient, ruined church. Down I went, crossing the Chain Bridge back to Pest, and turned upriver toward the parliament building, but paused at the abandoned, empty iron Shoes on the Danube Bank and then with my back to the river, headed inland, arriving at St. Stephen’s Basilica as a newly married couple first exited the open doors in a rising, drifting halo of iridescent soap bubbles and then descended the steps, surrounded by clapping and cheering friends and family, and where I snuck to the side entrance to climb to the balcony for a view back to Buda. This entire time, I was never tempted to enter a restaurant for lunch and only stopped in one shop on the ramrod-straight Andrássy Avenue, a ceramics store where I found a cute mug on which a frazzled cat was painted, and once enough tissue paper surrounded and cradled it, gently tucked it in my pack, and marched on, a mile further due northeast and entered the City Park at Heroes Square, greeted by the bronzed Seven Chieftains of the Magyars.
Time until my train was now running short, so I turned from Városliget to walk the few blocks back to the train station. I kept my feet moving while I slung my camera and backpack from my shoulder in one move, unzipping the pack to tuck the camera in, but in doing so obscured the view of anything directly in front of me on the sidewalk, and just as the camera slid in, bang went my knee and up went a scream from below. I had inadvertently kneed a child, by their size, no more than four years old, thankfully not hard enough to get hurt or fall, but sudden enough to get startled. Louder came the screams and tears erupted from the child’s eyes, and I asked in vain in English about “Mom” or “home”, but the response was only more pathetic sniffles. The sidewalk was far from deserted but no one stopped, and it even seemed that they avoided me and this child, sped up their gait, or turned their gaze away, as if we and the air around us carried some sort of infectious curse. Still no one came to the aid of this child, no one acknowledged the child’s whimpers, and as moments stretched to minutes, a panicked sweat dripped from my temples as anything I was doing was in vain, neither calming nor raising the faintest sympathy from strangers, so I left him there and continued to the train station, and at the next crosswalk looked back, but no sound was to be heard, nothing for the crowds to evade, the child had vanished.

In May 2017, my wife and I visited Vienna en route to a different location. That destination is unimportant for this story where we got to spend a number of days in this magical city.
Since we got to the city early in the day, we had a few hours to kill before we could access our apartment near the Augarten Park. Just steps away from the metro station was the Stadtpark, the City park.
By the time we got to the western edge of the park, it was time for us to have a simple lunch. The park had been filled with statues, fountains, and more flowers than could be imagined.
I had picked up a city map at the Metro station and plotted the walk to reach our apartment. Once we parked our backpacks in the apartment, we went for a walk to Augarten park which was nearby.

“My dream writing room would be the Imperial Library in Vienna.” Fran Lebowitz
The word “cosy” means different things to different people. For some, it’s sipping a cup of chai in the comfort of home. For others, it’s watching your favorite series without interruptions. It might be talking to friends or family about something meaningful, or spending quality time with loved ones. In other words, it’s that moment when you’re truly yourself — when you’re not bound by any obligation, when you’re quietly loving yourself, and when you’re living, not just existing.
I try to find these cosy moments in my home, and today that moment came while painting a memory from Vienna. The art is far from perfect and still incomplete. The art is inspired from a church which was across our apartment in Vienna. I snapped a photo, thinking that one day I might paint it. Today, I finally did. When you visit a city, you carry it with you forever and Vienna is that city for me. Isn’t is beautiful you need not pay money to be an artist or a writer. Your own memories are enough. All you need is a pen and a paper and you keep doing it again and again as if that’s how you will attain salvation.
I’ll take my time with this. Watercolor isn’t my favorite medium, but I will try to do my best to paint the memory.
February Weeds & Wildflowers Writing Prompt is Cosy. Sharing today’s memory for the same. Thanks to the editors of Weeds and Wildflowers publication for the space for my rambling.

Vienna is a thriving cultural hub with beautiful architecture and fascinating history. It was also named the “World’s Most Livable City” by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).
That’s why I recently packed my bags and moved to Vienna. I wanted to see if the city lived up to the hype. And sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.
Here are my first impressions of Vienna:
While wandering the streets of Vienna, a street food stall caught my eye. I decided I would try some traditional Austrian food. Not knowing a lot of German or Austrian cuisine, I pointed to what I thought looked tasty.
“Käsekrainer” the man said.
“Danke schön (Thank you),” I replied.
He handed me a plate with the largest sausage I had ever seen in my life, cut up into small pieces. Then, he gave me a slice of bread and some ketchup on the side.

Vienna ooo nah nah, half of our heart is in Vienna ooo nah nah. 🎵
Leaving Santorini was an event — the airport was not built to support multiple departing flights and has the worst airport logistics we’ve ever seen in our lives! In short, it was chaotic, people were shoving, kids were crying, there was yelling and no space or direction to where you should go… so when we landed in Vienna… it was the most incredible thing.
It was silent, organized, we could flush toilet paper (!!! we didn’t know Greece has poor plumbing…) we had McDonalds following Maeghan’s goal to eat it in every country we visit, we downloaded our fav podcasts (and Maeghan has a cameo in one!!), and facetimed family from a bus(!!!!) with real wifi and saw our family in full-resolution… no more pixelated heads :D
And that was all just in the first 30 mins of being here, this city got even better after that.
We explored the beautiful buildings, the meaningful history and ate / drank the best things. Vienna is pretty awesome and we will definitely come back.
See more on our website www.alittledetour.ca🌏✈️👫
Sisi of Bavaria was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary who had this building constructed for her and her husband to live in with plans to build an identical building across the way. She was sadly assassinated (by accident!) in 1898 and her husband stopped construction due to a broken heart.
Later in history, this Imperial Palace was used by Adolf Hitler to perform his famous speech, proclaiming Austria as part of the Third Reich.
And today, all the buildings are in such great shape… looking back, I think the Parthenon in Greece may have looked similar to this one back in the day 😃
Meet Claire 👋 she is an incredible woman we had the pleasure of meeting (by eaves-dropping and totally striking a cool Canadian conversation… 😊). She is an opera singer who is studying her masters in Austria. She shared a few hours with us talking about her work, some challenges and the philosophies she lives by as she trains to as a Opera singer. It was such an inspiring conversation. Claire had such a love/passion for Opera, so much so, that she wanted to share with us and gave us two free tickets to a show!!!
We ended up going our last night in Vienna, and it was pure magic.
So there’s a thing in Vienna, where you can go see the Opera with standing tickets. They only cost 3 euros!

Are there still fireworks in a famously quiet, central residential area in Austria’s capital?
New Year’s Eve in Vienna used to sound like being thrown into a war zone — a staccato of explosions with sound volume close to or above the pain threshold for hours and hours and hours … But those days are gone. Over the last few years, the change of years became relatively silent in Austria’s capital. Officially, the main reason is that Vienna has forbidden all pyrotechnics above class F1 (anything children are legally allowed to use) within city borders. Further, supermarkets no longer sell fireworks, citizens are more concerned about the environmental and climate impact, and dog owners (Austrians cherish their furry family members) have become more vocal.
This is especially true for my residential area — the Nordbahnhofviertel. This rather new part of the city, although very central, is quiet as can be. It is traffic-calmed, has many driving bans, and sometimes you get the impression that there are more cargo bikes than cars. And, predominantly inhabited by young families, it is not a party hotspot by far.
Anyway, even there, fireworks and firecrackers still exist, and people either love or hate them. Depending on the side, the reported noise quantification fluctuates between Animal Crossing and Call of Duty scenarios. Unsatisfying as this is, I have decided to put a little more data into this discussion.
I have used the mobile app Night Hark to measure the sound volume during the night and to detect the sound of fireworks/firecrackers. Therefore, I have placed an iPhone 8 next to the closed window in my apartment on the third floor and let it record the night. I put it into my home office room with closed doors, so there might be some noise contamination from my family and me, but it shouldn’t be too bad. After all, I can code there without being disturbed by my kids playing Ninja in the living room shouting the name of Jutsus.
I will report the sound volume in decibels full scale. Since mobile phones use digital microphones, one only gets the sound pressure level relative to the maximum signal capacity of the microphone (= 0 dbfs). I don’t know how much that is for an iPhone, but my best guess would be to put it somewhere close to 100 dB. The app would also return an A-filtered measure, which is tuned to the hearing spectrum of humans, but since this is at least partly about animals and I have no clue if A-filtered would be appropriate, I stick with dbfs (if you know more about this, please let me know in the comments).
Before we get to the results, a last help for interpreting them: Loudness is not linear. An increase of 10 dB corresponds to a perceived doubling of loudness. So 60 dB is double as loud as 50 dB.
We can see in Fig. 1, which displays the max sound pressure level per minute, that there is a build-up till midnight when loudness jumps to its max value and stays there for around half an hour before ebbing down. During the build-up there seem to be two local maxima at around 19:00 and 21:00 — maybe those were fireworks for very small and small children who cannot stay awake till midnight. After 2 o’clock, it is practically quiet.
Further, the scale was never maxed out with 0 dbfs, so the phone could have been able to quantify even louder sounds. The loudest minute was 0:32 with -17.8 dbfs. If my guess of a max value of 100 dB is correct, this would correspond to 82.3 dB, or for reference, a motorcycle or a crying baby. Not quiet, but only an eighth of the loudness of a disco at 110 dB or a 32nd of the pain threshold at 130 dB.
Honing in on fireworks and firecrackers, I looked at the count of either fireworks or explosion classifications with a score greater or equal to .05. (Night Hark uses YAMNet, a neural network, that can classify sound snippets of 0.975 seconds into 500+ categories. Each sound category gets a score between 0 and 1, with greater values indicating a higher likelihood that the snippet belongs to the specific category). Since the sound behind the window is somewhat muffled and the time resolution is limited, this is no 1:1 representation of the actual number of bangs, but the proportions between time-frames should be valid.
In Fig. 2, we can again see a clear peak at midnight, a local maximum at 20:30, and a hard stop at 02:00.
Whether this is a lot or quasi-nothing lies in the ear of the listener, but I am sure this is comparatively silent for New Year’s Eve in a metropolis. I am interested in your experiences and thoughts on that, so please let me know in the comments.
If you want to look at the data, you can find it here.
Night Hark, the app I have used for the sound measurements, is available on iOS and Android.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year — yet advent is even more wonderful in certain locations.
Out of all the cities I’ve been to, and I’ve visited quite a lot in the last fifteen years, Vienna is by far the best place to be in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
Not only because of the food (even though it plays a vital role!) but also because of the traditions celebrated and the visual, glittery makeover of the city.
Here are six reasons why Vienna should be the travel destination of your choice for next December (if Corona allows).
Advent markets exist in many countries, but in Austria, they’re definitely the most beautiful! From small and rural to big and shiny — everyone will find a market to his or her liking.
More than twenty markets grow out of the concrete in Austria’s capital alone during November.
The most famous (and touristic one) is probably in front of the Vienna City Hall with over 100 booths. Another very popular one is situated in front of the Imperial Palace Schönbrunn.
But, why are they the best in the world? Surely, not only because of the locations? No, they have far more to offer.
Delicious food, yummy hot drinks, and arts and handcraft are sold here. For me, this is one of the most important aspects of a proper Christmas market.
I’ve been to markets in London, Paris, and Amsterdam but they all couldn’t keep up with the markets at home. They were far too posh and overdone, with a lot of tech stuff for sale, instead of traditional workmanship.
I prefer browsing through wooden stalls in soft lights, which display self-made candles, hand-made jewelry, knitted hoods, and gloves as well as or local delicacies.
I prefer to hear soft Christmas music instead of loud radio hits.
For one month only, I enjoy a life that doesn’t circulate around high-tech equipment and being the loudest.
Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas in Austria, without our markets, where vintage and traditional last-minute presents can be discovered.
Giant snowflakes hanging between Baroque buildings, illuminated trees guiding cars through the streets of the inner district, fairy lights shining from balconies and through windows in every other apartment.
It begins to look a lot like Christmas when the lights are switched on in the entire city.
White. Blue. Green. Red. Lila. In all shapes and forms.
There is nothing more magical than walking through the streets during December. Even getting stuck in a traffic jam feels less frustrating when shiny snowmen and glittering snowflakes guide your way.
In the shopping streets, every other shop plays Christmas music too. What a wonderful world …
The scent of roasted Maroni (chestnuts), fatty Langos, and Glühwein (mulled wine) stream through the streets like the wind.
Street booths that sell these chestnuts and potatoes pop up in every corner, giving our popular ‘Würstelstände’ a very hard time.
Yet, the culinary hot spots during advent are definitely the Christmas markets.
The choice of punch is overwhelming: Orange Punsch, Berry Punsch, Pina Colada Punsch, Jagatee, Eierlikör Punsch (egg nog), Tequila Punsch, Ginger Punsch, Elderflower Punsch, white and red Glühwein, and much more.
A perfect display of the multi-cultural heritage of this country.
You can visit every Christmas market in Vienna and still won’t be through all the flavors. Trust me, I tried!
The same is true for the food. You can start with a warming bread soup, continue with gratinated toasts or potatoes, taste some Krautfleckerl or Käsekrainer and finish with a cinnamon-drizzled Baumkuchen, chocolate-stuffed Krapfen, or chocolate-coated fruits.
The best part for me is always the tasting around. Many small, often family-owned businesses book a booth and bring their own products.
Just yesterday I tried the yummiest truffle-parmesan bread spread and a nice locally produced Gin.
No wonder my family and I always gain five kilos over December.
This is one of the most widespread Christmas customs in German-speaking Europe. You’ll find at least one of these decorative pieces in every family’s living room.
The advent wreath is made out of pine branches, which are weaved into a circle. It’s then decorated with small Christmas balls, wooden figurines, ribbons, or whatever you want to put onto it.
Four big candles are placed in the wreath, to be ignited one at a time on every advent Sunday while we sing carols, read verses from a Christmas story (or from the Bible), and eat homemade cookies. And drink some more Punsch.
The custom goes back to the 19th century, where Johann Hinrich Wichern placed 20 lights on a broken wheel. Over the years, the size and number of candles were reduced to their current form.
The tradition of Nikolo and Krampus remains one of the most cherished in Austria. It’s living folklore that has survived until today, and sparks joy and fear in the hearts of children.
Every year on the 5th of December, Austrian children position cookies, milk, and a pair of shoes by the entrance door or window to give the Nikolo energy for his travel through the country.
As a thank you, he leaves sweets in their footwear.
Then, on 6th December, St. Nikolaus visits Austrian homes and kindergartens in full bishop’s robe to assess if the children have been good or bad.
But he usually doesn’t travel alone — children must be aware of his servant, Krampus! Krampus is the complete opposite of the saint: a terrifying, horned, hoofed, and furry figure.
While Nikolo brings sweets and chocolate to the brave children, Krampus brings warnings (in earlier times also strokes) to the not-so-brave ones.
This tradition, especially the Krampus, is still very popular with adults, who like to dress up and walk the streets to frighten people.
So you better be good for one year, before you travel to Austria!
Vienna is not only known for the beautiful Christmas markets and classic music but also for its people and their grumpy-ness and Viennese ‘Schmäh’.
We have no patience, we get easily annoyed and we’re not too shy to let everybody around us know, even nice tourists.
But, when everything around us starts to glitter and shine, and when our sharp mind is lulled in by Punsch and mulled wine, our nerves get soothed and our heart grows bigger.
We forget to be grumpy and annoyed and can even be nice. So advent is the best time to meet Austrian people and make new friendships.
If that isn’t a Christmas miracle, what is?

Vienna has a register for its trees. I learned this through my favourite crowd-sourcing app, iNaturalist. It allows identifying surrounding plants and animals by simply making a picture and uploading it through the app. A community of fellow users and iNaturalist algorithms suggest possible identifications.
I was scrolling on my way to give a talk but I still had some time, so I went into a park to observe some Viennese urban wildlife. One of my observations was a tree (probably poplar).
The observation is registered in iNaturalist as observation #22987310. Not long after uploading the images to iNaturalist I got the feedback that I should have listed the observation as a cultivated tree. “My” tree was apparently planted and it is 45 years old and has the tree registry number 30.
It is these kinds of interactions and data linkages, that makes me love iNaturalist and its community.

Discovering the History and Culture of Austria
Vienna, the imperial capital of Austria, is a city of striking contrasts. With its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant cultural scene, it’s no wonder that it has become a top destination for travelers from around the world. In this article, we will take you on a journey through the wonder of Vienna, exploring its history, culture, and beauty.
Vienna’s history stretches back over 2,000 years, and the city is steeped in rich culture and tradition. From the Habsburg dynasty to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Vienna has played an important role in shaping European history. Visitors can explore this history by visiting landmarks such as Schönbrunn Palace, the former summer residence of the Habsburgs, or the Hofburg Palace, the winter residence of the Austrian emperors.
The architecture of Vienna is equally impressive, with stunning examples of Baroque, Gothic, and Art Nouveau styles. The city’s main cathedral, St. Stephen’s, is a beautiful example of Gothic architecture, while the Belvedere Palace is a masterpiece of Baroque design. The Jugendstil style, known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe, is also prominent in Vienna, with many buildings featuring decorative facades and intricate ironwork.
Vienna is also renowned for its music and cultural scene. The city was home to famous composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Strauss, and visitors can explore their legacies by visiting places such as the Vienna State Opera or attending a classical concert at the Musikverein. Vienna is also home to a vibrant contemporary arts scene, with galleries and museums showcasing both established and up-and-coming artists.
Foodies will find plenty to love in Vienna as well, with its rich culinary traditions and world-renowned coffee culture. From the famous Sachertorte chocolate cake to hearty traditional dishes such as Wiener Schnitzel, Vienna is a city that is sure to please the palate. And of course, no visit to Vienna would be complete without a visit to one of its many traditional coffeehouses, where visitors can relax and soak up the city’s atmosphere.
Beyond the city itself, Vienna is surrounded by stunning natural beauty, with the Austrian Alps just a short distance away. Visitors can take day trips to picturesque towns such as Hallstatt or explore the nearby vineyards and sample some of Austria’s world-famous wines.
When planning a trip to Vienna, there are a few must-see sights and experiences that should be at the top of any traveler’s list. First and foremost, a visit to Schönbrunn Palace is a must. This stunning palace, with its beautifully landscaped gardens, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers visitors a glimpse into the lives of the Habsburgs.
Another must-see attraction is St. Stephen’s Cathedral, the city’s main cathedral and one of the most impressive examples of Gothic architecture in Europe. Visitors can climb to the top of the cathedral for a stunning view over the city.
For those interested in the arts, a visit to the Belvedere Palace is highly recommended. This stunning Baroque palace houses one of the world’s most important collections of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
Finally, no visit to Vienna would be complete without a visit to one of the city’s traditional coffeehouses. These atmospheric cafes, such as Café Central or Demel, offer a taste of old-world Vienna and are a great place to relax and people-watch.
Vienna is considered one of Europe’s most beautiful and culturally rich cities for good reason. From its stunning architecture and world-class museums to its vibrant music scene and famous coffeehouses, there is no shortage of things to see and do in this historic city. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply someone who enjoys the finer things in life, Vienna is sure to captivate and inspire you. So why not plan a trip to this magical city and experience its wonder for yourself?

Throwback To 2020: Life In Vienna During The Initial Days Of The COVID-19 Pandemic,https://palarkaprabha.medium.com/throwback-to-2020-life-in-vienna-during-the-initial-days-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-a2dfe7fdd017,"Sign up

Read the Bangla version of this article that was published on Unish Kuri.
It was a reasonably chilly February afternoon when I first caught the attention of the sudden rise of COVID 19 cases in Europe as I made my way back home from a fine art event in one of the quintessential Viennese red and white trams. Most of these cases were overwhelmingly being reported from Italy and Spain. Like any other layperson, my initial reactions were a concoction of wishful reasoning, indifference, slight concern, and ignorance. I continued to plan and work on all the assignments and deadlines I had for the upcoming spring and summer months. My attitude was hinging towards being carefree and believing that the virus was “just another flu” with probably slightly more severe symptoms.
However, within a matter of one week, as the number of infected people and the death toll began to rise just across the border in Italy, I finally grasped the reality of the situation and realized that it was just a matter of days before Vienna and other neighboring cities in Central Europe faced the same crisis. By the beginning of the second week of March, Austria started recording many new cases of infection daily, and I had to cancel all my plans for the upcoming months immediately without second thoughts. I started educating myself rigorously on this coronavirus to avoid unwanted panic through misinformation and fake news and arm myself to the teeth in case of the worst. Living halfway across the globe from my family in Kharagpur, it was pretty challenging to fathom and accept this unprecedented crisis and the sweeping changes it would bring in the future, both at a personal and community level.
Austria decided to go into a complete lockdown on 16th March, as the healthcare systems in Italy and Spain were put to the test for the first time since the Second World War. The number of infections rapidly rose across the European Union, prompting the WHO to declare Europe the pandemic’s epicenter. For the first time in my life, I felt completely exposed to a severe crisis, a feeling which I had only imagined partially or grasped by reading newspaper articles on wars and calamities. There was a great hustle on the days leading up to the lockdown in Vienna, with people hoarding food, medical, and other essential supplies like toilet paper and sanitizers. I, too, had to rush to multiple stores and secure basic supplies as not enough guidelines were available in English in the initial days. There was an eerie feeling that it was the silence before the storm- an impending natural disaster or war-like aggression. The government was swift to tackle this problem within a matter of days by ensuring smooth and unhindered supplies and providing detailed information in English to the expatriate community on their official website.
The quarantine days have been very stressful for me like billions of others around the globe, worrying about the human cost of this pandemic, possible shapes and forms of the job market for young graduates like myself, and their long-term psychological impact. Amidst all this negativity, the only silver lining from my quarantine has been the rediscovery of latent interests I have had, ranging from cooking various meals to experimenting with various forms of sketching. I humbly acknowledge my privilege to be able to indulge in these activities. An interesting observation arising out of being locked in the same apartment building for weeks together in this period has been the growing sense of belonging to this city and my neighborhood, which I never felt before as a foreign student. It is a life-long bond that I will carry into my old age.
The strict lockdown measures were relaxed earlier this week, and further restrictions would be lifted by the end of April. Being the first country in Europe to flatten the curve, the authorities in Austria aim to put the country back into much-needed economic normalcy by the middle of May. It seems for the moment that the initial cannonball has been dodged as deafening silence and apocalyptic scenes of deserted streets continue to loom large over the breakfast servings of apple tarts and melange coffee in Vienna. If the current levels of precautions and alertness are not maintained, the virus might regain strength again and cause another wave of casualties. The historian in me hopes that the city will overcome this dark chapter like it repeatedly did in the past in the events of the Mongol threats, the Ottoman sieges, the Spanish Flu pandemic, and the horrors leading up to and during the Second World War. And I cannot help but wonder how in these days of fighting the coronavirus, Mozart would have composed a string quartet, Klimt would have painted, and Freud would have psychoanalyzed his patients

It’s been a while since my last blog! I’ve been taking some time to reflect on my summer, spend time with family and friends and have been swamped with Givesie and participating as a vendor at many local Portland events during the last few months.
But I am back this week and wanted to share with you my amazing trip to Europe this summer! I got the chance to visit Vienna, Austria and Zurich and Lucerne, Switzerland with my parents. It was by far one of the best experiences of my life! And to be able to share those memories with my mom and dad is priceless.
Vienna has this richness in history and architecture; the museums, the palaces, the statues, the cathedrals and gardens are breathtakingly beautiful and so intricate in detail! One of my favorite sights to see was the St. Stephan’s Cathedral, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna and the current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, which was completed in the year 1160. It is the most important religious building in Vienna, “has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city’s most recognizable symbols.” Walking inside I was immediately in awe of the stunning, yet dark and dramatic beauty of the interior. Words could not describe the sense of peace, calm and excitement I felt all at once walking through.
The Schonbrunn Palace is one of the busiest tourist sites to see in Vienna. It is a neoclassical style palace and was built during the reign of empress Maria Theresa and was also the home of Franz Joseph, the longest-reigning emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, along with his wife Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria. I loved touring through this palace, it was decorated exactly how it would have looked when it was first built. I felt like I had gone back in time, envisioning what it would have been like to be alive and living during the 18th/19th centuries.
Another one of my favorite places to visit was the Belvedere Palace. Consisting of two Baroque palaces, the Upper and Lower and set in the Baroque park landscape and the Belvedere garden, it houses the Belvedere museum. Walking through the museum I was surrounded by the most stunning pieces of historical art done by some of the most famous artists from around the world and from centuries ago! Definitely a sight to see!
As we wrapped up our tour of the museum we worked up an appetite — so, mom, dad and I had to stop at the cutest little café on the palace grounds for a late afternoon latte and pastry! So. Good.
After our amazing time in Vienna, we were off to Zurich and Lucerne, both are beautiful cities surrounded by stunning mountain ranges, lakes and charming medieval towns.
The train ride my parents and I took from Vienna to Zurich was probably one of my most favorite parts of the trip! It was an eight hour ride, but felt so much shorter! We had such a great time chatting, taking pictures, eating delicious meals, passing by and stopping through small towns, seeing the gorgeous mountainous scenery and huge lakes and rivers. We spent just a few days in Zurich, seeing Old Town, browsing through local boutique shops, shopping for souvenirs, as well as taking a day trip to Lucerne along with a boat ride on the lake. Even though it was a short time — it was absolutely perfect! I remember sitting outside this adorable French outdoor cafe by the lake and enjoying an afternoon espresso with my parents, while people watching — and thinking to myself — I can’t believe I am actually here and enjoying this beautiful moment with my mom and dad that I will cherish forever.
This trip gave me such perspective and such an appreciation for travel and exploration! Being in a new environment, new people, new culture. There is such a big world out there to see and experience. We tend to get caught up in our normal routines, the everyday tasks, work, etc…and tend to forget that there is so much to appreciate in life! Sometimes you just have to get out of your comfort zone and your norm to be able to see things in a new light. xx

A city that reminds me
Of a town,
Vienna,
The one with cool winds
And cooler heads.
On a Sunday,
Everyone gets a break,
The city shuts down,
As if on a curfew.
No shoppers or eaters
Roaming on the streets,
All establishments shut
And everyone stays home.
For an outsider
Vienna seems forlorn,
Like their city did during the lockdown.
But for insiders,
It is a paradise
As they enjoy time with family
At home.
Even on a Monday,
There is no hurry,
No running behind a bus or a train
No speed walking down the pathways.
Those going to the office or school,
Stroll at their pace,
Enjoying the winds
And the sun,
And their coffee in breaks.
They work at their pace
Enjoying the task at hand,
Undisturbed by the distractions,
As if in a mystic flow.
They cycle, calm and slow,
Not in a hurry to reach their destination
For them, the journey
Seems to be their destination.
Not formal wear,
No big cars or big frills
Just them in their shorts and ts
Going about their day
Like it’s a treat.
Living their lives
In a pause,
They teach me
How to take a break,
And learn how to walk slow,
To enjoy every moment,
Whether on vacation,
Or at work.
They teach me
To lessen my agendas
To leave behind the past
And let the future rest
To be in the present,
In this here and now.
I learn to sit still,
Immerse myself in the now,
Enjoy my surroundings,
And the words I read;
Stopping for a coffee
Every now and then.

Like Atlas, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, wait staff in Vienna take their job very, very seriously.
Vienna: the capital of Austria, home of the Hasburg dynasty, old architecture and tardy, poker faced, sarcastic wait staff.
In one of Europe’s oldest cities, with a long and rich cultural history, and a reputation as one of the world’s centres of art and learning, the wait staff rule supreme. Long waits for service, being ignored and a general attitude of low level irritation that you want to be a customer seems to be the norm.
Ancient architecture = posh attitude
One travel brochure (The Free Map For Young and Clever People) proclaims that in Vienna, “The waiter is king. Don’t be surprised if the waiters are unfriendly - not the guest is king, he is. Treat him as your superior and he will reward you.” The brochure also claims that “waiters NEVER smile” and that for tipping “5-10% of the bill is the amount the king expects from his subjects.”
The advice in The Free Map for Young And Clever People is ridiculously honest and self-deprecating.
To begin with you are annoyed and maybe offended by this behaviour. But, after a few experiences you realise that it’s not actually you personally the waiter hates, it’s everybody – perhaps it’s a persona they all adopt as part of their profession or as a survival tactic against drunk and obnoxious tourists who don’t speak German.
My personal experiences of this phenomenon were being told I had ordered children’s beer when choosing a 330ml sized glass (normal serving size in my country) instead of a ½ litre. My bad. Another was overhearing the same waiter yell at a patron asking them if they wanted to see a menu. Theoretically, this sounds like he was being helpful and doing his job. However, in person, his tone, body language and glare revealed the true nature of his passive aggressive overture. What he actually said nonverbally was “buy something to eat or f**K off”.
When your office is this plush you might be forgiven for developing an arrogant attitude.
A further experience was when buying a Kaserkrainer (vienesse hotdog) from a street vendor in the early hours of the morning. The vendor must have been earning significantly less than the barman and really needed the customers, but felt the need to finish his entire cigarette before deining to serve us. He then spent less time than it took to smoke it heating a sausage on the grill, before wrapping it and throwing it on the counter for me to collect. The patience we were expected to show while waiting was not reciprocal. While we fumbled uncoordinated and inebriated for the correct change, his bloodshot eyes glared with annoyance. How dare we bother him to prepare his advertised victuals and deign to give him a few euros for his disgruntled efforts.
This attitude is strange considering that you want to spend your money at the establishment where said wait staff are employed. You might think they would be welcoming of a tourist who wants to donate them money. You may highlight the link between your custom and their wages – but you would be wrong. The waiter just has no f**ks to give about you and your desires to eat or drink or be treated like a human being.
“Let them eat cake” - Marie Antionette was a Hasburg and probably developed the attitude that cost her life while growing up in Vienna.
Sometimes this apathy worked in our favour. For example, when the bus driver was in danger of having to do something untoward, such as turn in his seat, converse with you and maybe issue you a ticket. Instead, it was easier for him to just lift his eyes, wave his hand dismissively towards the general direction of the back of the bus and grunt something. We interpreted this as there would be no charge, but it may have meant - “I just don’t give a s**t.” I doubt he would have come to our defence if an undercover ticket check had taken place.
Advice for ‘Acting like a local' — “Be Grumpy”
The Free Map for Young and Clever People makes an effort to explain why the Viennesse hate on life. Under the heading ‘Act like a Local’ it was suggested that you “be grumpy”. Supposedly, it is “mandatory” for “original Vienesse to complain if the bus is one minute late or the weather is too hot/cold/wet/sunny. This “mentality” (general bad attitude) was justified as being part of the rich Vienesse culture and is based on hundreds of years of historical precedent and practice.
Back in the day (16-18th Centuries), Vienna was the home of the Hasburg Dynasty and the centre of several empires. As such it was a center of commerce, education, construction etc, and developed a large bureaucracy which served the monarchy and employed half the population of the city. Everybody knows that a high standard of living, steady employment and job security suck, so it is understandable that these unlucky civil servants developed a negative attitude.
Members of the Hasburg dynasty pretty much ruled most of Europe in the 16th - 18th centuries
According to the Free Map for Young and Clever People this explains why wait staff, and more generally everyone (especially if they had an ancestor who worked for the government) has the historical right to be grumpy, rude or generally a dick.
Other historical facts from the Free Map include how after WWII “all the Nazis miraculously disappear and the population suffers a collective loss of memory as far as the last 7 years are concerned.”
This appeal to history is obviously a bullsh**t excuse to act like a jerk. More likely, people being people, they could not leave their work at work and the hierarchal structure of a feudal bureaucracy permeated into their attitudes and behaviour outside of their jobs. Add a mix of simian tribalism or pack behaviour and next thing everyone is looking down their noses at anyone else their social standing allows them to – and treating them accordingly.
What is mystifying is that in contemporary Vienna, a city where the Arts and Humanities are cultivated, this is a standard of behaviour that some aspire to. Or perhaps it’s as simple as:
“If you don’t like a person, it’s because they remind you of something you don’t like about yourself.” — Sigmund Freud, father of modern psychology and resident of Vienna, before being forced to fleeing prior to WWII.

A Captivating Train Journey Through Stunning Landscapes From Vienna to Munich,https://travelsimplygo.medium.com/a-captivating-train-journey-through-stunning-landscapes-from-vienna-to-munich-a50e60777015,"Sign up

I decided to ditch the flight mode this time and chose to travel by train for the remainder of my Europe tour. This was the last leg of my 20-day Europe trip, and I had booked train tickets from Vienna to Munich in advance. Yes, it was a great decision.
I had traveled by train in Europe before on several other trips and the experience was stupendous. Notable among them -
Paris to Interlaken in Switzerland
Within Switzerland most of the travel I undertook by train
London to Edinburgh
Rome to Venice
Each form of transport has its advantages and disadvantages. Having different types of travel experiences is worthwhile and we must try them all. It is Fun !!
While trains have a charm of their own, one of the drawbacks is that you have to take care of your luggage and stack them in their proper place. Unlike a flight where your luggage is checked in and taken care of soon after you arrive, making you feel relaxed and free.
On the other hand, to catch a flight, you have to reach the airport at least two hours in advance and go through security, etc, while traveling by train does not involve any of these processes. Hence it is hassle-free and time-saving.
An additional reward of train travel is that you get to enjoy the bewitching countryside views.
Another benefit of train travel is that it is cheaper compared to flights.
Staying in the Ibis hotel directly opposite the railway station in Vienna was so convenient. Firstly, it was a great place to have your meals at the elaborate food court inside the station building. Similar to what we have at malls or airports, you could choose from a wide variety of cuisines.
Secondly, boarding my train to Munich was a breeze. All I had to do was cross the street and within minutes I was at the train station. Though I had the tickets downloaded on my phone, due to unfamiliar language, the platform and the seat numbers were not clear. As such a day prior to my departure, I went and clarified at the information kiosk. The result was that on the travel day everything was smooth sailing.
The railways have done a fantastic job of making train travel incredibly easy and comfortable. I really appreciate the presence of glass waiting lounges (similar to the one at Vienna) at railway stations — a protection for passengers against harsh weather conditions.
Absorbing the last glimpse of the splendors of Vienna, as the train left the platform, the view from the window transformed into staggeringly pretty vistas. The four-and-a-half-hour journey was filled with picture postcard scenery as the high-speed train traversed through verdant countryside landscapes, charming villages, with their cute cottages and historical landmarks.
Amongst the several stoppages en route was the historic town of Salzburg. It was on my bucket list, but was unable to visit. I was quite tempted to get down there and explore, but since there wasn’t any plan or reservations done, so skipped.
In the previous train journeys food was included, and I enjoyed the luxury of being served warm, delicious food and drinks in the cozy comforts of high-speed trains. The in-between snacks were a surprise perk and a great pass time.
This time though the pantry car and availability of food was a let down. Most of the hot, fresh food and beverages were over. There were very limited options left, that too of packaged snacks, that I don’t prefer.
I was craving for a hot chocolate drink and that was over. Something that I relish immensely, not just for its creamy, lip-smacking taste but also the fact that it aided in keeping me warm from the cold weather. Had to settle for the insipid, tasteless tea instead!
It didn’t even seem as if I was traveling from one country to another in Europe, except on crossing the border from Austria to Germany, when uniformed border police personnel were there inside the train for passport checking. I didn’t know about it, luckily had my passports in my handbag and not packed in the suitcase.
From the numerous connecting flights that I took, this was a different experience. A desirable change, rather than flitting in and out of airports. Holidaying at a slow, relaxed pace, that lifted my spirits.

Words by Boris Fishman and Alex HalberstadtPhotographs by Francesca Catastini
THE SLATE-COLORED JANUARY MORNING drummed cold rain against the windows of Café Prückel. My friend Boris and I had arrived on the red-eye from JFK two hours before. He wanted to sleep; I wanted to go to Prückel, and he’d reluctantly agreed.
Vienna is renowned for its cafés. There’s the toothache-inducing gilt of Café Central, the faux-bohemian shabbiness of Café Hawelka, the raspberry-bordello color scheme of Café Sacher. But my first destination in Vienna is always Café Prückel. Like the more central cafés, it, too, is overseen by taciturn middle-aged men in poly-blend tuxedos. (Viennese servers do not subsist on tips, a fact reflected in their unhurried gait and refreshing disinclination to smile.) But it’s more spacious and sparsely populated, always making me feel pleasurably left alone. Multilingual newspapers hang along the walls, and soft-boiled eggs arrive in eggcups alongside good espresso, and the light streaming in through tall windows invites you to dig your shoulders into the upholstery and linger.
Across the table, Boris didn’t seem to share my enthusiasm. But it wasn’t because I’d kept him from a soft mattress. “It’s like a Soviet cafeteria,” he said, poking unhappily at the cold cuts that had arrived along with the eggs. He surveyed the vast dining area, which, admittedly, did have a wood-paneled wall or two. “The bourgeois version.” I suspected that this was partly why I loved it.
I first came to Vienna when I was 9, a refugee fleeing the Soviet Union. My mother, her parents, and I shared a rundown hotel suite somewhere on the city’s edge. It was the first stop on the journey that would eventually take us to New York, and Vienna was our first encounter with what everyone in the Soviet Union referred to, usually in a whisper, as the West.
Beginning in the late ’60s, hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking refugees passed through Vienna on their way west, mainly to Israel and the United States. Concerned about the appearance of losing so many citizens, Soviet officials preferred to release their refugees to an intermediary nation — and its neutrality made Austria a logical choice. I suppose what I remember most about those weeks in 1979 is a peculiar mixture of emotions: sheer confusion; exhilarated discovery; the distinct embarrassment of being a stranger in what felt like a more civilized civilization; and the recent loss of everything and everyone familiar save a handful of loved ones, a presentiment cushioned for me by the fact of my childhood.
But my most indelible memories of Vienna were of café interiors, especially the vitrines filled with pristine geometric pastries that looked to us like they were made by Fabergé — they were all the more compelling because, subsisting on an allowance from a refugee-resettlement agency, we couldn’t afford to taste them. Now, decades later, I could — and did, an architectural piece of strudel surrounded by a moat of vanilla sauce. I was finishing a book about three generations of my family and wanted to find some vestige of our passage, and of my former self. On this, my fifth visit to Vienna in ten years, I wanted to know one more thing: Why did the city pull me to itself so relentlessly?
JANUARY IN VIENNA: I should have known better. But if Alex had proposed the Sahel in August, I probably would have said yes, too. In Alex, I’d finally met, after 29 relatively barren American years, what felt like a doppelgänger. He had experienced the same immigration I had, ten years earlier; it had left him with similar complexes; and he had the same degree of separation from his Russianness and Jewishness that I did.
And I was curious about Vienna. It was where my family and I encountered the West in 1988, when I was 9. No one had told me where we were going or why, but the signs weren’t good. In the months before leaving, as we pawned everything in our apartment and whittled a century in Minsk into one suitcase per person, my sweet, sheltered Soviet life gave way to unspecified terror. (Ordinary people didn’t travel outside the Soviet Union, and those who did certainly never got to return.) On the rail platform of the train to Vienna — it was easier to imagine visiting Mars — my mother wept as if someone had died. Soviet customs had just upended our suitcases and treated itself to my mother’s wedding ring and a set of gold cutlery. My neck burned with a gold necklace concealed under the top button.
Thirty-six hours later, we rolled into a kind of fairy tale. Even poor people seemed to drive Mercedeses. The supermarkets had automatic sliding doors, which my father learned after nearly toppling an emerging Austrian grandma. I gorged on bratwurst oozing with bergkäse cheese and ice cream cylinders wrapped at the ends with striped twine. In this country, the sausages melted like ice cream, and the ice cream came wrapped at the ends like cured sausage! Once, I came across a kitchenware store so beautiful that, my mouth agape, I walked right into the window, my forehead leaving a spot on the glass. We might as well have been rural North Koreans trying to defect to Ibiza. (At our medical checkups, the doctor handed us a diagram that explained that my mother had to consume the pills for her earache orally, not by putting them in her ear, as previous immigrants had been doing in deference to the Soviet habit of treating earaches with ear compresses.) But Vienna — Vienna would do.
Since immigrating, as I Americanized, then de-Americanized to reconnect with my heritage, then pureed both parts of myself into a thoroughly imperfect but more or less livable hash, I thought of Vienna now and then, the way you wonder about what might have been with someone had the timing been better. In places like Austria, I imagined, they didn’t worship “freedom” to the point of anarchy; were less ready to sacrifice morality for profit; did not regard intellectuals with suspicion; and took care of artists — took care of people in general. Alex felt a deeper attachment to our adopted homeland. It was the one part of him that mystified me.
Thirty years earlier, a small number of refugees like us had found a way to remain in Vienna. “What are you all stampeding over there for?” one, named Sasha, kept asking us. He meant America, a word that to us meant more than Shangri-la. Sasha had visited Brooklyn, where we were heading. “What’s it like?” my mother asked. “It’s not like anything,” he said. When we finally encountered it two months later — low-slung, dirty, and gray — we remembered his words. What if I’d spent the last three decades in Vienna, instead? But there’s the fantasy and the cold, gray, wood-paneled truth.
MY FIRST MEMORY OF VIENNA begins aboard an Aeroflot jet, its fuselage painted with a winged hammer and sickle. My mother and I left Moscow in our winter coats, carrying two suitcases containing six changes of clothes, a photo album, and a book of poems by Anna Akhmatova. My mother’s wedding ring and watch were taken in customs. Aboard the plane we were served an unexpectedly luxurious meal of baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and a wedge of soft processed cheese in a foil wrapper that read “Progress!” I remember my mother slipping the metal forks and knives into her coat pockets. An hour into the flight the pilot announced, in German and then in Russian, that the plane had left Soviet airspace. “Meine Damen und Herren…,” the announcement began, and when it was finished one or two passengers, the boldest ones, clapped. At the airport in Vienna, I sat on my suitcase and gaped at a security guard with a German shepherd and a submachine gun. Then I watched a pilot walk out of the gate, his hat embroidered with the six-pointed star of Israel. “Is Austria a capitalist country?” I asked my mother. She said I looked “as scared as a rabbit.”
To revisit a place remembered from childhood is to realize two rather disappointing facts: (1) Most of us recall childhood through a filter of adult sentimentality, and (2) our memories are, at best, undependable — researchers have found that every time we mentally access a memory, our recall of it changes. We confabulate others unwittingly, with a clear conscience. And the more I thought about my weeks in Vienna in the fall of 1979, the more I had to admit that two things had occupied nearly all of my 9-year-old brain: non-Soviet makes of automobiles and eating. Luckily, my interest in cars has waned, but eating remains a preoccupation. The Viennese are preoccupied with it, too, though without the Parisian self-regard or Roman chauvinism.
As in other cities with thriving café cultures, Vienna’s cafés and bars are cognizant of themselves primarily as social spaces. Most are laid out with watching — and being watched — in mind. Some are as flamboyant as stage sets, but all seem attuned to the public pleasures of tribal togetherness or the kind of low-effort nonconformism that sometimes involves an omelet.
Zum Schwarzen Kameel, where Beethoven had emptied a great many cases of red wine, was celebrating its 400th anniversary, and after a long nap to kill jet lag, Boris and I pulled up two hard barstools in its front room. Popular with maximally groomed, rather cruel-looking regulars — it’s a hangout for conservative politicians — it encourages competitive levels of smoking, which remains permitted in restaurants, another vestige of my Soviet past. Kameel is home to one of the country’s most thorough wine cellars and possibly the most rewarding people-watching in town. Boris and I spent a night there drinking cold Grüner Veltliner, happily lost in talk, while men in quilted jackets and creased trousers crowded around the bar, jockeying for another glass of wine. The only solitary figure was an enervated young woman wearing a fox-fur waistcoat and a Chanel bag sitting across from us. She looked like someone had stood her up. She kept her vividly mascaraed eyes fixed in the middle distance and, with jeweled fingers wrapped around her glass, exhaled drafts of smoke in our faces.
I HAD GIVEN ALEX PRÜCKEL, so he agreed to give me “Swimming Pool.” In Mitteleuropa, when it comes to fitness, yoga and spin classes are still the interlopers, and bath complexes the standard. But we didn’t go to the century-old Jörgerbad pool, in the sleepy 17th district, to take the healing waters. I wanted to see whether the comparative generosity of the Austrian state meant better art. For there was going to be art at the pool, commissioned by the nonprofit arts group Brut, a mainstay of the avant-garde scene in Vienna. A performance artist and several confederates were going to use the pool to “expos[e] the audience to the conflicting feelings of safety and uncanniness.” Whatever that meant.
After some horsing around in the pool, the actors went off to perform various oddities. One poured what looked like red food dye into the pool gutter, making me think of chemical attacks and the extreme generosity of Austrian arts funding. (Alex deemed it “quixotic and bad.”) At home, thanks to our new president, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts — the equivalent of two and a half F-15s — was under the knife.
I had become a full-time freelance writer at 24, and it’s possible that I didn’t sleep or eat for the next year or two — I was too terrified for my future. After a year of 16-hour days and seven-day weeks, I had $22,000, a twitching left eyelid, and not one article I could point to as the product of passion instead of expedience. As bizarre as it was, “Swimming Pool” — or the reality that had made it possible — felt quite okay as an alternative. Everyone in attendance was young, attractive, and responsible — the invitation had said to bring one’s own flip-flops, and everyone had. And serious: They gazed upon the circus before us with the utmost solemnity.
After the performance, we ended up at Rebhuhn, a traditional tavern just outside the city center. It served a Platonic version of grandmother food — pike-perch in a white-wine-but-mostly-butter sauce, chestnut “pasta” over cream and lingonberry preserves — but the best thing about Rebhuhn wasn’t the food. At one table, a woman was reading a newspaper. At another, three lavishly dressed women were having what you just knew was their every-Sunday-night klatch. There were 20-somethings and 80-somethings. No one was “doing a concept” to “maximize covers,” no one was trying to pretend to touch my soul so they could scour my wallet.
When I ate out at such a place in New York, I felt guilty for lingering because I was infringing on the server’s opportunity to turn the table, something I felt responsible for because American restaurants didn’t pay their servers a living wage. Nowhere did this economic model feel as insane as at Rebhuhn in Vienna on a Sunday evening. “Vienna,” Alex said in another theft-worthy line as he mopped sauce with a cube of fish, “is cultural Xanax.” In America, I realized, we were undergoing a kind of national seizure, the kind where you’d stopped noticing that your shoulders were up all the time because you’d internalized terrible economic insecurity as the norm. Safety — an uncanny feeling, indeed. Perhaps the Europe I’d been imagining — the Vienna Alex had been telling me about almost since we’d met — wasn’t only a fantasy.
ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE CITY that saturated my childhood imagination: the streets themselves. After growing up in one of the Brezhnev-era apartment towers that surrounded Moscow like a cinder-block forest, Vienna struck me as a marvel from a distant antiquity. In fact, the city was transformed in the 19th century by Emperor Franz Joseph I, and it is his Vienna — neo-Baroque, orderly, martial — that visitors see today. Franz Joseph’s vision lent the city the quality that has stayed with me most as an adult, a quality that no amount of skyscrapers can efface — an officious, comforting solemnity.
It was just off one of these imperial streets that Boris and I spent our most educational outing in Vienna — at Gasthaus Grünauer, a partly hidden local institution with an interior so low-ceilinged and rustic that it could’ve been located in Middle-earth. We were meeting my friends. Jutta Ambrositsch is the city’s most talented winemaker; her husband, Marco, operates the business side of the winery. The restaurant’s third-generation proprietor, Christian Grünauer, owner of one of the most sardonic faces I’d seen, reminisced in unaccented English about 1980s New York, where he waited tables at an Upper East Side Italian restaurant called Elio’s. One of the regulars there was Donald Trump. “He was so afraid of germs that he wouldn’t shake anyone’s hand,” Christian recalled, “but look at him now, slapping backs and kissing babies!”
Christian’s wife, Katja, prepared Mitteleuropean soul food — grilled veal kidneys, delicately breaded loin of pork, pan-fried whole trout — so flavorful it nearly made us forget about the virtual absence of vegetables. The scene got an infusion of chaos and originality with an appearance of a 60-something gent named Xandi: pear-shaped, red-nosed, leering, perversely avuncular. According to Marco, he was famous around town for his copious eating and drinking, and was rumored to be the father or guardian of 13 children. He waded around our table kissing everyone ceremoniously and wetly and doffing an imaginary hat, then sat down among us, uninvited. He proceeded to deliver a theatrical speech to Jutta that I failed to understand fully due to my meager German, but judging by the suddenly tense faces around the table, its content must have been cutting if not downright mean.
Xandi was demonstrating Wiener Schmäh, a local strain of humor distinguished by dark absurdity, glee at your friends’ misfortune, and masking insult with flattery. When I asked Marco about it later, he shrugged and said, “In Vienna, no joke is too insulting.” I knew what he meant. Back in Brooklyn, Xandi’s behavior would have caused my American-born friends to lapse into embarrassed silence. But at my Russian-Jewish family’s dinner table, an imaginative verbal jab is met with laughter and a grudging appreciation of the offender’s wit — and so it was at Grünauer. No wonder I felt at home.
FROM OUR SIX-HOUR MARATHON of eating, drinking, and smoking, the next morning I remembered only one thing, breathed into my ear by an older gentleman of uncertain employment but many opinions. (This was Xandi, Alex told me later.) “You know why Vienna is perfect?” he said. “It’s 10 to 20 years more slow than everywhere else.” He slapped his doughy hands together, dropping a good bit of cigarette ash onto my jeans. “No complications.”
(I may have remembered only this because, irresponsibly, I didn’t take out my reporter’s notebook all night. Alex and I were very different kinds of travel writers, it turned out — I wrote down everything, and he often waited to see what stuck in his mind. I had decided to try it his way.)
How had we gotten to a world where this was true? Where the best places in Europe were economic B-listers (Portugal, Spain) and those behind the curve (Austria)? This had its downsides. Austria had some of the most progressive social-welfare policies in the world, but you could still smoke in bars and restaurants, and it would be wrong to say Viennese dining had completely left the Wiener schnitzel behind. (Changes were coming to the safety net, too — several weeks before we arrived, a center-right/radical-right coalition had taken power promising to slash social benefits.)
Also, the state extended cultural funding more readily to established artistic institutions than independent artists, which meant that the dynamism and dislocation created by upstart projects often found an easier home elsewhere. Vienna felt less international than almost any Western European capital I’d visited, and almost no one in it seemed to resemble — in dress, habit, conversational references — the globalized elite. This cultural concentrate created a heady unpredictability — the cost, perhaps, of visiting a place like itself and no other. Prückel, “Swimming Pool,” Rebhuhn, Xandi: Even when mediocre, these experiences felt gloriously unrepeatable elsewhere.
GOING OVER THAT NIGHT THE FOLLOWING MORNING, a last scene came into focus: We were at Café Anzengruber, a spot popular with writers and insomniacs, operated by members of a large Croatian clan. Xandi and a pair of young chefs soon appeared. The owner, Tomi, seemed occupied mostly with taunting his defeated-looking brother-in-law, who kept to himself behind the bar. Tomi brought bottles of Croatian Graševina and schnapps and God knows what else and sat down at the table, toasting extravagantly, and soon we were staggeringly drunk. All of us, that is, except Jutta — she sat grinning shyly and a little remorsefully among seven unlaced, hammered men. Something about her expression brought me back to a scene in my childhood kitchen, where my father and four of his friends shared loud, vodka-lubricated enthusiasms about Levi’s jeans and Edgar Winter records, with my mother functioning as the scene’s unmoving, silent axis.
Later, when I related this memory to Julya Rabinowich, one of the country’s best-known authors, she let out an exasperated guffaw. “When it comes to gender equality, Austria is 50 years behind Germany or France,” she said. Despite being a liberal stronghold, Vienna didn’t provide enough day care to meet public demand, Rabinowich explained, forcing many young mothers to stay at home. As in the country of my birth, all too many men here still expected women to handle the majority of the cooking and child care. I was realizing that, culturally, Vienna shared nearly as much with Warsaw-Pact Eastern Europe as it did with the Western democracies. I found much of that kinship problematic, but I couldn’t deny that for me it made Vienna feel as familiar and comfortable as an old blazer. At last, I was deciphering what drew me to this city: It offered much of the essence and manners of my homeland, amid the relative safety and freedom of my home.
In Rabinowich I found something like a double, whose life diverged from mine in ways that interested me. We were born several months apart; her family immigrated from the Soviet Union two years before mine did, but chose to settle in Vienna. I told Rabinowich that, after arriving as a child in New York, I’d felt almost instantly American. “When I was going to school here, no one allowed me to forget I was a foreigner,” she replied. “On the other hand, the government paid for my education, awarded me a stipend that allowed me to write full time, and honored my books with prizes.” We were drinking coffee in a quiet, pretty café in the city’s third district, where everyone seemed to know her by name. Rabinowich, who writes a newspaper column about politics, lamented that the recent election represented “a sharp turn to the right.” She sighed. “But of course I consider myself an Austrian,” she said. “If I leave, I’ll be in exile.”
FOR ALL THE SINCERITY OF MY SEARCHING, there was very little of 1988 Vienna left to discover. Forced to remain neutral as a condition of Soviet withdrawal after the war, Austria didn’t fully accede to the European Union until the mid-1990s. “When I went to Germany in the ’80s, I carried such lists of things to buy that my German friends would jokingly ask me if I wasn’t coming from East Germany rather than Austria,” as one person told me. But once Austria joined the EU, it didn’t look back. The modest pension where my family had stayed seemed to no longer exist, and the street where it was supposedly located listed no store of kitchen supplies.
So it felt like a miracle when it turned out that the two refugee-aid agencies that had shepherded us to America, the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), had representatives in Vienna that had been around for the great Soviet-refugee influx 30 years earlier. (Both agencies continue to serve refugee populations.) Alex and I met them for coffee at Café Frauenhuber, a tourist-district café that miraculously few tourists seem to know about. (Mozart had given his last public performance upstairs, in 1791. Vienna is like that.) And all of a sudden, I was sitting in front of two men whom I very well may have had already met, half a lifetime before.
“I had no time to go to the washroom,” Walter Juraschek, who was with HIAS, said. The child of World War II Polish refugees, he had been made for the work, and began his days at 3 a.m., coaching atheist Soviet people like my parents and grandparents on how to say the right things about Jewish identity to the American consular officers. (Religious persecution was a precondition for refugee status.) HIAS shared an office with the JDC, and Juraschek remembers the waiting rooms and corridors so packed that muscling his way back and forth to his desk proved a daily challenge. He ran interference with the authorities, such as the police officer who had his arm broken by an iron-swinging woman who thought he was coming to arrest her. When the Danish Embassy turned away a Soviet refugee who hoped to emigrate there, Juraschek bombarded the queen of Denmark with letters until she personally intervened.
Inspired by the meeting, I strayed toward the spot on the map that showed the location of the Stadttempel, the main synagogue in Vienna, located in a warren of streets known as the Bermuda Triangle. During my family’s stay in 1988, we’d been taken by the JDC to get a glimpse of the exterior, as holiday services were in progress inside. My grandfather had not come all that way to look at a facade, so he grabbed my hand, split off from the group, and, me at his waist (I still remember the naphthalene smell of his slacks), prised open the heavy wood door. Inside, we saw something we’d never seen in our atheist homeland: Orthodox Jewish men praying. “Fanatics!” he said, not without affection, and winked at me.
True to the promise of the Bermuda Triangle, there was nothing but the backside of an ornate building where the map said the synagogue would be. It didn’t seem like I was meant to find even this — something that definitely still existed. But then, wandering up a side street, I saw it. Or rather the police van that, sadly, so often signals a Jewish place of worship in Europe these days. Who knew if those were the same wood doors my grandfather and I had touched, but their location was the same. As I stood alone in that alley, not wanting to approach them for fear of my intentions being mistaken — I look Middle Eastern — what I was seeing would have to be good enough. And what I was feeling — my grandfather had passed away a month before I’d arrived in Vienna.
ON THE MORNING AFTER the euphoric, drunken night at Grünauer, Jutta drove Boris and me to see her vineyards on the city’s northernmost edge. As we were getting into her Audi, a Japanese tour group emerged from the U-Bahn station nearby, and a woman in a pantsuit leading the tour suddenly shrieked, “Jutta Ambrositsch!” She introduced us excitedly to the group in rapid-fire Japanese. The tourists reacted to this by surrounding us and bursting into applause.
It was an unseasonably cold, foggy day, and Boris and I ended up tramping through muddy vineyards behind Jutta and her elderly fox terrier, Edgar. The view made up for the mud. Standing among the vines on a hill called Nussberg, we looked out over downtown Vienna, anchored by the jutting, silly Millennium Tower, and finally got a sense of the Danube’s massive span. Yet the city was inaudible — we heard only birds. “I live in the city center and I’m a 20-minute drive from the vineyards,” Jutta marveled, pulling a patched hunting jacket tighter around her. “Where else can you do that?”
As a respite from the cold fog and my hurricane-grade hangover, I went to the Kunsthistorisches Museum to see the Bruegels. I spent a long while in the picture gallery on the second floor, looking at ten large panels. Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s village landscapes refuse to be read as religious allegory and exist as documents of rural communities. Their portrayal of the Flemish villagers is neither humorous nor moralizing nor idealistic; instead, they’re suffused with an acceptance of the cycles of daily life — with their 16th-century miseries intact — and a compassion that borders on the post-human.
I stood in front of Hunters in the Snow and remembered the feeling of first seeing it as a 9-year-old. I could picture myself standing beside my mother in that gallery nearly 40 years earlier; the memory was as detailed as though it had happened last week. Later I sat down at a café amid the museum’s imperial-chocolate-cake decor and ordered coffee and a piece of strudel. Then I called my mother in New York. I told her excitedly where I was, and described what I remembered. She listened patiently. “The admission to that museum was expensive,” she said finally. “So we didn’t go. What you remember never happened.”
ON THE BROKEN-HEADED MORNING after our bacchanal, what Vienna calls coffee — an espresso shot lost in a trough of milk and foam — was not going to suffice. I needed rocket fuel, and, feeling morning-after shame of a different kind, headed for the only solution I could imagine: a Starbucks. There, I did something I’ve never done even in America: I ordered a venti. It was only five minutes back to my rental, but it was five minutes longer than necessary to register the horrified stares of rush-hour Vienna at the RPG in my hands.
In the weeks to come, after Alex and I returned to New York, it would be this moment I’d remember more than any other from the trip, crystals of nostalgia forming almost in real time. But no matter how sweet and less mixed my recollections of Vienna became, the feeling never alchemized into a readiness to consider moving there — or anywhere. Having spent so many years looking toward Europe with longing, I’d failed to register just how American I was becoming — if not always ideologically, then due simply to years of being able to order mediocre coffee in three sizes. It isn’t that you can’t go home again. It’s that once you’ve lost it, every place is just what another place isn’t.
That morning, our last, Alex’s friend Jutta was driving us to the 19th district, a posh enclave on the edge of the city that dead-ends in acres of vineyards, including her own. Afterward, at lunch, I told her about my Vienna history. When I mentioned the kitchenware store I’d walked into, she lit up. “It’s called Ostovics!” she said. “There’s one right near Neubaugasse,” the street where I’d told her our pension may have been located. Memory is as vague as it is rigid. It hadn’t occurred to me that the kitchenware store might be on a nearby street.
I had an interview after lunch, but I raced to Ostovics afterward. I remembered floor-to-ceiling windows rather than its glass recessed in a brick enclosure. But the pots and serving dishes behind the glass were painted as beautifully as artworks and actually lived up to the gleam in my memory. I looked around — no one. I’d been feeling regret that I’d not gone up to touch the synagogue doors. (How observantly Jewish, ironically, my investment of that touch with such talismanic power.) So I went up to the Ostovics window and, feeling like a lunatic, brought my forehead to it, like all those years ago. It was cold and dry outside, and the touch left no trace.

Vienna is well known for its high proportion of social housing. Nowadays most sources seem to estimate that around 25% of people living in the city live in some form of municipal housing. It’s evident as you walk around the city. You cannot walk along a street without coming across a housing block with the very recognisable sign outside the entrance. And with the city celebrating it’s 100th year since the first ‘Gemeindebau’ it’s also inescapable in every exhibition about the city’s history.
Housing is an essential component of any city. And with my background working at one of London’s largest housing design practices, I might be biased, but I didn’t think I could come to Vienna to understand how they are approaching gender equitable design without understanding how the city’s housing works.
The existing centre of Vienna is dense, typically made up of courtyard block typologies. So there are limited opportunities for new housing development. The city has a fairly rigid zoning style ‘building code’, which not only sets out built parameters for building lines at the front and back, as well as heights, but also sets out what land uses are allowed on a block by block basis. This has meant that an increasingly popular form of development in the centre is rooftop extensions, as in most areas only a single storey can be added.
In the centre the majority of housing is comprised of flats. It’s not until you get quite far out that you start encountering detached homes. In the older part of town the flats often have unique layouts as they do away with the traditional arrangement of rooms coming off of a hallway, and instead the rooms themselves act as circulation space. This leads to quite space efficient apartments, even if there are some quirks — such as entering the kitchen through the bathroom! Often this comes about through separate apartments having been combined together to create a more spacious home. This also leads to difficulties with living rooms being above bedrooms and vice versa. The other thing that’s worth noting is that many apartments in Vienna in the old town do not have balconies. But as the flats have tall and lofty rooms you don’t miss this so much.
In Red Vienna the city was really reconceptualising how to design for how people wanted to live. The aim was to provide affordable homes of good quality for broad sectors of the population. The housing provided people with light, fresh air and sunshine, as well as nurseries, schools, lending libraries and other communal facilities like laundry rooms. And with more free time they had to organise their lives differently, and the architecture followed suit too — with more space allowed for leisure too. The kitchen became a different kind of space — often with other functions combined with this space, turning it from a purely functional space to one to dwell in. The focus on the evolving role of the kitchen in the home, at the time, ensured that the needs of all genders were taken into consideration and advanced and adapted to new social norms.
Whilst the social principles from which Red Vienna emerged are not necessarily explicitly evident as you walk around the city, many of the ideals still undoubtedly influence and inform the shape of the city and its housing that you see today. And the legacy of the city’s municipal housing undoubtedly has an influence on the shape of its future housing.
Earlier this year I was awarded the RTPI George Pepler Award by the RTPI. The George Pepler Award is a bursary granted to a person in their first 10 years post qualification experience wishing to undertake a short period of study on a particular aspect of spatial planning. I was delighted to win the opportunity to carry out my research proposal entitled ‘What can the UK learn from Vienna with regards to adopting a gender mainstreaming approach to shape built outcomes?’ I am currently in Vienna for researching how Vienna has made itself more Gender Equal. #GenderEqualCities

The background to my being in Austria in the first place: family. My parents were immigrants to the United States where I was born and grew up. They returned to their home country at some point, which I wasn’t happy about. Long story short: My relationship with this city is ambivalent. I hated it when we first arrived from sunny southern California. It was a completely different world. Over the years, things have changed and a certain cool factor exists plus I love classical music so it’s not the worst place to be spending time.
Here are some cool and weird facts about Vienna along with some of my experiences. Some apply to Austria. Other odd factoids are typically Viennese you won’t find anywhere else.

Tuesday and Wednesday, May 6 and 7
This may be a long post because it covers two days. We are greeted by the Empress Maria Theresa, one of the rare female monarchs we have encountered. The Viennese speak warmly of her and I believe she had a long and peaceful reign. She also had 16 (!) children, one being Marie Antoinette. They were all intermarried, it seems.
There is another monarch, Empress Elizabeth, whose life was much more complicated, but more about her later.
To be honest, I have taken so many pictures of so many buildings that I can’t remember three days later which is which. I just want to give you a sense of each place. All of the cities started with the Celts, then Vikings, then the Roman Empire. Only rare bits of Roman roads and buildings can be seen.
The streets are narrow and curved in the medieval style. The buildings are from later periods. Many have been rebuilt because of WW II.
In Germany the Renaissance style buildings were over the top, like Baroque and Rococo. But Vienna is a little more subdued. It is spacious and grand and elegant without overwhelm.
So here are a few pictures of various buildings and statues. The only thing I can discern is when I’m taking pictures of a church.
This is not a church. This is the old city gate and its alcove, home to the Sisi Museum and the Lippizaner Museum ( the famous dancing white horses).
Speaking of horses, they have horse drawn carriages you can ride? But we didn’t do this.
What was cool was that the horses all had these decorative head pieces that covered their ears. I guess it gets cold in Vienna in the winter.
This is the Imperial Palace in Vienna, which has a ridiculous number of rooms.
This is some statue monarch made to associate himself with God. I’m not sure if was to honor God or himself, but there was that “divine right of kings” thing going centuries ago. And then you remember all the Prince Bishops… so much intertwining of religious and political power.
I was surprised that a truck drove through a pedestrian area! I didn’t expect that.
Street food.
Now this really surprised me. Here is this beautiful building covered with an advertisement. I looked closed and this is actually a fabric painting reproducing the building; it hides the scaffolding and the ad helps disguise the fabric covering. You don’t even notice it’s fake. A disguise of a disguise.
This is a church. I think it’s St. Stephen’s.
Note the beautiful tiled roof.
It’s always hard to get a picture of the whole church but I got this replica.
Pictures of inside the church follow.
And there is always a gift shop.
After the official tour we decided to go wander around Vienna. Chocolate, anyone? ( I’m talking to you, Abby.) They gave samples, like at an ice cream store.
This made us hungry so we stopped in a coffee shop and of course you need a pastry to go along with your coffee. Even Chappell drank coffee in honor of the tradition.
Interesting sights along the way. Bicycles often have a large front container to carry groceries or to ferry children. If they ferry children they have little car seats with seat belts.
Poor dog!
(Rachel I know. I don’t have many dogs here but not as many people have dogs and they don’t let you pet them.)
Chappell asked me what I wanted to do next. I wanted to go to the Sisi Museum. I’m sure Jeremy knows all about this because he knows about everything. I had never heard of her but she had a tragic life. I am told it is now a Netflix series called “Princess Elizabeth.”
When you go into the museum the first thing you see a is a plaster death mask. She was quite poetic and expressed her melancholy in her journals. They were posted on the walls throughout.
“But mournfully I spread my wide, white wings, return home to the fairy kingdom and nothing shall bring me back again.”
“I am Sunday’s child, a child of the sun. Her golden rays she wove into my throne; with her glow she wove her crown. It is her light that I live, but should she ever wane from me, I must die.”
Sisi grew up in Bavaria out in the countryside. It was an idyllic childhood. She is the little girl in each of these pictures.
This is a bust of her at age 10. She grew into a beautiful young woman who was known for her beautiful hair.
These were some of her Crown Jewels.
And some of her ball gowns.
Her fan
These were her staterooms.
And her personal exercise room.
And her bedroom
Sisi lived a very sad life. She hated the constraints of the court and its duties, but her real torture was her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law was terribly overbearing and ruled with an iron fist.
Even so, the couple was reasonably happy. Sisi was away on a state visit with her husband when their child died at age 6. That caused a rift in their marriage that was never repaired. Sisi began traveling throughout Europe without her husband; she seemed to have given up on her son and left him behind to the “care” of his mother-in-law. (Sisi’s son Rudolph was a disaster, probably as a result of his horrible upbringing.) Sisi, herself, wore black during these sad, later years.
“Elizabeth’s incessant traveling is increasingly characterized by unease and restlessness. The “lady in black” constantly sought to escape the burden of her own personality and was prey to profound melancholy.”
At age 61 she was assassinated by an anarchist who just wanted to create some chaos. She was never meant to be the target, but she was at the wrong place at the wrong time. What a tragic life.
The next day we woke up with a boat gas station and attendant right outside our balcony. I had never thought about the need to fuel up or how they would do that. I’d love to know more about all the behind the scenes workings of the ship.
Chappell had gone to the Schonnbrun Palace (the summer residence), so I had the morning to myself. I had been thinking about going to the Klint Museum but couldn’t get an appointment that didn’t conflict with a planned afternoon tour of the Vienna Boys Choir. So I just spent a sunny morning in the lounge. (This is also where I caught up on my posts.)
This was the view of modern Vienna on the opposite bank from the old city. It’s all very new and modern.
That afternoon I took a trip to the home of the Vienna Boys choir, but it’s more than one choir of boys.
It functions as a boarding school set in a beautiful old neighborhood in Vienna.
These are the formal gardens.
Everything is “old Vienna.”
The choir has been in existence since before 1500 and was always supported by the royalty. During these centuries the boys were dressed as little soldiers in the king’s army. After the fall of the monarchy the uniforms were changed to sailor suits. This was not because they had a navy but because sailor suits were normal attire for children at that time.
We were escorted into an oval room with perfect acoustics and serenaded by 18 boys in the choir.
Of course the music was angelic. Their voices were were so pure and clear. I think I will never forget the sound of their voices.
I had hoped for that but I learned things I never expected.
They started the performance with “There’s no business like show business” which was quite a surprise. They sang a wide range of music as a group, with occasional solos and duets.
The children are from all over the world and tour all over the world. It was touching to see a Russian boy and a Ukrainian boys singing side by side. It was perhaps appropriate because their last song was “We are the world, we are the children.” They consider themselves as ambassadors.
They are more than a boys choir. There is a non-residential elementary school for children ages 6–10, with quite an emphasis on music. If the children show an interest and aptitude, there are simple auditions for admission to the residential middle school and choir for ages 10–14.
There are actually four choirs of about 24 boys each. Each choir is named after a great composer, such as the Brahms choir, the Mozart choir, etc. One choir is always on tour while the other choirs have school. There is also a girls’ choir for ages 10–14 with their own conductor. The girls attend the school but go home at night; a dormitory for them is being planned. Their is now a high school, so the children can continue their education and be part of the youth choir. Some stay, but others opt for a normal high school life (if such a thing exists).
It’s good to know, though, that they have a normal life. I got this photo of some of the boys were playing soccer. They still get to be kids.

Despite its size, Austria’s capital has the feel of a large town. According to global rankings, Vienna is one of the most livable cities in the world. Because of excellent public services, economic success, and low crime rates. At the time of writing, Vienna had been named the world’s unfriendliest city. Don’t you think it’s a bit contentious?
Here are some useful hints and details about Vienna, Austria, as well as driving directions. We can say that getting around Vienna is a breeze.
The city is divided into 23 districts. A neighborhood that surrounds the “Ringstraße” — Ring street.
By simply walking down this street, you can see many sights in Vienna.In the past, fortifications guarding the city stood where Ringstraße now stands.
Austrians frequently refer to districts by their numbers. “I live in the first!” or “I have to travel to the tenth tomorrow!” you might hear. Isn’t that not at all Germans?
You can tell which district you are in by looking at the number on the street name sign.

With the greatest of delights I just realised something: all my life, I have been living in Red Cities — cities with a Socialist history. All the cities I loved and lived in — Ghent in Belgium, Jerusalem in Israel, Firenze in Italy, and now Vienna — were, and sometimes still are, fiery red, and proud of it.
I have been in Vienna for nearly fifteen years now, and I have gradually discovered a place and a history that traditional travel guides won’t tell you much about. Yet this Rotes Wien is visible everywhere, in every district you visit and on nearly every street you walk through.

For the first time in a long time,
I feel like myself again.
Not the version I had to shrink to be loved,
not the one who stayed quiet to keep the peace,
not the girl who called the bare minimum “enough.”
She walked through hell,
but I left her there —
with the people who fed off her silence
and mistook her kindness for weakness.
Now, I’m done explaining,
done waiting to be chosen,
done carrying weight that was never mine.
I’ve never felt so *light.*
There’s sunlight in my bones again,
a laugh I don’t have to fake,
and dreams I’m finally letting breathe.
Next week: Florida.
Me and my friends, chasing the sun,
singing too loud, dancing barefoot,
and soaking in every golden hour like it’s a promise.
Then — Europe.
A one-way ticket and no return date.
No plan but joy.
No map but instinct.
I want to get lost on purpose.
To fall in love with places, moments, and maybe even myself again.
To write my story across coastlines and cafés,
with no one’s voice in my head but mine.
This summer isn’t an escape —
it’s a return.
To who I was before the noise.
To who I’ve *always* been, underneath the wreckage.
And this time,
I’m not just moving on —
I’m moving *up.*
Unapologetically.
Unstoppably.
Unforgettably.
With love (and finally, freedom),
**Me**

"“Red Vienna”: the most liveable city on Earth, and why we need to be good ancestors",https://medium.com/@nickydromey60/red-vienna-the-most-liveable-city-on-earth-and-why-we-need-to-be-good-ancestors-d7ff11d16d19,"Sign up

“Are we being good ancestors?”. This was the question posed by the American virologist Jonas Salk in 1955, after developing the first effective vaccine against polio. He refused to patent the vaccine, missing out on millions in earnings, believing that the best way to become a good ancestor was to give it away to anyone who needed it.
Long-term thinking, and becoming a good ancestor, does not come naturally to humanity. Corporate executives are flustered about quarterly reports, and seek the dopamine hit of immediate growth rather than implementing a long-term strategy. Political leaders focus on the next set of parliamentary elections, rather than worry about long-term issues, such as the climate crisis or sustainable development. Far too often, we are consumed by the “tyranny of now”, rather than the “power of yet”, to use Carol Dweck’s phrase.
We see this in Ireland, and its attitude to housing. Last year, there was a lot of chat in the media about the €750 tax credit for renters, announced in the last budget. I appreciate this, but it does nothing to address the real problem — lack of supply. Everybody in this country, except possibly legislators in the Dáil, knows that there is an acute shortage of housing here.
No tax credit ever built a house or an apartment. It also means nothing to the person that can’t find a property to rent in Dublin or Cork. This example of the “tyranny of now”, which the coalition government may be using to gain voters for next year’s general election, needs to be replaced with a longer-term strategy, the “power of yet”. One city provides an example of such a strategy.
In this essay, I discuss Vienna, a city that used the “power of yet” to fix a housing crisis 100 years ago. Immigration exacerbated the city’s housing shortage, leaving hundreds of thousands of Viennese living without running water or toilet facilities. I will tell you about “Red Vienna”, and how a left-wing municipal government built a “Ring Road of the Proletariat”, without creating crime-ridden communities. I will also show you how this legacy endures today — today, Vienna is the most liveable city in the world. Viennese policymakers from 100 years ago are rightly remembered as good ancestors; Irish policymakers could be as well.

Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the First World War, Vienna, then home to 2 million people, found itself in a desperate situation. Wartime rationing and inflation had left middle-class professionals and businessowners on the brink of starvation and vulnerable to infectious diseases. Vienna, once the sparkling capital of a multi-ethnic empire, home to Croats, Slovenes, Czechs, Poles, and of course Austrians and Hungarians, was now an overcrowded city within a war-ravaged state. The treaty of Saint-Germain, signed in 1919, explicitly forbade the new German-speaking republic from unifying with Germany, enraging socialists and nationalists alike.
Vienna, now home to 28% of the population of the newly established Republic of Austria, lacked basic amenities, such as food and clothing, largely due to trade embargos imposed on it by the Triple Entente. Hyperinflation rendered War Bonds worthless, eliminating the savings of the middle and upper classes. Supply chains to Vienna from its empire were cut off by the existence of new borders, making the supply of food even more difficult. Communists and fascists in the city stirred up working-class grievances, leading to strikes and political violence.
Just as we see in the English-speaking world today, Vienna had a chronic shortage of affordable housing. Over 250,000 Viennese workers lived in small apartment blocks, known as “Bassena”, with no access to running water. Many of Vienna’s “Bettgeher” (“bed lodgers”) lived in rent-by-the-room accommodations, in which residents could only sleep in their beds for half of the day, effectively sleeping in shifts. These units lacked windows or toilet facilities, depriving renters of cleanliness and sunlight. The units weren’t even cheap; a 2022 study from MIT calculated that rent could cost up to 25% of a family’s income. These unsanitary yet expensive homes remind me of Awaab Ishak, a two-year-old child who died from exposure to mould in a flat in Rochdale in England last year.
Like Ireland today, Vienna’s housing shortage came in response to an influx of immigrants. Between 1880 and 1910, its total number of inhabitants jumped from 726,000 to over 2 million, placing it on a par with Paris and Berlin. For instance, Jewish immigrants, granted full citizenship by the Empire in 1867, flocked to the city from Hungary, Moravia and Galicia. The names of the new arrivals read like a who’s who of fin-de-siècle European intellectual life: Sigmund Freud was born in Moravia, before moving to the city with his family when he was four years old. Theodor Herzl, the founder of the modern Zionist movement, was born in Budapest, before arriving in Vienna to study law.
3.
In 1919, the city held its Gemeinderat (Municipal Elections), electing as its mayor the socialist Jakob Reumann. Reumann, a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria (SDAP), made the then-innovative decision to build 25,000 units subsided public housing for Austrian workers, financed by progressive taxes on land and luxury goods, such as champagne and cars. About 40 percent of the costs of building the houses came from taxes on upper-class properties. From 1919 to 1933, the city council was the only entity that built new homes.
In 1927, construction began on Karl-Marx-Hof (literally “Karl Marx Court”). Finished in 1930, it was designed by Karl Ehn, an architect and socialist who apprenticed under Otto Wagner, a native of Vienna, and founder of the Art Nouveau architectural movement. The Karl-Marx-Hof consisted of green spaces, play areas and amenities such as a pharmacy and a post office. Comprised of 1,382 apartments, and designed for a population of about 5,000, it spanned about 1.2 kilometres in length, making it the longest single residential buildings in the world. Other hofe, such as Engelshof, Bebelhof, and George-Washington-Hof, emerged during the same period. Public baths like the Amalienbad, opened in 1926, provided proper sanitation for lower-class Viennese, as well as a safe place to socialise.
Just as NIMBYists (not-in-my-back-yard) today warn that increasing the supply of social housing will create a new generation of “school dropouts, drug users, non-workers and criminals”, there was a moral panic around the provision of housing in Vienna too. The taxes needed to finance their construction were viciously opposed by “Black Vienna”, which consisted of conservative landowners and leaders, monarchists, anti-Semites and Catholic radicals. They whined about “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”, potentially effective dog whistles in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
As noted previously, the planners of “Red Vienna” were followers of Otto Wagner and his Art Nouveau movement. The Art Nouveau style, used to design Viennese buildings such as the Majolica House and the Secession Building, used intricate patterns, curving lines, and the use of materials like glass, ceramics and iron. Using similarly elaborate patterns helped to make the new apartment blocks, spanning the “Ring Road of the Proletariat” on Margaretengurtel in southern Vienna, look like upper-class dwellings. Harvard historian Eve Blau sums up the pragmatic case for beautiful social houses thus: “If you’re planning something radical, it’s not a bad idea to come across as conservative as possible”.
4.
By 1934, the Viennese city council had built about 64,000 apartments, which housed 10% of the city’s population. Like the Karl-Marx-Hof, these too were equipped with everyday amenities. As well as the city’s progressive tax system, this impressive rate of construction was assisted by the city council’s intelligent use of rent controls. First implemented in 1922, rent controls initially disincentivised the private development of private buildings, reducing the price of urban land. The council could then purchase the land at the discounted price and create jobs by building on it.
“Red Vienna” would be suspended in 1934, following the establishment of the Standestaat, a one-party fascist state rendered paranoid by the perceived evils of “tax bolshevism” and “communist tyranny”. Between 1938 and 1945, the country would be occupied by the Nazis, led of course by a genocidal Austrian corporal with a silly moustache. After the war, which left over 20% of the city’s housing stock partially or completely destroyed, the Social Democrats regained power, and “Red Vienna” returned with a vengeance. Projects such as the Per-Albin-Hansson-Siedlung in Favoriten, home to 14,000 residents, came into being. In 1969, Vienna constructed its 100,000th new home since the end of Nazi rule.
Today, over 60% of Vienna’s 1.8 million people live in subsidized housing. Local authorities own and manage about 220,000 housing units, about one-quarter of the city’s total housing stock, and indirectly controls 200,000 units that are owned by private-developers but governed by a city-regulated process. In 1984, the city set up a “Land Procurement and Urban Renewal Fund” that reserves land in the city for affordable homes and amenities — as of 2019, the fund owned over 3 million square metres of land. In 2018, the city passed legislation, requiring that for all housing projects with over 5,000 square metres of space, at least two thirds of the new builds must be subsided. Recent projects include the 850-apartment Wohnpark Neue Donau and the 1,004-unit Kabelwerk estate.
5.
The positive consequences of Vienna’s commitment to housing development are obvious. A 2023 report shows that average rents are just over a quarter those of European cities such as Paris and Oslo. Figures for monthly rents, which by law cannot be more than 25% of a tenant’s income, are often as low as €500 or €600, less than one-third those of Dublin, and can even fall as low as €250 for long-term residents.
It should therefore come as little surprise that Vienna has been selected as the most liveable city in the world in eight of the past ten years by the Economist, including last year. For context, London ranks 34th and Dublin comes in at 37th. This survey takes each city’s accessibility, healthcare, infrastructure and culture into account, and is a testament to the enduring legacy of “Red Vienna” and the “power of yet”.
6.
In this essay, I have described “Red Vienna”, and how it demonstrates the significance of long-term thinking. I have shown you how a formerly impoverished place became the most liveable city on Earth. It is not as if the “power of yet” is entirely foreign to Ireland — in the 1920s, the German company Siemens built the Ardnacrusha Generating Station in County Clare, a project that required almost one-fifth of the Free State’s entire annual budget. The new power station harnessed the waters of the river Shannon to generate about 96% of Ireland’s electricity requirements. The State was poor back then. Now it is estimated that the country will have a €65.2 billion budget surplus by 2027; a pot of gold from foreign multinationals. Let us be good ancestors and spend it.

…Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role…
We had the pleasure of interviewing Martina Huemann. Martina is Professor at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business where she heads the Project Management Group in the Department Strategy and Innovation and is the Academic Director of the Professional MBA Program: Project Management. She has published widely in the fields of Project Management and Human Resource Management. For her Research on Human Resource management in Project-oriented Organisations, she received the IPMA Research Award 2015.
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory”? What led you to this particular career path?
Born in Vienna, Austria I am currently living between Vienna and London. While in Vienna I am Academic Director of the Vienna Executive MBA: Strategic Project Management and lead the Project Management Group in the Institute of Strategic Management at WU Vienna. For 1,5 years I am a Full Professor of Project Leadership and Society at University College London, Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction.
I am Editor-in Chief of International Journal of Project Management, the leading journal in Project Research and Founding Editor-in-Chief of Project Leadership and Society and hold several board positions in national and international Associations.
I have two children, two boys, one born 1997 and one born 2005.
Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
My career was probably not expected from me. As I was the first one in my family who made it to university. My parents came from a simple background, my mother was educated as a tailor but run a small shop and my father was a warehouse worker for a newspaper. While both not having much formal education, they always gave me the feeling that I can achieve everything what I want.
I also did my studies at WU Vienna and when I entered the building I felt not belonging there, more an alien. I had no role models in my family. However, I decided that I wanted to get more knowledge and a formal education. I studied Business Administration. During the weekends Friday to Sunday night, I worked 20 hours plus in an ice cream shop to contribute to financing my life.
I always having a drive for learning, getting to know something new, but also for visiting other countries and traveling. I am a quite curious person interested in understanding different subjects and contexts, meeting new people and making a difference.
During my studies I spent one semester in Prague and later one semester in Lund Sweden. I was travelling and had the opportunity to engage in different projects, one of those was an EU funded project bringing Didactics to Middle and Eastern Europe countries like Poland, Tech Republic and Slovakia. I was engaged there as a student evaluator. Looking back this got me interested in universities, teachings and in projects and how change can be organised trough projects. Which set the ground also for my interest to research and educate how to manage projects.
When I finally finished my graduate studies, I got a position at a newly established small department at WU focused on Project Management. I supported the establishment of that university unit, its research and education programme. Finally, I received a position funded by the university and started my doctorate in Project Management. I early got involved internationally in the International Project Management Association as I was taken there through my professor. That helped me immensely to build my network.
My first son was born shortly after I received my first university financed position. This caused quite some turbulence. I was questioned by my work environment if family was now my priority and if leaving academia would be better for me. I took a quite short maternity leave and went back to keep my position and finished my doctorate.
My career was only possible with my partner and especially the of my mother and the father of my partner. who helped a lot with the childcare. To make a university career in my context I had to pursue a Habitation, and which set a further milestone in my career that opened the door for my professorship.
Can you share a pivotal moment in your career that significantly influenced your path to leadership?
As an early career researcher, I received a quite tempting invitation to apply for positions at another university abroad. But I decided not to go for it as I would have needed to take the whole family to a different country. It would have been very difficult for my partner to find a job and I felt it was not appropriate to ask my partner and my family to start somewhere new just because of my career aspirations.
This is also the reason why I did my career at WU Vienna. While it was international and I have been engaged in International Associations like International Project Management Association or Project Management Institute, I remained a stable main position at WU Vienna. However as my children are now grown up, I did apply for a professorship at University College London and reduced my position at WU.
Ok, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. According to this report, only about 31.7% of top executive positions across industries are held by women. This reflects great historical progress, but it also shows that more work still has to be done to empower women. In your opinion and experience what is currently holding back women from leadership and management?
Many different issues. Most of them are structural
Woman are socialized with a set of desired behaviours expected from them.
Can you share a few reasons why more women should become leaders and managers?
Women and men are different, and this is good. People are different in their personalities and talents and hey bring different perspective and contributions.
Studies show that women in board rooms make a positive effect on company performance. The offer is to see women (and other minorities) rather as an asset and help to build structures to support them to provide contributions.
Can you please share “5 Things We Need To Increase Women’s Engagement in Leadership and Management?” If you can, please share an example or story for each.
First, targeted mentoring and coaching are essential. Women often face barriers to accessing high-quality mentorship, so structured programs help women identify their strengths, set clear goals, and navigate leadership challenges. I remember when my employer once said, “Try it for six months. If it doesn’t work, you can go back.” That kind of mentoring gave me a safe space to test my leadership skills without the fear of permanent failure, which really helped me move forward in my career.
Proactive networking is another important factor. Women need to actively create or join networks that connect them with senior leaders and like-minded peers. These networks provide access to important contacts and sponsorship opportunities.
Flexible working arrangements are also crucial. The challenge of balancing professional and family responsibilities often deters women from pursuing leadership roles. By adopting flexible hours, job-sharing, or part-time management positions, leadership roles can be made more accessible. In my own experience, I’ve seen the positive effects of companies offering more flexibility. In one example, a company revamped its policies to allow flexible scheduling, which allowed a talented leader to balance her childcare responsibilities with her role on the board. The result was improved team performance.
Inclusive leadership training and culture change are necessary to break away from traditional, male-dominated leadership models. Women should be encouraged to lead without having to adopt a “male” style, and leadership training should highlight the strengths women bring to the table. I’ve seen organisations that revamped their training programs to focus on emotional intelligence and collaborative leadership. This approach helped one female manager I know feel more confident and authentic in her promotion to a top management role.
Finally, objective recruitment and promotion processes are critical. Using methods like structured personality assessments and behaviour-based interviews helps combat unconscious bias and ensures candidates are chosen based on merit.
In your opinion, what systemic changes are needed to facilitate more equitable access for women to leadership roles?
Companies must embrace legislation that promotes gender diversity, like the EU’s push for more women on boards. However, quotas alone aren’t enough — accountability is key to preventing tokenism.
Corporate cultures need to evolve to value leadership traits that women excel in, such as empathy and collaboration. Changing outdated success metrics to reflect these qualities is essential, and recruitment and promotion processes must also be free from bias, prioritising merit over personal connections.
Work-life integration policies should be standard, not exceptions. Companies must normalise flexible work options for everyone, not just working mothers. Investing in female leadership development early on through mentorship, training, and networks like the WU Executive Academy’s Female Leaders Network ensures women have the resources to succeed in senior roles.
These systemic changes won’t happen overnight, but when companies and policymakers commit to action rather than discussion, real progress follows.
What strategies have you found most effective in mentoring and supporting other women to pursue leadership positions?
My main strategy is to empower young women to find their own ways and learn to trust in themselves. I am mentoring several women to help them in their academic careers. Very operationally I help them to understand their strengths and especially help them to understand they are not required to deliver 110% all the time. A trap that I have tapped in during my career and which I could not continue especially after I had my children.
A funny story to share was at one of my first panels I was invited to. I prepared so much and worked on my performance in every detail. I just wanted to be able to provide the perfect answers to all possible questions. Which is of cause not possible. However, I did not stop preparing and did not sleep the night before the event. So, when I was sitting at the panel, I was very tired, very serious and concentrated to get it all right. Without any smile, quite fact oriented. I was knowledgeable, said the right things, but my message was not convincing. It was just one boring smart voice among many others. Additionally, when others were speaking, I was so tiered that I simply fell asleep in front of 300 people. My sleep only took some seconds, and I still hope nobody saw it. However, that situation taught me an important lesson which I use to encourage women not to over prepare, take life a little easier, consider the package, how to deliver the message and not only what.
And yes we women cannot have everything at the same time. Children and major career steps at the same time is (almost) not possible to pursue at the same time. But there is also the right time for everything. Not everything needs to happen till the age of 35.
A good personal example is my recent career step, the appointment as Professor at University College London. When I was invited to apply, my youngest child was to finish School thus it was a window of opportunity that had opened, but it is then also a decision if you want to get you out of your comfort zone.
How would you advise a woman leader about how to navigate the challenges of being a woman in a leadership role within a male-dominated industry?
When I did my first formal education in Project Management, it was in 1996 and it was the Certificate Programme “International Project Management”, back then offered by the WU Vienna and the Technical University Vienna. There were 20 participants in class, 19 men and me. All of them having technical background mainly Engineering, Construction and Information Technology, the typical industries in which Project Management was applied back then. My background was Business Administration (specialized in Marketing) and I was the only woman. I was again an obvious alien, especially as I was the only woman in the room, and I was young. In this situation I asked myself whether I fit in? But reframed my question in what I can bring to the table, what are my competencies my talents that I can contribute and makes me add value. In this situation it was my social competencies, my strength to observe, listen and ask questions, thus my talent to lead processes in groups that added value and allowed me to add value. This is also my advice to women, know what you are good at understand what added value you can bring to the table. Be authentic and play to your strengths.
How do you balance the demand for authoritative leadership with the stereotypical expectations of female behaviour in professional settings?
Well use stereotypes like the hard man and the soft woman because that makes live easier to us. But the world is not black and white. If we look in more detail I do not believe in authoritarian leadership. Hero leadership is not working, especially not with younger generations. Hierarchies have become flatter, people want to work flexible, self organised, autonomy has become important, that is reflected in a modern leadership that is flatter, shared, distributed and often puts purpose in the foreground.
A leader needs be reflective person who takes decisions timely and is accountable for them. Core competences are to navigate uncertainty, embrace change, give orientation to others, think strategically and engaging others to co-create the future of an organisation. Today leaders should be able to stand in the spotlight but also is able to share the spotlight with others.

I woke up this morning at dawn…I wasn’t quite sure where I was until I opened the window. The sun was rising in the horizon and it clicked: “Vienna!”
I had always dreamed of Vienna as this elegant and majestuous city, home of Sisi the Empress and fairy tales my mum used to read me in bed. I remember the history books in high school with pictures of the Austro-Hungarian Empire portraying royal families and castles. The heart of Europe.
I left my hotel not knowing exactly where I was headed to; all I wanted was to travel back in time, wander through history, let the city surprise me and instinct be my guide.
As I approached the centre, the magic started to unfold: majestic buildings like the Parliament, the Museum…I walked through a manicured garden that led me straight into the statue of Mozart. It reminded me that Vienna is The City Of Music, home to Beethoven and Schubert and I can understand where they got the inspiration to…

I wish I never met you.
I don't think there was any good reason behind it I think it was an accident.
Like, Fate got distracted looking at its phone, and when it looked back up, we’d crashed into each other, and it was too late.
The damage was done, and we had met.
I don't think it was a good lesson or that it had made me tougher or a better person I think it just became part of the reason I'm not the same anymore.
The reason I'm so closed off, the reason I don't trust people at all anymore.
I don't think we were supposed to meet.
I think it was a complete misfortune.
And sometimes I think about the day it happened and how one minor decision could have stopped the whole thing.
One moment could have saved me.
Because if we had never met, I would still be all the good parts of me, and there would be a few less parts that need to be fixed.
And I would still go for drives, but you wouldn't enter my thoughts like you were robbing a bank.
And I would still have these friends, but we would not reflect on how warped I was during the time you were a part of my life.
And I would still have fallen in love again, and it wouldn't have taken as much reassurance.
I wouldn't have been shocked that love is so different than I had originally thought.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, sure, but I'd be strong anyway, and the time I spent around you is dead to me, wasted time.
I wish I never met you.
I wish fate had been paying attention.
It was an accident that wasn't waiting to happen, a calamity, a catastrophe, a mistake.

Vienna, the capital of Austria, is a city steeped in history and culture, with a breathtaking array of stunning architecture, art, and museums. From the grand Baroque palaces to the intricately designed cathedrals, Vienna is a city that exudes elegance and sophistication. As you stroll through the streets of Vienna, you can’t help but be enchanted by the city’s rich history, its artistic vibrancy, and its charming atmosphere.
One of the must-see architectural wonders of Vienna is the St. Stephen’s Cathedral, a Gothic masterpiece that dominates the city’s skyline. With its towering spires and intricate stained glass windows, this cathedral is a testament to the city’s religious heritage and artistic prowess.
Another iconic landmark in Vienna is the Hofburg Palace, a grand and sprawling complex that served as the home of the Habsburg emperors for over six centuries. This Baroque palace is a magnificent example of Vienna’s architectural legacy, with its ornate facades, grand ballrooms, and opulent gardens.
Vienna is also home to a wide range of world-class museums, showcasing everything from classical art to modern design. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, for instance, is a treasure trove of paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts from across the globe, while the Belvedere Palace is home to an impressive collection of Austrian art, including works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.
As you explore the streets of Vienna, you’ll discover a city that is steeped in history and culture, with an atmosphere that is at once lively and relaxed. Whether you’re a history buff, an art lover, or simply looking to soak up the city’s unique charm, Vienna is sure to captivate your senses and leave you with memories that will last a lifetime.
Austria is renowned for its rich culinary traditions that draw inspiration from both its imperial past and its diverse cultural influences. From the classic Wiener Schnitzel to the sweet and indulgent Sachertorte, the city is a food lover’s paradise. The atmosphere and vibe of the Viennese food and drink scene is a delightful combination of tradition and innovation, showcasing the city’s culinary creativity and history.
Austrian cuisine is heavily influenced by its location in Central Europe, with hearty meat dishes and stews, such as Tafelspitz, a traditional beef dish, and Gulasch, a Hungarian-inspired beef and paprika stew, being popular staples. The Wiener Schnitzel is perhaps the most well-known Viennese dish, consisting of a thin, breaded and pan-fried veal cutlet served with a side of potato salad. The aroma of sizzling schnitzels and the sound of the crisp breading are unmistakable, and the dish is ubiquitous across the city’s traditional taverns and high-end restaurants alike.
But Austrian cuisine is not just about meat dishes. The country is also famous for its pastries and sweets, which are often enjoyed alongside a cup of coffee in one of the city’s many traditional coffeehouses. The Sachertorte, a rich chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam, is an iconic Viennese dessert that has been served in the city since the 19th century. Another classic is the Apfelstrudel, a pastry filled with apples, cinnamon and raisins, which is a perfect accompaniment to a hot cup of coffee on a chilly afternoon.
Vienna is also renowned for its coffee culture, with a long history of traditional coffeehouses that date back to the 18th century. These coffeehouses are more than just places to grab a caffeine fix, they are social and cultural hubs where locals come to relax, read the newspaper, and engage in conversation. The atmosphere is one of relaxed elegance, with plush chairs, marble tables, and waiters dressed in traditional attire. A visit to one of these coffeehouses is a quintessential Viennese experience, and a must-do for any traveler.
For those looking for something stronger, Austria is also famous for its wines and beers. The country’s wine regions are concentrated in the east, and produce some of the world’s finest white wines, such as Gruner Veltliner and Riesling. Austrian beer, on the other hand, is renowned for its crisp, refreshing taste, with brands such as Ottakringer and Schwechater being popular choices among locals.
Vienna is a city of contrasts, where grand palaces and museums coexist with gritty street art and alternative subcultures. While the city’s famous landmarks and tourist attractions are undoubtedly worth a visit, there are also many creative and less touristic neighborhoods that offer a glimpse into a different side of Vienna.

Vienna has a rich and complex history, with cultural influences from all over Europe and beyond. The city’s impressive architecture and museums are a testament to this legacy, showcasing the many different styles and periods that have shaped Vienna’s cultural heritage.
The atmosphere in Vienna is one of refinement and sophistication, with a strong sense of history and tradition.

While Vienna is a city with a rich cultural heritage and plenty of sights to see, sometimes it can be nice to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and explore some of the recreational spaces outside of Vienna. These areas offer a chance to relax, recharge, and take in the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.
One popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts is the Vienna Woods, a range of hills and forests just outside of the city. The Vienna Woods offer a range of activities, including hiking, cycling, and horseback riding, as well as numerous picnic areas and lookout points that offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The atmosphere in the Vienna Woods is one of peace and tranquility, with a strong connection to nature.

Vienna is a city that is easily navigable, with a well-developed public transportation system that makes it easy to get around.

The U-Bahn has a modern and efficient vibe, with clean and well-maintained stations and trains that run frequently throughout the day.
Another popular option for getting around Vienna is by bicycle. Vienna has an extensive network of bike paths and bike lanes that make it easy and safe to cycle through the city. Renting a bike is a great way to explore Vienna’s neighborhoods and get a closer look at the city’s architecture and historic landmarks. The atmosphere while cycling through Vienna is one of freedom and independence, with a strong sense of connection to the city and its surroundings.
For those who prefer a more leisurely pace, walking is also a great way to explore Vienna. The city is compact and easy to navigate on foot, with many of the top sights and attractions within walking distance of each other. Walking through Vienna allows you to take in the atmosphere of the city at a slower pace, with plenty of opportunities to stop and explore the many shops, cafes, and restaurants that line the streets.
Vienna is a city that can be enjoyed throughout the year, with each season offering a unique atmosphere and vibe. However, the best time to visit Vienna in terms of climate is during the spring and fall months. In the spring, the city comes to life as the weather warms up, with colorful blooms and lush greenery lining the streets and parks. In the fall, the cooler temperatures bring a crispness to the air, and the changing leaves paint the city in hues of red and gold. The atmosphere during these seasons is one of vibrancy and renewal, making it an ideal time to explore Vienna’s rich culture and history while enjoying comfortable weather conditions.

I am just back from a two-day workshop in Vienna. I am intellectually energized, as these small-scale workshops are the most productive academic sessions. It was an official meeting of the EASA Media Anthropology Network. It was great to catch up with some of the members I already knew and meet new academics. You can find the workshop program here. The event was supported by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, which is located in a historical building: the PSK Building. I presented on Local Knowledge and the Cultural Contexts of AI, which I am pursuing as part of my intellectual and research agenda nowadays.
I have visited Vienna several times, so I wasn’t into sightseeing. The weather was fantastic, and walking around the city was beautiful. Still, I could “unsave” in my Google Maps to places in my Atlas Obscura list! Josephinum (Old-school medical museum with more than 1,000 wax anatomical models created in the 18th century) and Pathological-anatomical collection in the Narrenturm (wikipedia entry) (Striking former mental hospital from the 1700s, now home to exhibitions on anatomy, illness & death.).
No photos allowed above, but you can see some here.

We arrived at the Residence to discover a spectacularly landscaped backyard:
We’re grateful for having arrived in time to enjoy it in all its blooming glory.
The dogs arrived unfazed and adapted quickly. They appreciated the opportunity to be outside in the gorgeous weather. Rosie assumed her sentinel stance…
…while Nero demonstrated his uncanny ability to get comfortable anywhere and on any surface, as long as it’s near us:
We had an opportunity to wander the commercial district on Währinger Straße near the Residence — an unforgettable first impression of the Vienna neighborhood:
And a grim reminder that the reverberations from Dallas are felt around the world:

Loving you was easy, letting go is tough!
You’ll never hear me say, “I wish I had never met you,” although sometimes I feel that way.
You’re my every thought — both the reason I cry and the reason I smile.
I never thought I’d be so hurt over something that didn’t last all that long.
The pressure on my heart when I think of how our relationship got worse and not better! But out of everyone who could have hurt me, why did it have to be you?

It is supposed to be the best restaurant in Vienna and the only Austrian entry (at No.15) on The List. Everyone we met in Vienna had only good things to say about the place, and we’d managed (I am still not sure how) to get a reservation at short notice. By the time Wednesday evening came, we’d had our fill of Weinerschnitzel and Tafelschpitz and 4 long days of conference food, and our anticipation over this meal had reached a fever pitch.
The Steirereck is located at the end of a long driveway leading into the heart of Stadtpark. It’s ensconsed in an elegant glass walled building that was glowing golden with incandescent light on a dismal wet Austrian evening of our dinner reservation. As I walked up the drive I was almost disappointed that we only managed a dinner reservation. I could imagine how incredibly impressive the high glass windows of the nouveau architectural building would have looked on a sunny Austrian afternoon.
When we sit down we are informed by the server that Austrian law requires that allergy information be printed on the menu alongside every dish. And so it is, in excruciating detail with a legend down by the bottom of the page listing every conceivable food item that you can be allergic to. A short while later, dish after dish of pre-starters pour out of the kitchen. As we start to go through them we realise a curious alignment with the legend at the bottom of the menu. Displaying a decidedly non-Austrian sense of humour, the restaurant has used the allergy information that they are required to include on the menu as the inspiration for each of the starters.
I’m not sure how it got to be like that but I get the distinct feeling that the chef draws a lot of his inspiration from bees and honey. And it starts with the char that is cooked (by the side of our table) in molten beeswax. I’ve seen a number of table-side preparations and been to my share of molecular magic side-shows but this was a truly impressive (unexpectedly so) performance. The char fillets are placed carefully in a nondescript wooden tray. They then pour molten beeswax into the tray till it completely covers the fish. Before our eyes the fillets begin to change colour from their normal translucent state to the opaque white that we are accustomed to seeing.
They give it about 15 minutes and then gently ease the fish out of the beeswax that has now hardened solid. The fish pops out whole and perfectly cooked. They take it away to do some magic in the kitchen and it comes to the table beautifully plated with a long carrot and some sour cream.
They aren’t stingy with their vegetables at Stierereck and for someone who really likes his meat that can sometimes come in the way. Hidden somewhere under the many layers of coloured bell peppers and melon was some Venus clam and I was darned if I could find it. That apart the dish tasted exquisite with many layers of flavour and texture from the mild sweetness of the peppers and melon, to the mouthfeel of Jerusalem artichokes all tied in with the oily overtones of macadamia and black olives.
They followed this up with a mini garden of herbs, porcini mushrooms, green verbena leaves and nuts that I have to admit was not overwhelming, delicate presentation notwithstanding. It’s a dish I thought they would have done well to leave out of the tasting menu and serve only to the vegetarians (but maybe that is my prejudice showing).
The meal is accompanied by little cards that they stick in a sort of a stand by your plate. It contains a description of the dish you are currently eating – with far more detail than one would get from a traditional restaurant menu. They are also convenient pocket-sized keepsakes of the meal and saved me from requesting a copy of the menu as I always do.
It’s from these little cards that I realised that the Job’s Tears that were referred to in the description of the next course on the menu was more than just a Biblical reference but an actual plant (Coix lacrimal-jobi) that is eaten as a vegetable in China and the Far East. In this dish the Job’s Tears had been crisped up and served in a tiny conical wrap that preserved its crunchy texture. I am a fan of carp so I had no complaints with the fish or in fact the entire dish, which had a distinctly Eastern sensibility – thanks in large part, I am sure, to the flavours of Pandan Oil that tied the entire thing together.
I can’t say I was terribly enthused by the Lamb. It was a good hunk of meat, well cooked, if not particularly well seasoned. I can’t fault the technique except that at a restaurant with these credentials I’d have expected a more tasty serving. I thought the popcorn was a treat – it carried the flavour of coffee (which was interesting) and the vegetables were tasty and crunchy – I particularly liked the grilled baby corn. I learned that the sauce was made from the Scarlet Monarde grown in the Steirereck gardens and that imparted the familiar flavours of bergamot to the dish.
The meat course of the day had to be the Venison. I’m a huge fan of well cooked venison – I like the tender, pliable and succulent texture of the meat as well as characteristic slightly games (in a good way) flavour of the meat. They serve the venison with perfectly cooked half moons of squash, baby artichoke hearts sliced flat and a sauce of orange blossom. All in all an excellent pairing of textures and tastes. Clearly the dish of the day for me.
I can’t say any of the desserts really knocked it out of the park. They were all fruity and seasonal — summery even which was a bit of a contrast to the wet weather outside. But none of them rose to the level of brilliance that I have seen at the best restaurants in the world.
Of the desserts on the table, the prize for prettiness clearly went to the Crepe which was served in a roll of delicate strips of crisp and crunchy batter. Alongside the shredded crepe was a colourful row of violet flowers and a delicious puree of medlar.
I started out by remarking on the subliminal presence of bees and honey that hovers in the background of the meal. As I should have expected, the finale to the meal was a selection from the impressive selection of artisanal honeys available at Steirereck.
They rolled out a trolley that contained racks and racks of different varieties of honey, including a healthy selection of honeycombs. They made a show of opening a small porthole at the side — whereupon we heard a furious buzzing. It took us a moment — a very nervous moment — to realise that this was just a recording and that we were not about to be swarmed by angry bees. The server was knowledgeable — or at least he seemed to be given that I have next to no apiary knowledge to be able to question his claims — and we all selected a few varieties to taste.
But taste was all we could manage. Much as I love raw honey, at the end of a sumptuous meal a few licks of the back of a spoon was all I could manage. What we did taste was, surprisingly, subtly different — the local floral conditions clearly make a difference to the end product. I wish we could have carried a few bottles home.
There is no doubt that Chef Heinz Reitbauer is a master of his ingredients. He has two Michellin Stars, four Toques and a place in The List. The location of the restaurant, inside the large and verdant Stadtpark is unmatched and from pictures on the Internet, I would imagine it would have been even more spectacular on a sunny Austrian summer afternoon.
And it is a good restaurant. Some of the dishes (the molten beeswax char in particular) were imaginative and unique. The use of locally produced ingredients and the quaint connection with honeybees is charming. Not having eaten extensively in the region, I cannot really comment with authority but I will not be putting up any arguments if someone claims it is the best restaurant in Austria.
But is it deserving of its place on the list (which, I should remind you, is down from its highest rank at No. 9 in 2013)? I am not convinced. I have eaten at places far lower down the list that have turned out food that is equally exquisite but done so consistently, course upon course without a hitch.
No. 15? Maybe not.

An Austrian Wildlife Icon
These cute animals are European Ground Squirrels, which I saw whilst on holiday in Vienna.
I hadn’t even heard of them until quite recently. Over the last few years, the British media have been publishing more and more photos of ground squirrels and other wildlife in Vienna. Eventually, I couldn’t resist heading over to Austria to see what was going on for myself.
There are plenty of public parks in Vienna, but, as far as I know, only a couple of them have ground squirrels. All of my photos were taken at the Blumengärten Hirschstetten, which you can get to quite easily by tram.
Visit in spring or summer, and you should have a great chance of seeing the squirrels. I spotted several within minutes of arriving, and one of them ran right up to my feet as if it was welcoming me to the park.
I assume the squirrels are used to people feeding them, although there are signs asking you not to.

Since I am currently in Munich but usually live in Vienna, I would like to highlight the differences between Viennese and Munich residents. At first glance, one might not believe that Munich residents differ so much from Viennese, but a comparison reveals significant differences. Let’s first compare the cities to illustrate the differences.
The most noticeable difference is that Vienna is the capital of Austria, while Munich is “only” a large city in Germany. Munich is slightly smaller than Vienna and has fewer inhabitants. Although Munich has only three-quarters of Vienna’s population, it is three times as wealthy, which is evident in the people.
Usually, the population is divided into three classes: lower, middle, and upper class. In Munich, however, there seems to be no clear middle class, and the upper class appears very snobbish. This does not mean that there is no middle class, but rather that it is less noticeable. You see either people who look wealthy or those who appear poorer. The middle class behaves more subtly and hides in public: they either dress elegantly to appear upper class or wear normal clothes, making them seem poorer. I correct my previous statement and say that the middle class behaves discreetly. Now let’s look at the people in Vienna.
Vienna is divided into districts, but there are only a few districts that clearly represent a social class. Even in the wealthy districts, there are hardly any snobs or visibly rich people. In Vienna, the middle class predominates. Everyone looks as if they earn roughly the same. There are exceptions here as well, just like in Munich.
Although I have strongly criticized Munich here, it is a beautiful city. Of course, there are also unfriendly people in Munich, but I have not encountered any so far. In conclusion, both Munich and Vienna are worth visiting.

The Viennese street names not only serve as orientation in the street network, but they also tell stories and describe the character of the city.
The narrow Hafnersteig leads to the center of the “Fleischmarkt”. It was mentioned for the first time in 1220. Therefore, it’s the oldest meat market in Vienna.
In the basement of the house, that dates from the 17th century, is housed a well-known tavern, the “Yellow Eagle”, later known as “The Golden Eagle.
Learn a little patience. You never know what might be around the corner. Still, around it, there may wait, a new road or a secret gate.
The bakery in “Schönlaternegasse” was well known for its good bread. According to the legend, the basilisk was found in the well of a bakery by a young maid.
The Basilisk a mythological lizard type beast that was supposedly a cross-breeding of a cock, a toad, and a snake.
Georg, one of the baker’s helpers, who was secretly in love with the maid, volunteered to undertake this task to gain the Master’s approval of their marriage plan.
Down in the well, the basilisk looked into the mirror and when he saw how ugly he really was, burst up.
The well was filled in with stones, and our hero Georg married the young maid.
The blocks of houses in the so-called “Blutgassen” quarter in the first district, between Singerstraße, Blutgasse, Grünangergasse, and Domgasse, are among the oldest in Vienna.
Their foundations date back to the 12th century. The buildings erected on them date from the 16th and 17th centuries.
To which circumstance the blood alley (Blutgasse) owes its name has not yet been established. According to the legend, in Medieval times (1312) the Templars (monks) were brutally slaughtered in their courtyard (Fähnrichhof) and the blood ran down the little lane like a stream.
Nearby the St. Stephen’s Cathedral is the small street named Domgasse.
At the address “Domgasse 5” you can visit the only one existing Mozart’s apartments in Vienna. From 1784 to 1787, the composer lived in this Haus with his wife Constanza. During this period, Mozart wrote many works including his opera “The Marriage of Figaro”.
The first documented mention of a house on this property dates back to the 14th century. Since 1458 the bakers have settled in this area. According to the reports, this place is the birthplace of the famous Viennese croissants (Kipferl).
It is very unlikely, however, that this shape did not appear first at 1683 (allegedly to mock the Turks by the chosen shape of a crescent), as we already know that from the 13th century the bakers gave “chipfen” to dignitaries as a Christmas present.
Above the portal, there is a house sign with old pastry molds, which reminds us of the tradition.
From left to right and from top to bottom the following pastries are visible: Bosniakerl, Schusterlaberl, Kipfel, Brezel, Beugel and, a Girafferl.
The southern tower of St. Stephen’s Cathedral (136.7 m) is, without doubt, the main landmark of the city of Vienna.
Tradition speaks for Rudolf IV as the founder of the tower, the duke himself has laid the foundation stone in 1368. Its construction lasted 65 years, from 1368 to 1433.
At that time the south tower was the highest tower Europa’s, meanwhile, it’s between the top ten church buildings. The tallest church is in Ulm, Germany (161,5 m.)
During the Austria — Hungary monarchy no building was allowed to be built higher than St. Stephen’s Cathedral.

You know that feeling when a song hits you right in the gut? Like, it wasn’t just made for you, but like it somehow knew what you needed to hear before you even did? That’s what “Vienna” by Billy Joel did to me.
I came across that song again during my drive home, on a random night just a few weeks ago, when I was overanalyzing my life, my future, and whether I’m already too late to do something meaningful. The classic mid-to-late 20s spiral, you know? One minute I’m driving slowly through the city, the next I’m questioning my entire existence.
Then, boom; “Vienna waits for you”.
I don’t know what it is about that line, but it unlocked something in me. I’ve never thought about, let alone visited Vienna. Maybe it’s the gentle piano intro. Maybe it’s the way Billy sings it like a wise old friend sitting next to me at 3AM, telling me to breathe.
“Slow down, you crazy child. You’re so ambitious for a juvenile.”
I felt exposed. How dare he come for my entire personality like that? But also, he’s right. I am ambitious. I’ve always wanted to get things done fast, prove myself, complete all the milestones before I hit my imaginary deadline. And lately, that mindset has been eating at me. I kept thinking, “Why don’t I have everything figured out yet?”
But Vienna reminds me that I don’t have to. I’m still young. A 26 year-old is basically a 6 year-old in the “adult” life. And “youth” doesn’t mean I have to hustle 24/7. It means I have time to figure things out. It means I can still dream big without burning out trying to make it happen as fast as possible.
There’s something deeply comforting about being told that it’s okay to not be in a rush. We don’t get that a lot. Being told that success doesn’t expire at 30. That if I haven’t landed my dream job, or released that album, or written that book yet, it doesn’t mean I have failed. It just means I’m still on my way.
And that’s more than okay.
“Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.”
That line gets me every time. Because that fire, yes. I have felt it. I still feel it. The desire to do something great, to not waste time. But sometimes, that fire turns into anxiety. Into comparison. Into restlessness. And this song basically told me, “Hey, chill. You have time. You’re doing fine.”
Lately, every time I get overwhelmed about the future or about the feeling like I’m not doing enough, I put this song on. And for those three and a half minutes, I always feel like the noise quiets down. I remember that life isn’t a race. That I don’t have to catch up to anyone. That I’m allowed to take detours, to pause, to just… be.
And beyond all that, the song just feels beautiful. The melody is gentle, a little wistful, but hopeful. It’s not sad. It’s patient. Like Vienna itself, whatever it symbolizes, it can wait. It’s not going anywhere. And neither is my worth.
I think the main thing that Vienna taught me is: I’m not late. I’m not behind. I’m exactly where I need to be. And sometimes, slowing things down is the most powerful thing I can do.
Because Vienna waits for me.
And that’s more than enough.

I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train.
We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars (they didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing).
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: Tell me about your dad.
Me: Jeez, I don’t really like talking about him.
Caroline: I can tell. But still… Try.
Me: Ok, tell me when to stop. He was a real piece of shit. Aside from being a 500 lbs. shut-in, he was a manipulative, habitual liar. Everything he did, he did in the name of self-interest. He smelled like literal shit and piss, and only got dressed a few times a year, usually for doctor appointments. His legs were so big, they were ripping open. He’d secretly order food then bury the remains deep in the trash. He was addicted to pornography (I found out after he died, when I was looking through his computer). When my girlfriend called the house, he’d listen in then deny it. I could always hear him breathing because he’d forget to press mute.
I have zero happy memories of him and prayed for his death for almost 10 years. He used to stay up all night, whaling and crying in the basement (where he lived), prompting me to cover all the vents with pillows. One time a friend heard him from outside and asked me if there was a dying animal in the house. There was, but I couldn’t admit it. During his final moments, when he pled to me for forgiveness, I did not absolve him or try to make him feel any better. I told him to be quiet, that his time had passed. When he died, I didn’t cry or feel sad, only relieved. His memory haunt me forever.
Caroline: Ok. That was a lot.
Me: I know.
Caroline: Is that why you use drugs?
Me: Hmm, I guess?
At the time I didn’t realize the direct connection between my mourning process and my drug use. I was still in the denial phase, and not in the sense of I couldn’t believe he died, rather, I was denying my own feelings. I’d done so much mourning while he was still alive that I’d assumed that part was done with. It was not. Drugs helped me cope with that, without me even realizing. Adderall kept me focused and productive, weed prevented me from being angry all the time, and alcohol allowed me not to care about life in general. Because of my regimented nature, I needed them all, every day, in the same amount, at the same times. Being a drug addict, more than anything, made life tolerable. I could focus on one thing: getting high, and not worry about all my sadness and pent-up anger.
We arrived in Vienna with no plans, and nowhere to stay, so we walked around the city center looking for a hostel. When we got tired of carrying our bags, we stopped in a bar to rest and ask for directions. Before Google and Yelp, it was bartenders who could tell you about every business within a 5-mile radius. “Don’t go to that one. Go to this one. Ask for Ron. Tell him I sent you.” There’s very little of that anymore.
The music disturbed me as soon as we walked in.
Me: What is this hot garbage they’re playing.
Caroline: It sounds like David Hasselhoff.
Me: You’re not going to believe this, but, in America there’s an actor with the same name. He’s on a show called Baywatch. Isn’t that crazy?
Caroline: Are you being serious right now?
Me: Yeah, the same exact name.
Caroline: IT’S THE SAME PERSON.
Me: Wait… So, he’s a musician too?
Caroline: He’s the most popular artist in Germany and Austria. He’s put out more than 20 albums.
Me: Are you sure there aren’t two of them?
Caroline: Also, we have Baywatch in Australia. I don’t live on the moon.
I was more dumbfounded than embarrassed. Regardless, his music was terrible, like a cheesier version of Depeche Mode. When I walked over to the Jukebox to put an end to it, I was shocked to find that all the albums were Hasselhoff. It was a fucking Hasselhoff bar. I felt like I was on a bad acid trip. We had one drink, as to not be rude, and while doing so met a few fellow backpackers. They were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner, and offered to take us there. To our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point. It had a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and my Adderall supply was dwindling. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of energy too.
That night we shared a couple bottles of wine (that was considered “not drinking” for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, (the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border), along with some ultra-thin paper to match, and I wanted to put them to use. (I love thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in your hand. My favorite type of paper when I was a kid was tracing paper. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers would tell me I couldn’t. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular lined paper and crumple it before writing on it. It made it softer. I don’t know why that mattered to me so much, but I bet it’s the same reason I don’t like museums.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far. Pat was, and still is, my best friend. He was the one I confided in after my dad died, and the first person I told the whole messy story to. He helped me mourn and continues to. I don’t know where I’d be without him.
Here’s an excerpt:
…You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It wasn’t that bad (it was). I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She has a great ass, in addition to being an awesome person. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
I told her about you, and she said to send her regards. We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though. Speaking of which, tell your mom I say hi. I hope your weird, home-schooled, born-again Christian girlfriend is magically becoming less lame, but I doubt it…
There were only a few beds available when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. After giving her a kiss, I said goodnight and went my own way. Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. If I’d had multiple outfits, I would have laid one out in anticipation.
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught her the rules of chess. She’d never played before, and though I wasn’t that good, I enjoyed teaching people how to play. Kevin taught me how to play. He’s beat me every single time then say something nice like “wow you’re so good now.” It only pissed me off more, though he meant it.
We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be. I could tell how much Caroline enjoyed feeling me press up against her. At one point she reached behind me to pull me closer, and I got an erection.
Me: I never thought I’d get a boner while playing chess.
Caroline: What is wrong with you?
Me: It’s a natural reaction to friction.
Caroline: Jesus, that’s not what I meant. Why do you say these things out loud?
Me: Isn’t that just part of my charm?
Caroline: I guess so, Mr. McEnroe. I guess so.
We went to a museum that afternoon but for the life of me I cannot remember which one, or what was inside. It could have been dinosaur bones or art; I have no clue. Museums are all the same to me, just a bunch of shit you can’t touch.
A Mitch Hedberg joke comes to mind…
“I was at a craft fair and there was a jar of Jellybeans. The guy said, ‘Guess how many Jellybeans are in the jar, and win a prize’. Aw, come on man, let me just have some.”
I mean, I want to party, not look at a party.
I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards bought a sausage with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few families laughed and pointed. When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about weed, I would have gotten high earlier.
While wondering around, we passed a skateboard shop that was loudly playing Raekwon’s, “Verbal Intercourse,” perhaps my favorite Wu-adjacent song. It pulled me in like a magnet. The Asian dude behind the counter gave us a welcoming look as soon as we walked in.
Me: Yo, I love this song.
Guy: Me too. He’s going to be at The Melkveg in Amsterdam next week. You going?
Me: I didn’t know about it, but I am now.
Guy: I’m going too. Maybe I’ll see you there.
Me: Hell yeah.
Guy: Do you need weed?
Drugs always find me.
Me: I do. Do you sell it?
He reached under the counter and pulled out a backpack filled with nearly a pound of weed.
Guy: I do.
He broke out a scaled and weighed 4 grams.
Guy: Will this get you to Amsterdam?
Me: You’d better double it.
Guy: Ha, ok. I feel you.
After making the exchange, we chatted for a few minutes. He asked me where I was from, and when I told him I’d just come from Brooklyn, he couldn’t believe how close I lived to the Wu-Tang Clan.
Guy: Have you ever been to Staten Island?
Me: No one not from Staten Island has ever been to Staten Island.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She’d made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet. We decided on a place called The Chapel Bar. It was a little more up-scale than the pubs we’d been going to, but shit, we were going on a date. Why not class it up?
When we got there around 8pm we were the only ones in the place. The entire bar was empty, the tables and booths too. The bartender welcomed us like he’d been waiting for company and waved us over to the bar. He looked visibly disappointed when we beelined for a booth. Neither of us were in the mood for small talk, so each time we needed drinks, I walked up to the bar to order. It became increasingly awkward with each trip, so I started ordering in bunches, which seemed to only bother him more. We were taking shots of Caroline’s favorite drink, Sambuca, my least favorite. “You have to drink it,” she told me, “It’s named after you.”
We got really drunk really fast, and after a few rounds we were making out at the table. The bartender gave us nasty “get a room” looks, but we ignored him. Then I devised a plan, one that has been devised many a time before, but never by me.
Me: Meet me in the bathroom.
I said it with confidence. It didn’t require a response. It was a command.
When she burst in, I pulled her pants down and put her in the sink, something I hadn’t premeditated. I was in a flow state.
I don’t care to divulge all the details of the experience, but I will say that there was no penetration. We got each other off, but didn’t cross that line. It was an unspoken agreement we had. Plus, I didn’t have a condom, and I was militant about using them. I’d go limp if I didn’t have one on. I know, weird.
After getting ourselves together, we exited the bathroom, where we were greeted by the bartender, who was holding our bill, visibly furious. I paid it, standing in front of the bathroom door, and we ran out, laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, at least in my experience. Caroline was laughing. She had no shame. I took her back and we chugged water in the waiting room.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean tonight?
Caroline: No, I mean “us”. Like, tonight we go to bed, and never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: What if we end up in the same place again?
Caroline: Then we can pick up right where we left off.
Me: Should we exchange emails?
Caroline: No.
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Exactly.
Me: (Kissing her cheek) Ok, goodbye Caroline.
Caroline: Goodbye Johnny Mac.
At the time I wasn’t sure if she was trying to get rid of me, or what her motivations were. Now I realize it had to do with timing (timing is everything). She knew when to get offstage. It was me that wanted an encore. Man, she was cool.

The Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons, dubbed “Humanity at the Crossroads,” addressed the urgent need to regulate deadly autonomous weapons systems. As a youth delegate, I gained valuable insights into this critical issue. Here’s a snapshot of what I learned:
Understanding the Big Picture
The conference shed light on the serious challenges posed by autonomous weapons. They could make conflicts worse, harm civilians, and disrupt efforts to keep peace worldwide.
Why Human Control Matters
A key lesson was the importance of humans staying in charge of decisions about using force. Letting machines make life-or-death choices raises big moral and legal questions. We need clear rules to make sure people are responsible and to stop these weapons from causing harm.
Talking Ethics
We spent time discussing what’s right and wrong when it comes to autonomous weapons. We talked about how to respect people’s dignity and protect them from these weapons’ dangers. We also thought about how using these weapons might change society in the long run and change our relationship with technology.
Challenges We Face
Even though many people agree on the need for rules, there are still big challenges ahead. Some powerful governments and tech companies control a lot of the conversation. It’s tough for other voices, like from everyday people and community groups, to be heard.
Youth Power
Young people like us played a big part in the conference. Our fresh ideas and energy showed how important it is to get everyone involved in the discussion to address autonomous weapons. We left feeling inspired and ready to push for change in our communities.
What Comes Next
The conference wasn’t just talk, it was a call to action. We agreed to work even harder to establish strong global rules for autonomous weapons. But it won’t happen overnight. We need to keep up the pressure and work together to make real change.
In sum, the Vienna Conference on Autonomous Weapons was a chance to learn, share ideas, and get ready for action. We learned how crucial it is to keep humans in control of decisions about life and death in warfare. As we move forward, let’s stay focused on making the world safer and fairer for everyone.

“Be a fool. For love. For yourself.” -Bourdain
I was done with buses after my previous experience, Caroline knew that. So, even though it was a short trip, we opted for the train. We sat in the bar car, drinking Guinness and smoking cigs for the entirety of the 60-minute ride. Caroline smoked Marlboro Lights; I smoked Parliament Regulars. They didn’t sell lights anywhere in Europe, which drove me mad. You’d think the two would taste and smoke similarly, but they don’t, not even close. It’s like if Coke tasted like Coke, and Diet Coke tasted like lemonade. Very confusing.
Things naturally became a bit more personal now that we were alone.
Caroline: How are you doing since your dad died? Wanna let anything out?
Me: Well… I’m doing terrible, actually. He left me with all this pain and anger I don’t deserve or know what to do with. I thought he’d take it with him when he died, but somehow, he transferred it to me, and now I feel worse than I did when he was alive. If I’d known I’d feel this way in the end, I wouldn’t have cared about him so much; I wouldn’t have spent my whole life concerned about his health. What was the fucking point? Why did I put myself through all that when I didn’t have to?
Caroline: Sam, you learned how to be empathetic, and compassionate. You care about people deeply, that’s very rare. Those are all wonderful qualities you should be proud of. You took on responsibilities that no child should have to take on, but they only made you stronger, whether you see it now or not. Death is a part of life, and it sounds like you looked it right in the eye. It’s an experience you’ll cherish one day. I believe that. With time, the pain will ease, and you’ll begin to see the experience in a different light. Trust me.
Me: How do you know this?
Caroline: I’m an owl.
Me: So, what do I do in the meantime, until the pain eases?
Caroline: I don’t know, just keep hopping around. You’ll figure it out.

While having a drink, we met a few fellow backpackers who were staying at a nearby hostel, the Vienna Hostel Ruthensteiner. They kindly walked us there, and to our delight, there were rooms still available.
It was the nicest hostel I’d seen up until that point, like almost hotel-level nice. There was a large kitchen with a dining room, a recreation atrium, and a courtyard with one of those life-sized chess boards where you lug the pieces from square to square. The only thing it didn’t have was a bar, which was just fine with me because I needed to lay low for a few days. My circuits had begun to fry, and I was ahead of my planned Adderall pace because I was too kind to Simon. What I needed more than anything was rest. Caroline felt the same. She’d been on the road for four weeks and was running out of juice too.
That night we shared a few bottles of wine (that was considered not drinking for me) and wrote letters to our friends back home. I’d bought some vintage airmail envelopes in Amsterdam, the blue ones with red and white stripes around the border, along with some ultra-thin paper, and I wanted to put them to use. I LOVE thin paper; there’s something about the way it feels in my hand. As a kid, tracing paper was my jam. I’d try to do my assignments on it, but teachers wouldn’t let me. As an act of rebellion, I’d take regular notebook paper and crumple it to make it softer.
I wrote Pat a letter, recounting my trip so far.
Aye,
You won’t believe me, but I jizzed while looking into a pimp’s eyes. It was as bad as you think it would be, maybe worse. I also have a travel girlfriend; her name is Caroline. We’re in Vienna together. I never thought I’d have a first date in a new country, but here we are. She isn’t Meghan, but then again, who is?
We may have sex tonight; I can feel it. The anticipation is even better than the act, though, is it not? I have no clue where I’m going next, or if Caroline will be traveling with me, but I’m thinking Germany because it’s not too far away. Then Spain. That long ride is going to be a motherfucker though.
I talked to Caroline about my dad’s death yesterday. She, you, and 2 random ladies I met in Paris are the only ones who know how I’ve been feeling. I’m trying my hardest to share, but I don’t want to be a constant downer, ya know? Caroline told me it’ll get easier, like you did, but I just hope I’m not too far gone before the tide turns. Her brother died tragically, but she has more perspective than me because she’s an owl. I’m a frog, by the way. I’ll explain later.
I told Caroline about you, and she said to send her regards. So… Regards. I miss you, man. See you on the flip side.
Sam
The place was nearly full when we checked in, so unfortunately Caroline and I couldn’t stay in the same room. We each had to take a single bed in one that was already occupied. So, after kissing goodnight, we parted ways.
Lying in bed, I felt like a high schooler, excited to see my girlfriend by the lockers the next morning. God, what an amazing feeling that was… Walking the halls before school, passing by your crush’s locker over and over, trying to make your meeting seem unplanned. “Oh me, I was just going to chemistry. Funny seeing you here,” you say, as if you’re not mentally orgasming. If they made a drug to capture that feeling, we’d all be addicted.
April 8, 2006
The next morning, we had breakfast together in the courtyard. While eating, I taught Caroline the rules of chess. Kevin was the one who taught me how to play. He’d beat me every single time then say something nice like “you’re really improving.” It only pissed me off more, but he meant it. We played one practice game with takebacks so she could get used to playing on her own. I stood behind her and helped her move the large pieces, rubbing up on her in the process the way a pervy golf instructor would. I wasn’t slick, but I didn’t have to be.

I popped out for a joint at one point, and afterwards I bought a sausage accompanied with mustard so spicy it shot out my nose when I coughed. A few teens laughed and pointed while I poured water on my face to cool down. One kid called me a “Mus-tard.” I’ll never forget that little bastard.
When I went back inside, I wreaked of weed so Caroline said it was time to go. I didn’t argue. In fact, if I’d known how self-conscious she was about the smell of weed, I would have gotten high much earlier. I’ve always enjoyed spreading weed smoke to the masses. If you don’t like the smell, too bad. I don’t like your smell either.
That night Caroline and I met in the common area for our date. She made minestrone soup for us to fill up on so we could save our money for drinks. My high school crush, Laura, loved minestrone soup too. Maybe I’m just attracted to the Minestrone gene. When we were done, we searched for a place to drink using the hostel’s free internet.

Caroline: Do you have a condom?
Me: Shit, I don’t.
Caroline: You didn’t get one?
Me: I forgot.
Then, we heard a knock at the door.
Bartender: We don’t allow fucking in here. Come out now or I’m coming in.
We scrambled to put our clothes back on, then I opened the door. The bartender was still standing there, bill in hand.
Bartender: I added a cleaning fee. Pay now and go.
I handed him whatever money I had on me, then Caroline and I ran out laughing hysterically.
On the walk back to the hostel, we smoked a joint and Caroline threw up. I expected to be the one puking, on account of the Sambuca, but it was Caroline heaving on the side of the road. I held her hair back. Most women cry when they’re wasted and vomiting, but Caroline laughed. She had no shame. Mid-vomit she posed a very serious question.
Caroline: Don’t you think we should end on a high note?
Me: You mean, tonight? This doesn’t seem like a very high note.
Caroline: No, I mean “us.” Like, tonight we go to bed, and we never see each other again. We just go on our separate ways when we wake up. I want to remember you like this.
Me: Holding your hair back while you vomit?
Caroline: No. I mean, before we complicate things. I want you to live in my mind as a perfect memory.
Me: It’s not because you don’t want to have sex with me, right?
Caroline: I very much want to have sex with you. It isn’t about that. It’s about preserving a special memory and locking it away in a little box that you can peek in whenever you want. I want you just like this.
Me: I could use a box with something nice in it… Right now, I only have ones I want to keep shut.
Caroline: You see what I’m saying?
Me: So, this would be it, forever?
Caroline: Yeah.
Me: What if we end up seeing each other again in another country?
Caroline: Then it was meant to be.
Me: Fair enough, pretty lady.
Caroline: Goodbye, my sweet Johnny Mac.
Me: Goodbye, Caroline.
I walked her to her room, gave her a kiss on the cheek, and that was it. She flew away the next morning, leaving me to hop around on my own, with my little box.

In praise of 15 minute cities: Why a ‘city of short distances’ feels better.
“People realised the state of their neighbourhoods could change. They could enjoy life in front of their front doors without owning a garden, without having a balcony,” said Vienna’s former Deputy Mayor, Maria Vassilakou.
Rated no.1 in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Global Liveability Index, Vienna frequently places as one of the world’s top cities to live in. And while it’s never explicitly called a 15- or 20-minute city, it nevertheless responds to the social, technological and ecological challenges that we all face.
Described as “the city of short distances”, urban planning policy in the city has long put pedestrians first (since the 80s, in fact). And, a few decades down the line, the results are evident everywhere: pavement expansions, improvements to public transport connectivity, sports provision and — notably — the longest continuous pedestrianised space in Europe, in the form of shopping street Mariahilferstraße.
Vienna feels equitable and inclusive, too. It’s affordable, for starters. And a focus on gender mainstreaming, a strategy adopted to achieve gender equality in society, has translated to things like fully illuminated footpaths, more entrances and exits to parks, grants for neighbourhood open space, and additional premiums for research conducted by women — a real-world commitment to urban planning that’s led by the needs and safety of citizens.
LIVEABILITY SCORE: 8/10. A compact and connected city geared towards pedestrians, safety and people-first infrastructure.

I’ve now been living in Vienna about a year and a half (my how time flies!).
I’ve seen so much so far but there are a couple of places I didn’t get to until today.
We’ve had very cold weather the past week or so, down to close to freezing temps at night, and so walking around or exploring isn’t exactly what one wants to do.
Today is a glorious sunny (and finally warm) day so I headed to the center to take in two beautiful and interesting historical places.
Kaiserliche Schatzkammer
First I went to the Imperial Treasury (Kaiserliche Schatzkammer) which is part of the large Hofburg palace complex the emperors of Austria lived in.
I highly recommend purchasing tickets online before you go. While today’s line wasn’t too long, in spite of the plethora of tourists in town, you can just walk right in and get your online ticket scanned to enter without having to wait for than a few seconds.
You enter a few darkened rooms which contain all kinds of imperial and church artifacts, such as crowns, robes, orbs and the like. It’s not that big but you do learn a lot about Austrian history throughout the ages and also the growth and collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian empire over the centuries.

Congratulations! You managed to make the girl who didn’t believe in love fall for you.
You made her believe the two of you shared something special, something meant to be.
You made her feel like you’d never truly hurt her.
She had her doubts, but they were born out of fear — fear because she loved you so much that she couldn’t imagine life without you.
She thought she was just being protective of her heart, until one day, all her fears became reality.
She watched the man she loved with her whole heart hurt her and let her down.
Seeing you talk to your ex, sounding so happy, broke something deep inside her.
Every “I love you” and “I promise” now feels like empty words.
She wonders how someone who says they love you could hurt you so deeply, break your trust, and make you feel like a fool for believing in them.
And yet, she stays.
She tries to work through it because she doesn’t want to give up on you.
But your words are starting to cut deeper than you realize.
She’s “too emotional,” a “pick me,” or just the “sad girl.”
The person she once felt so close and safe with now feels like a stranger.
She’s scared to be herself, scared to open up. Her heart no longer feels safe with the man she loves.
The worst part?
There’s still nothing she wouldn’t do for you. She’d destroy herself emotionally a million times over if it meant making you happy.

Until I arrived at the airport, I could believe this was indeed happening and that it was not a dream anymore. It has been three years since my last travelling on holiday, and since then, I have been longing for the day that I could travel again.
On the flight to my destination, I imagined what would happen on this holiday and recalled my last memory on a flight. Who could imagine the world would have a massive change in such a short period?
After a two-and-a-half-hour flight from the UK, I arrived at my destination, Vienna. I have always wanted to visit Vienna. As the capital city of Austria, voted as one of the safest cities in Europe, which is best for solo travelling, like what I am doing.
“You must visit Schoenbrunn Palace. It is one of the most impressive landmarks in Vienna,” said my father. Before going on the trip, many people told me the same thing.
After 20 minute ride on the metro, I arrived at Schoenbrunn station. Once leaving the station…

The first time I heard Vienna by Billy Joel, I was on a train home after college, the world outside dipped in the amber light of a tired evening. I had just bombed an interview I had poured my soul into. My head was a whirlwind of spiralling doubts — about my future, about whether I had what it takes, about everything. And then Vienna arrived — not like a pop anthem or an uplifting chorus, but like a friend who sits with you in silence and tells you exactly what you need to hear.
“Slow down, you crazy child
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you’re so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid?”
In that moment, tears welled up — not because of the failure, but because of how deeply the song understood the ache behind it. How it met me in the in-between, where so many of us live: driven but unsure, hopeful but exhausted.
That lyric wasn’t just about me. It was about a generation raised to hustle, to quantify their worth through grades, internships, side projects, and glowing LinkedIn posts. I had come to think of life as a ladder. But Vienna whispered of a different metaphor — a garden, perhaps. Something that grows in time, with pauses, with pruning, with seasons of bloom and rest.
It reminded me of The Midnight Library by Matt Haig — a book about a woman who, burdened by regret, stumbles upon a mystical library containing infinite versions of her life. Each book in the library reveals a different path she could have taken. The novel forces you to ask: what if the life you’re racing toward isn’t the one that would’ve made you happy? What if the pauses, the missed exits, the so-called failures, are the very fabric of the life meant for you?
“When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?”
In Joel’s metaphor, Vienna isn’t a destination you rush to. It’s the life that waits — patiently, quietly — for you to stop sprinting long enough to hear its music. It’s the version of you that grows not by doing more, but by understanding what enough feels like. That revelation mirrored the essence of The Midnight Library: the idea that you’re not a failure just because you’re not on someone else’s timeline.
The truth is, I didn’t need a new plan that day on the train. I needed perspective. I needed someone — or something — to tell me that I hadn’t missed my moment, that there are many doors yet to open. And Vienna, in its tender, piano-laced wisdom, did exactly that.
“You can get what you want or you can just get old
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through”
Those words haunted me. Because I had never thought of burnout as a kind of death. But that’s what it is: the death of wonder, of joy, of being here. I was chasing a life so hard that I was forgetting to live the one already unfolding around me.
Billy Joel’s Vienna didn’t just soften my ambition — it redefined it. It told me that ambition rooted in fear is a form of imprisonment. But ambition rooted in patience? In stillness? That’s purpose. That’s wisdom.
So now, when I feel that panic — that rising tide of “not enough,” of “too late,” of “what am I doing with my life?” — I don’t drown. I return to the song. To Joel’s voice, gently guiding me back.
“Slow down, you’re doing fine.”
And just like the woman in The Midnight Library learns: the life you’re meant to live isn’t the one with the loudest applause. It’s the one where you’re fully alive. The one that waits for you — just like Vienna.

On the title page of Red Vienna, a new novel by Eve Neuhaus, she opens with a quote:
In the dark times,Will there be singing? — Bertolt Brecht
This poignant question resonates deeply, especially given that Neuhaus’s novel is set in Vienna during the years leading up to the Anschluss — the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany on March 13, 1938. These were indeed “dark times,” and Brecht’s words evoke the struggle for hope amidst adversity.
Interestingly, Bertolt Brecht’s sentiment may have inspired similar reflections in modern music. The British group Ultravox released their iconic song “Vienna” in 1980, echoing themes of darkness and longing. Some of their lyrics vividly capture this sense of foreboding:
Walked in the cold airFreezing breath on a window pane…A man in the dark in a picture frameA voice reaching out in a piercing cry…Oh Vienna(Songwriters…

Things that I’m a sucker for while traveling: a unique building, a nice park, and a spooky cemetery. I will go out of my way to see these. Even if it means traveling across an entire city.
So years ago, when I was traveling in Vienna with my parents, that’s exactly what I did. I had heard about this cool building, called Hundertwasserhaus.
Although I was in my 30s, living on my own in a foreign country, and had traveled around the world, my mom didn’t want me to go alone. So she tagged along.
It’s curved, it’s straight, it’s a building, and it’s a garden.
Hundertwasserhaus is hard to describe, but it overloads your mind when you see it. There is so much to look at.
It is a colorful, eclectic apartment building. It was built in the 1980s with multiple styles and built on different planes. The windows are different sizes. The facade changes from stucco to trompe l’oeil to brick to mosaic. The street level boasts unusual, non-uniform colorful columns.
Trees pop out of the building in unexpected places. The artist called these trees on the building “tree tenants.”

→ Vienna
By 1938, America, England, Canada, Australia and most other countries had either tightened immigration intake or outright banned foreigners. Apparently a Mr. Rogers, an Australian businessman, was visiting Vienna in 1938 and somehow met our family. He offered to help and assisted my father applying for a visa to Australia, sponsoring us. The application was refused. Mr. Rogers subsequently wrote telling my father that stating to be a tradesman as a “chauffeur” was the worst entry possible as his son, aged 17, “could drive a car better than you can!” That was the end of that.
The Depression had not lifted entirely in most of the Western world. In any case, the few who did receive visas to desired country destinations had to have sums of money my father did not possess. My grandfather’s business, in which my father and his brother Walter worked, barely supported the family. This was not entirely due to economic conditions — it has been attributed largely to my grandfather’s second marriage to a beautiful woman some 30 years younger than himself. She apparently required a new house with the best trimmings.
Jews who didn’t make it to desired country destinations had the possibility of buying passports for entry to South American countries like Argentina and Uruguay. Switzerland was open only to the super rich, and then only as permanent ‘tourists’. Refugees like my parents, who left matters too late with very little money, found safety in the few destinations that made no demands. There was Shanghai, Trinidad, Curacao, and small black African states. Israel, Palestine in those days, was quite sealed against Jewish immigration by British decree, although several hundred young people entered and were smuggled in right throughout the war.
You didn’t need an entry visa, you just had to get there.
My parents found a way to Shanghai, as did about 19,000 Jewish refugees from Hitler. A temporary “Thru-visa” was available from Italy. This was issued on sight of a steamship ticket to Shanghai purchased from Italian line Lloyd Triestino, on one of the boats that steamed a regular route from Genoa to Shanghai, for an exorbitant sum. Only First Class tickets were available as a matter of course. I don’t know how but this sum was found for the Hahn family of 2 adults and a child. Train tickets were purchased to Genoa.
I remember a young girl, about my age, boarded the train with us. I never learned what was the family’s relationship to us, but my parents agreed to take her along. She was taken off the train at the border between Austria and Italy during the night, I presume because she was without papers. I have never been told what became of her and I have since often wondered whether she was returned to Vienna and her parents safely.
After a few days in Genoa we embarked on the mv. Victoria, the smallest but newest of the Lloyd Triestino fleet that sailed to the Orient regularly. We owned several ‘cabin trunks’ full of possessions and 114 British pounds. The voyage was a great delight for my parents, despite what must have been anxiety for the future. The mv. Victoria was the smallest ship in the line, but the latest and most modern.
First class service in all respects was still pre-war and luxurious. The voyage was very romantic, landing at exotic ports along the way. In Port Said, at the southern end of the Suez Canal, a great fête was held with native dancers and a feast was prepared on the dock. I believe it was an Egyptian version of an Aussie barbecue with whole beasts being cooked. Local citizens were present as well as the ship’s passengers. I was allowed down to the wharf for a little while and then taken to the cabin to sleep. I never learned why the celebration. I cannot remember the landing in Bombay or the three days passed in Singapore. Then came Hong Kong and lastly Shanghai.

The day that i actually listened and absorb the lyrics of the song “vienna” by billy joel, it hits. That song represents me so much, the things i couldn’t put into words, that song represents exactly how i feel. I’ve always constantly running nonstop, wonder when will it ends, i’m so exhausted, everyday is a constant battles i have to get through. One line from that song that cuts deep was “only fools are satisfied” cause i slowly realizes that i kept begging for validations from everyone around me even the ones i barely knew, i kept doing what they perhaps wanting me to do so that they’ll like me and i can finally be in peace but that’s not what happens instead i felt more empty and sad for myself, letting myself go through all those things just to be accepted and liked. Why am i running? why am i rushing? what am i searching for? why do i keep doing this to myself? for whom? for what? i’m still questioning myself those questions and still haven’t found the answers. What i do know is i want this to stop, i want to live FOR me, vienna waits for me, i’m WAITING for ME, to finally be happy with who i am without the need of other people acceptance.

Vienna is one of several European capitals that I’ve personally visited many times, and it’s also one of the most visited cities in Europe and the entire world.
The picturesque Austrian capital is renowned to be one of the most liveable cities in the world, and for some very good reasons!
From a personal perspective, I already know 3 people from my little tiny country (Luxembourg) that studied in the city and subsequently decided to never leave the place and start a new life there. From all over the world people flock to Vienna, either for tourism or to move there permanently.
But what are the reasons that make Vienna such a globally recognized hotspot to live in? What makes Vienna so special in regard to other European capital cities?
Having visited the city on 4 separate occasions, I will today line out my 5 personal reasons why Vienna is considered the most liveable city in Europe, and why it is up there with the most liveable cities in the world.

I didn’t go to Vienna with a checklist. No Schönbrunn palace on the agenda. No museums lined up by hour. Just three slow-moving days, a waterproof camera backpack, and a promise to myself not to overthink it.
From the airport, I caught the 10.5€ bus to Westbahnhof and checked into a small guesthouse nearby. Quiet street. Solid sleep. Five-minute walk to most things that mattered.
I skipped the palaces and headed straight to a corner market for a mustard-soaked pretzel and a table with no view. I sat longer than I meant to. It was a good start.
I stumbled across the Musikverein just before noon. No grand performance, just a chamber rehearsal in the golden hall. I sat in the back. Stayed through most of it.
Across the square, the House of Music pulled me in by accident. I don’t usually do interactive museums, but this one surprised me. No pressure to move quickly. No crowds. Just quiet sound rooms layered like dreams.
Later, I caught the U-Bahn to Donauinsel, found a bench by the river, and watched the clouds shift. It started to rain lightly, but everything stayed dry — my gear, my layers — all tucked into that camera backpack I almost didn’t bring.
I walked aimlessly in the city centre, ducked into St. Peter’s Church, and followed the scent of coffee to K.u.K. Heiner. It felt more imperial than the cakes themselves — but the atmosphere was enough.
Dinner was at Neubauschenke: pork stew, beef broth, locals in padded vests. I sat near the back and scribbled some notes. Later, Papaya served me one of the better duck salads I’ve had in Europe. Spicy, fast, no English menu — perfect.
I didn’t plan this trip, and it still worked.
Because Vienna is good to people who walk slowly, who sit a little longer, and who carry light.
If you’re thinking of going, don’t overpack. A lightweight waterproof camera backpack will do. The rest, the city gives you.

These days, I’ve been listening to some songs that boost my solitudes. I don’t know why but life more filled with peace and its own passion when we can deeply connected with small things around us. When we feel everything in a sense and deeply. Life turns out being way more meaningful rather than when we didn’t try to noticed small things and took it as a meaningless things. Lately, choosing to just slow down and trying not to be that ‘too ambitious’ for each steps of lives that surely stills unknown. I realized that it’s alright to not ‘rush’ everything at the same time. Not every single things supposed to be rushed.
One of Billy Joel’s song that can portray so much towards this writing is “Vienna”, and I’ve been listening to it on repeat. I tried to connect myself to the song entirely, turns out its that song that we all needed as a person who’s just entering early of adulthood. That it’s alright to disappear for awhile or as long as you want when things are seems so tough for you to carry on. That why don’t us try to slow down and just enjoy every little good things in our lives with passion and pride? What are we afraid for? As long as we can choose to slow down and take times to not rush each goals of our lives.
Choosing for ‘slow down’ or even ‘disappearing yourself’ from life stuffs won’t make you seems like you’re abandoning your life. Everyone’s timeline are different and you can’t afford things to be exactly same as what you’ve expected. Its okay when we knew other people’s timeline are way much better than us, but don’t take it as something that supposed to be rushed or being too ambitious over that until you forgot where your own life path were exactly at.
Take your time, smell the roses. You’re not in a competition.
Life will leads you to the finish line at its own right time. The timeline also won’t be exactly same like what you’ve imagined it to be. Because you never know what winds will drives you and where it’ll be. Growing old isn’t supposed to be that thing that rush you like you’re in a competition. Give yourself a chance to ask urself ‘what’s you’re hurry about?’. In the end, someday the life that you wished all this times will leads you slowly to its own place.
“Slow down you’re doing fineYou can’t be everything you want to be before your time”
Everything and everyone has its own timeline and you can’t decide your own timeline to be same like others. When others are better in their own timeline, then let them be. Someday your own body will take you wherever the place that you’re deserves to be. You can dream on over single things that you wanted, but also its good to least our expectation that not everything will come true. There some things that you’ve had planned yet it turns out didn’t happened like you wanted.
Just grab off your coffee, take a slow steps to daydream and rewind everything, remember what you have and where you are right now, and take a time to be grateful over it.
Growing old supposed to be when you enjoy every small things that you experienced and take of many appreciates for it. Take every joy of life that you have without have to rush yourself. Growing old are supposed to be when you understands that patience and timing are inseparable. Learn that growth will brings you to your own final destination when you’re just enjoy for being slow down without any fear of being left behind because you already know that your patience will deserves its own timing someday.
That every life journey will always represents passion, patience, and growth.

If you’re like me and haven’t lived in a locale with real seasons, I can attest — from my first experience in the late ’90s — that March in Vienna, Austria, is magical. I was born and raised in Southern California and before I had taken that particular overseas business trip, I had never experienced falling snow.
Sure, I’d driven up to the mountains and played in the snow, but that soft, bright, frozen tingle of perfection touching my skin? Nope, not ever — Not until my job as a managing editor for an international medical journal in 1999 flew me from LAX to Munich, and then from Munich to Vienna, to meet with gracious colleagues and helpful strangers, to schmooze and have fancy dinners, and do my job (of course).
After my first night in Vienna, enjoying a lavish dinner with editors and publishers, I walked with one of my favorite long-distance colleagues (hi, Ky!) back to our hotel. She’s from New York, and these trips were old hat for her. But for me, Vienna was the first place I’d been where scarves were considered a necessity and not an…

We all know that Billy Joel is a megastar, but some of his biggest hits came from dark places. In fact, he felt like a failed musician at times. In the early 70s, he was homeless, sleeping in laundromats, haunted by Vietnam and self-pity. After a failed suicide attempt, he checked himself into a mental hospital.
When Billy Joel wrote the song Vienna, he was 28 years old. This song is very interesting and means a lot to Joel because the lyric’s from this song is all of the advice his father gave him on his career.
“When will you realize Vienna waits for you?”
This hook explains to sit back and enjoy the ride. Your destination will be there when it's your time.
“Vienna” is a metaphor for old age, it’s not something to be afraid of, it’s something to embrace. “Vienna” is in the soft rock genre, written by himself to represent his life and of the pressure he put on himself. He understood that other people might be going through what he once did.
In this song, Vienna is about enjoying the ride before the destination. For Billy Joel, it’s about his music career and how much work he puts into it. The destination for him is all the people that listen to his songs and enjoy his work.
“Slow down, you’re doing fineYou can’t be everything you want to be before your time.”
With this line, Billy Joel is trying to spread the message that it’s ok to take a step back and take a breath, that it is ok to be wherever you’re at in life. He is telling his listeners to trust the process; the process got him where he is today. I can connect and relate to this line a lot and it helps keep me grounded. I also think most people could relate to this lyric, as humans tend to put a lot of pressure on themselves because we live in a toxic society that makes us feel like we have to be productive 24/7. This is also portrayed through the line, “Where’s the fire? What’s the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out.” Everyone, yes, even famous and successful people can experience the feeling of being burnt out.
“You’re so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need”
Vienna is known as “the city of music” located in Austria. This is because it is home too many famous musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart’s. Billy Joel is reminding himself that he belongs with those extremely successful artists and he will join them in fame one day, it just will take time like all good things.
This song and the message that Joel is trying to deliver has been so successful because of his use of various musical components and elements. Having the ability to understand and properly use musical elements can help listeners grasp the message of a song.
The tone and volume of the song, along with powerful and inspiring lyrics help illustrate the underlying message. The tone is soft and inspiring. The volume or dynamics are gentle and calm, making listener feel motivated yet relaxed at the same time. The duration, also known as how long or short a sound is held, and the tempo, which is the speed, also helps deliver the message. This is because when Joel holds onto notes softly and slowly it emphasizes the importance of the lyric. Lastly, I think the overall melody of this song helps contribute to the motivational and inspiring message Joel wanted to share.
I think it is important for famous people to be vulnerable like this. It shows the more general population that everyone struggles in life, everyone needs to slow down at times and take a step back and that anyone, no matter the circumstances can have poor mental health. It is important to take care of ourselves and we as people see their idols and famous people opening up about their struggles but also then trying to fix them, it motivates others to do so as well.
It’s crazy how when you really dig into the lyrics and the past of the song writer, it can completely change your perspective on the song and the artist. After doing research on Billy Joel and his music I have gained a whole new level of respect for him. Not just for what he has been through but for his strength to share it and his ability to make good out of a bad situation.

A few insider tips for those heading to the Austrian capital
Vienna offers some of the greatest museums in the world. The positively stately Naturhistorisches Museum and Kunsthistorisches Museum face each other across a grand courtyard, and are neighboured by the MQ (Museumsquartier) which houses the Leopold Museum and MUMOK (Museum of Modern Art). These are all worth a visit. They are truly spectacular, and utterly world-class.
But a surprise treasure among these titans is the much smaller setup of the Mozarthaus. Here, on Domgasse, the great composer’s 18th-century apartment — and the rest of the building — have been restored and turned into a museum exploring the music, politics and personal life of Mozart. The museum is relatively small, but excellently put-together and (despite quite minimalist exhibition spaces) really very insightful. Particularly interesting is the information on Amadeus’ involvement in the Freemasons, which was new to me and showed a new side to his political and social interests.
In 1949, Vienna starred in what would come to be heralded as one of the greatest noir thrillers of all time — The Third Man. Based on the Graham Greene novel, the film is set in post-war Vienna and follows American Holly Martins, who arrives in the city to meet his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), only to find that he has been killed in a car ‘accident’. Martins grows increasingly suspicious that Harry’s death was not an accident at all, leading him on a road of discovery with a shocking twist.
Vienna’s Burg Kino cinema on Opernring is among the oldest cinemas in Europe (founded in 1912) and one of the only places in the world where you can still see The Third Man on the silver screen. Catch a Friday night viewing at 11pm in the cinema’s tiny ‘Studio’ screen and you can expect to be joined by no more than 10–15 others. Then, the next day, make sure you visit the Dritte Mann Museum (Third Man Museum, open Saturdays only) not far away, which tells the story of the film’s production — and the surrounding political context — in amazing detail. There are original posters from 20 countries, photographs, annotated scripts, cameras used in the film, and even the opportunity to see a short segment of the reel on a genuine 1930s cinema projector, complete with all the cracks, scratches and whirring. This — and the screening — were the highlight of my entire trip. Magical.
The Leopold Museum is one of the city’s most famous and popular museums, showcasing the height of Austrian art including works by Klimt and Egon Schiele. But in the museum’s lower floor, at time of writing, is a special exhibition on the visual art of famous novelist and poet Victor Hugo. Best known for Les Miserables, Hugo was not noted as a visual artist, and even dismissed his work as a trivial pastime in letters to his friends.
But the work is extraordinary.
Depicting horrific landscapes of death and destruction, human and supernatural evil, the violent ink and charcoal attacks on sepia paper are genuinely chilling. Some, such as the first image seen as you enter, of gallows standing in a bleak open pasture, are rooted in Hugo’s own defiance of the death penalty that was widely used by his nation during his lifetime. While Vienna is known for its classicism, these are little-advertised works of relatively contemporary art, and deeply emotive. Not to be missed.
Kaffee mit Sachertorte: Sachertorte is a must when you visit Vienna, and the temptation is to head straight to Cafe Sacher opposite the opera house where you will find a queue stretching out the door and service that feels fed up with tourism. Instead, try Cafe Mozart, an equally elegant traditional coffee house popular with musicians from the nearby Staatsoper and also where Graham Greene wrote The Third Man (see above). Great coffee, great cake.
Italian: Germany and Austria are reputed to have the best Italian restaurants outside of Italy, and there are many fine examples in Vienna. One such is the very unassuming Frascati pizzeria and gelateria at Barnabitengasse 3. Just off the ever-busy shopping street Mariahilfer Strasse, this cosy family-run place provides basic but delicious Italian meals at absolute bedrock prices. I enjoyed an enormous fresh Pizza Napoli and a large glass of wine for under €10.
Wienerschnitzel: Overrated in my view, but if you do want to try the city’s famous delicacy of deep-fried veal, you won’t do much better than Plachuttas Gasthaus zur Oper. Located close to the Opera House, the Gasthaus does a traditional Wienerschnitzel with potato salad for around €20 which is fairly standard across the city. If you’re going to do it, do it properly at an authentic Viennese Gasthaus. Don’t be tempted by non-veal alternatives (chicken, pork) at the city’s Greek, Italian and Turkish establishments.
It’s not exactly undiscovered, but perhaps underappreciated. Vienna is packed with amazing bars and clubs, but none quite have the atmosphere of the MQ. In all seasons, the central courtyard between the Leopold Museum and the MUMOK is a hub of activity. I visited in the winter months, and spent many evenings here enjoying a mug of Glühwein with hundreds of others — locals and tourists alike. Sometimes there are even live DJs or bands playing. I caught Austrian band Naked Cameo performing, joined by a youth dance group, see video below. This open-air space has an amazing atmosphere of unity and social openness about it, and should be your first stop on any bar crawl of the city, especially around Christmas time.
Vienna’s nightlife is, to say the least, elusive. I spent my week there trying to sniff out the club scene, researching online, to little avail. Eventually I reached my final night, and decided to give Volksgarten a punt and hope for the best. Located in the park of the same name (literally Peoples’ Garden), the club doesn’t look much from the outside. Surrounded by a metal fence, it has a Mediterranean look, open courtyards dotted with palm trees and high tables. The building itself is uninspiring. But head inside, and you won’t be disappointed. I dropped in around midnight on a November Saturday, their ‘Overground’ night, and the place was already starting to fill.
€13 entry seemed steep, but included a free drink at the very impressive cocktail bar. I actually got two stuck together. Bonus. The highly professional bartenders make a range of top-notch cocktails, and there’s also every spirit, beer and champagne to boot. Tables surround a central island of palm trees. Behind there, it wasn’t long before the dancefloor got bouncing. By 1am it was wild. The atmosphere electric. A man appeared with a bunch of balloons which he handed out to people. Periodically, the roof over the dancefloor would slide open like Thunderbirds, letting the soft rain fall on the ravers below. House thumped here, while it was hip-hop in another room through the back. If you want a party, head to Volksgarten. Highly recommended.

After finishing my volunteering engagement with the BEST Foundation’s debate tournament the previous week, I stayed in Russe until Friday, working remotely and exploring this new to me area. Located by the Danube River and known as Little Vienna, the fifth largest city in Bulgaria welcomed me with freezing temperatures and icy streets and sidewalks, which made it a challenge to do as much walking as I’d have liked.
I still wandered about each day, though. Can’t keep me indoors for long!
I also finished two books this week, another fantasy and Charles Dugigg’s The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business.
Monday, February 24
Since the boat hotel I was staying at didn’t include breakfast (because it’s the off-season, I guess), I had an early start, braving the -13°C/8°F temperature in search of a place to grab nourishment and a hot beverage.
As I exited the boat, a shimmering world of delicate crystals froze me in my tracks — literally and figuratively. Every surface, tree branch, and plant was covered in white, glistening in the sun (which, by the way, provided zero warmth). Mesmerized by the winter wonder, I kept taking my…

The moment one enters the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, there is an immediate sense of stepping into another era. This magnificent institution represents far more than a conventional museum — it stands as a veritable treasury of European history, art, and cultural heritage. For travelers planning a visit to Vienna with even a modest interest in artistic expression, historical artifacts, or architecturally impressive spaces, this museum merits priority status on any itinerary. Allow me to share my personal experience at this remarkable destination.
The Kunsthistorisches Museum enjoys a prime location in central Vienna, situated on Maria-Theresien-Platz, surrounded by other notable landmarks including the Natural History Museum and the historic Hofburg Palace.
Travelers utilizing public transportation will find the museum exceptionally accessible. The U-Bahn (subway) Line U3 provides service to Volkstheater Station, requiring only a brief walk thereafter. Additionally, tram lines 1, 2, D, and 71 offer stops at the nearby Burgring station. Vienna’s public transportation system operates with remarkable efficiency, ensuring straightforward navigation to this cultural destination.
The museum’s exterior alone warrants admiration, with its impressive architectural features including towering columns and intricate frescoed details that evoke the grandeur of a royal residence. Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a spectacular main staircase adorned with marble elements, gold accents, and artistic works by the renowned artists.
The institution houses an extraordinary collection featuring works by legendary masters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, Caravaggio, Vermeer, and Raphael. Hours pass effortlessly while exploring the galleries, captivated by the remarkable detail and emotional depth captured in these paintings. Enthusiasts of Renaissance and Baroque artistic movements will find themselves thoroughly enchanted by the extensive collections.
Peter Paul Rubens’ “The Four Continents” stands as a particularly impressive work — a grand, vibrant composition that commands attention through its dynamic movement and rich color palette. Equally compelling is Vermeer’s “The Art of Painting,” a masterpiece demonstrating exceptional handling of light and remarkable realism.
After several hours of artistic appreciation, the museum’s exquisite café offers a perfect respite. Located centrally within the building, this elegant space features high ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and the gentle accompaniment of classical music. The atmosphere transports visitors to a more refined historical period.
Culinary recommendations include the traditional Apfelstrudel (apple strudel) or the iconic Sachertorte (Vienna’s celebrated chocolate cake). Either pairs excellently with a classic Melange, Vienna’s sophisticated interpretation of a cappuccino. This opportunity to pause and savor refreshments reinforces that Vienna’s appeal extends beyond visual attractions to encompass moments of contemplative enjoyment.
A particularly memorable moment occurred in one of the less frequented galleries, standing alone before Caravaggio’s “David with the Head of Goliath.” The artist’s masterful manipulation of light and shadow to create dramatic effect and dimensional depth proved utterly captivating. In that moment, there emerged a profound connection — not merely to the artwork itself, but seemingly to the artist’s creative intention across centuries. Such experiences exemplify the transformative potential of cultural travel.
For those contemplating whether this museum warrants inclusion in their Viennese itinerary, the answer is unequivocally affirmative. Whether one possesses extensive art appreciation or simply enjoys architecturally significant spaces, this institution delivers an exceptional experience. From its remarkable structural design to its world-class art collection and charming café, every aspect contributes to a truly memorable visit.
When your travels bring you to Vienna, ensure that you allocate sufficient time for exploring the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Perhaps you, too, will find yourself captivated by the brushstrokes of a masterpiece, experiencing that singular connection between viewer and artistic genius that transcends time.

I loved you. Fully. Honestly. Completely. With a heart that asked for nothing but the truth in return. And you couldn’t even give me that.
I stood by you when no one else would. I carried your hopes like they were mine, spent money  on dreams that weren’t even mine to chase. Not because you asked —  you didn’t have to. You knew I would. Because I loved you that deeply.
I gave you my time, my loyalty, my soul in quiet ways you never even noticed. Not once did you stop to ask how I was holding up while you were busy taking everything I had to offer.
You used my love like it was unlimited. Like it was something you were owed. And when I needed the bare minimum —  honesty, clarity, truth —  you gave me lies and made me feel crazy for ever seeing through them.
You made me question myself. You twisted reality until I didn’t know what to believe anymore. And still, I stayed. Still, I loved. Still, I hoped.
You knew exactly what you were doing. You knew I had a heart that would give even when it was breaking. And you used it. You drained it.
You let me carry the weight of your silence, your mood swings, your dishonesty —  while you acted like you were innocent. But you weren’t. You just didn’t care.
And maybe that’s what hurts most. Not that you left, but that you walked away without ever acknowledging what I gave. What I sacrificed. Who I became just to try and be enough for someone who was never even honest with me.
I don’t hate you. But I can’t respect you.
And if you ever read this, I hope you grow. I hope you find a way to face yourself. I hope the next person you let close gets the version of you I begged for —  the version you pretended to be.
But you’ll never hear from me again. Not in a message. Not in a call. Not in a moment of missing what we had —  because what we had was only real on my side.
Don’t reach out. Don’t look for me. You ended this. And I’ve made peace with that.
But I’ll never forget what it cost me to love someone who only ever saw me as something to use.

I recently moved to Vienna and I’ve been exploring this amazing city.
Schönbrunn Palace Garden
Today I walked over to the Schönbrunn Palace Garden. The palace was the summer residence of the Austrian emperors and at the time it was outside town. Now it is sort of on the edge of the city but squarely inside.
There are a million tourists that go there and it is not that cheap to get into see the palace itself.
BUT the main (huge) palace garden is free.
There are a couple of smaller gardens you have to pay to see but the main one has so much to offer. There are paths and fountains and buildings and benches and woods.
I had a wonderful walk around (and up, part of the garden is on a hill).
Walk where you are going
There is so much to see in Vienna and so many historical and wonderful buildings and houses. It is also a very walkable city.
Public transportation is excellent, but if you can walk to your destination. You will see so much on the way.

I’ve now been living in Vienna for almost two years (unbelievable how time flies). During that time, I’ve been to a lot of the museums, cafés, restaurants etc. that were recommended or I had read about.
Though it is an August Saturday today, I decided to brave the hordes of tourists and head into the center for a stroll and perhaps enjoy a piece of cake with coffee at my favorite café.
From my apartment, the imperial palace (Hofburg) at the edge of the center is only about a 25 to 30-minute walk.
I strolled through one of the gardens next to the palace and took a photo of the beautiful Mozart statue with music symbol flowers in front of it (see photo at top).
Then I walked through the palace complex and out the other side.
Walking down the street, I was surprised to see a sign for two museums that I had never happened upon before: the Globe Museum and the Esperanto Museum. Both are part of the National Library organization (the State Hall at the National Library nearby is also worth a look).
I was even more surprised when I went in to find that both together only cost 5 euro (about $5.50). Most museums in Vienna cost at least double or quadruple that. I will admit that these two weren’t that big, but even smaller museums here are often more than that.

I look at life as a Richard Linklater film. It is mostly made of ordinary days. But on some days, unique connections and conversations make life exciting — that’s when you think life as an extraordinary gift.
Photo: The city of Vienna in Austria where Before Sunrise takes place.
Linklater has been trying to give life a meaning since the 1980s. Many consider Boyhood (2014), a film about growing up as his best work. No doubt it is a brilliant film, but for me, his best work is the ‘Before’ trilogy (1995–2013) collectively. The love story of an American man Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke and a French woman Celine, played by Julie Delpy spans decades and is so realistic and profound — that it seems magical. I know, what a paradoxical statement to make. What Jesse and Celine have is what we today call #CoupleGoals on social media. The story stands to the test of time. I can’t help but put the trilogy on top of the vast filmography Linklater has.
The three films Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013) are set in Vienna, Paris and Peloponnese respectively. Outside the trilogy, Jesse and Celine also briefly appear in Linklater’s animated feature Waking Life (2001).
Last summer, I travelled to Vienna and visited the record store in which Jesse and Celine get into the music booth and have a moment listening to the song Come Here by Kath Bloom. The 1:20 minutes scene contains melodious singing by Bloom with the following lyrics —
“There’s wind that blows in from the northAnd it says that loving takes this course
Come here, come here
No I’m not impossible to touchI have never wanted you so much
Come here, come here
Have I never laid down by your sideBaby, let’s forget about this pride
Come here, come here”
It is my favourite scene in the film. Yes, the scene with silence between the characters in the movie otherwise just made of naturalistic dialogues between the two characters. Linklater, with the help of Hawke and Delpy’s expressions, captures the awkwardness and wish for something to happen between the two young people about to fall in love so beautifully. The truthful nature of such moments is why the trilogy has such a dedicated fan base.
I was travelling across central Europe during the summer break, and I took a long bus ride from Berlin to Vienna. After checking out the main tourist attractions in the city, I decided to take the path of Jesse and Celine. I walked through Votive Church, Maria Theresa Monument and Albertina Terrace and in between, I stopped at Alt & Neu, the record store where the music booth scene was filmed.
The original German name for the store is Teuchtler Schallplattenhandlung u Antiquariat which means Teuchtler record store and antiquarian bookshop. Located at Windmühlgasse 10, the store has an extensive collection of vinyl records and music CDs. You will find all kinds of music in this store, from classical and jazz to rock and international pop. When I spoke to the store manager, he claimed it to be Vienna’s oldest second-hand vinyl store. I believed him.
Many of the store visitors are picture pilgrims like me who happen to visit the store not to see the vinyl collection but to see the place where Jesse and Celine connected. The store owners, of course, know this very well. They have decorated the insides of the store with many posters of Before Sunrise.
I spent about an hour at the store, going through records, listening to some tracks and talking to the manager. My favourite track listening was When I Fall In Love by Isaac Hayes.
I got the appeal of the place. It is a fabulous place to explore with a date (or even alone). I truly enjoyed my visit. For a film buff like me, it was worth all the efforts.
Previously, I had also visited several locations in Paris from the film’s sequel Before Sunset, for instance, Shakespeare & Company bookshop and Le Pure Cafe. Next, I want to visit Peloponnese where Before Midnight, the final film of the trilogy takes place. I am not in a hurry, though. Maybe I’ll wait till I meet my own Celine before I travel to Greece.
These films have helped me understand the importance of patience but also to believe in the magic of spontaneity. Applicable to both personal and professional lives. Thanks to the cinematic art of this kind, I often question my theories, behaviour and guiding principles of life. The humanism seen in Linklater’s films has also taught me about my right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to my own life.
There is a good chance you probably do not understand what I am trying to say in the last paragraph, but that’s ok. I encourage you to watch the films if you haven’t already, or read the screenplay if you prefer reading. In the end, to quote Celine from the film, “If there’s any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it’s almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.”
So please try watching these films and maybe we can have deep and meaningful conversations about the philosophy behind these films. I am sure our discussions will turn out magical, just like the trilogy.
Note: At the time of publication of this article, Medium does not pay me because its Partner Program is not available in India. Stripe, the financial service by which Medium pays to writers is still in the beta “preview” mode in the country. Hopefully, they will fix this soon, till then, if you enjoyed reading my article, please consider buying me a coffee here.

Last December, I found myself wandering the charming streets of Vienna, drawn by the promise of a unique artistic experience at the Egon Schiele Museum. It was a journey that went far beyond the typical sightseeing tour — a deep dive into a world where art and emotion intertwined to create an atmosphere unlike any other. Imagine strolling through a city adorned with festive lights, crisp winter air gently caressing your face, and a palpable sense of anticipation as you approach one of the most intriguing art museums in Europe. I want to share this experience with you as if we were old friends chatting over a warm cup of coffee about our latest adventures.
Stepping inside the Egon Schiele Museum is like entering a vibrant dialogue between the past and the present. The museum is dedicated entirely to the life and works of Egon Schiele, an artist whose expressive lines and bold color palettes continue to inspire awe and introspection. Every corner of the museum seems to pulse with the raw emotion that defined Schiele’s work. The curated collection is not just an exhibit of paintings and sketches — it’s a narrative that tells the story of a man who dared to see the world differently, capturing both its beauty and its inherent chaos.
Walking through the galleries, I was immediately struck by the intensity of Schiele’s pieces. Each work carries a story; some evoke a sense of melancholy, while others burst forth with raw, unfiltered passion. The interplay of light and shadow in his art invites you to pause, reflect, and feel every emotion as though you were part of the scene. It was a moment of pure connection — a silent conversation between the artist and me, unfolding through every stroke of his brush.
The museum’s layout is thoughtfully designed to lead you on an immersive journey. As you move from one gallery to the next, the transition is seamless, almost as if you’re traveling through different chapters of Schiele’s creative life. The ambient lighting, the careful arrangement of the artworks, and even the subtle background music create an atmosphere that is both intimate and grand. It’s easy to lose yourself in the experience, letting the art speak directly to your soul.
One of the most striking aspects of the museum is how it manages to maintain a sense of intimacy despite housing such a vast collection. Standing before a large, bold canvas, I felt as though I was sharing a private moment with the artist — a moment of vulnerability, passion, and truth. Schiele’s work isn’t merely observed; it’s experienced. Each painting is a window into his inner world, and every line and color choice resonates with a depth that is hard to put into words.
What makes Egon Schiele’s work so compelling is his fearless exploration of the human condition. His portraits and self-portraits capture not only physical likenesses but also the intangible emotions that lie beneath the surface. In one gallery, I spent what felt like hours admiring a series of drawings that portrayed raw expressions of vulnerability and defiance. There was a palpable sense of tension in every piece, a tension that mirrors the complexity of life itself.
The museum does an incredible job of contextualizing Schiele’s work within the broader landscape of early 20th-century art. Through well-curated displays and informative panels, you learn about the historical, social, and personal influences that shaped his artistic vision. This educational aspect added a new layer of appreciation for his work, transforming a mere viewing into an enlightening experience that deepened my understanding of art history.
For me, one of the most memorable parts of the visit was finding a quiet nook in the museum — a small, sunlit corner where I could sit and simply reflect on the impact of what I had seen. In that peaceful moment, surrounded by centuries of artistic heritage, I realized that the museum was more than just a repository of art. It was a sanctuary for the mind and soul, a place where emotions were not only observed but celebrated. Here, in the midst of Schiele’s masterpieces, I rediscovered the beauty of vulnerability and the strength found in embracing one’s true self.
The experience was deeply personal. I found myself comparing the bold, defiant lines of Schiele’s portraits to my own life’s challenges and triumphs. It was as if the art reached out and held up a mirror, inviting me to see not just the world as it is, but as it could be — a tapestry woven with both light and darkness, hope and despair. This intimate connection with the art is what makes the Egon Schiele Museum a must-visit destination for anyone who values authentic, transformative experiences.
While the magic of the museum lies in its art, a visit here is also an opportunity to experience the cultural pulse of Vienna. The museum’s location offers a chance to explore the vibrant local scene without straying too far from the heart of the artistic community. Public transportation in Vienna is excellent, making it easy to weave your museum visit into a broader exploration of the city’s rich history and contemporary flair. Even if art is not usually your primary interest, the immersive nature of this museum is likely to leave a lasting impression, inspiring you to delve deeper into the world of expressionist art.
Moreover, the museum staff’s warm hospitality enhances the overall experience. Their genuine passion for Schiele’s work and the history behind it is contagious, and their insights add a human touch to the visit. It’s not just about admiring art — it’s about engaging with it, understanding it, and, most importantly, feeling it in every sense.
Leaving the Egon Schiele Museum, I carried with me a profound sense of gratitude and inspiration. The experience was a reminder that art has the extraordinary power to bridge time and space, connecting us to the deepest parts of our humanity. It’s a journey that invites you to explore not just the works of a visionary artist, but also the intricacies of your own inner world.
If you’re planning your next adventure, I wholeheartedly recommend adding the Egon Schiele Museum to your itinerary. It’s a destination where every detail is a testament to the beauty of human creativity and where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary. Allow yourself the luxury of losing track of time as you wander through galleries filled with passion, history, and an undeniable sense of wonder.
This visit wasn’t just another stop on my travel log — it was a transformative experience that reaffirmed my belief in the power of art to touch hearts and change perspectives. I hope that by sharing my journey, you feel encouraged to seek out your own moments of artistic revelation. After all, every great adventure starts with a single step, and sometimes, that step leads you into a world where art and life merge in the most beautiful of ways.
Thank you for reading about my journey. May your travels be filled with discovery, reflection, and the kind of moments that stay with you long after the trip is over. Until next time, keep exploring and let art guide you on your own unique path.

I stared out into the void, or as much of the void as provided by the view of the upright and locked tray table in front of me, squished in the center row of seats on a trans-Atlantic flight after dinner and once the cabin lights had been dimmed for a precious few hours of sleep. I had left my wife home, alone, working on writing her dissertation in a city 3,000 miles away from where she was still a student, her patience and focus of typing and typing and typing from a corner in our apartment wearing thin, and my absence for these two weeks further straining our rather complicated living arrangements for the past year. We had lived apart on opposite coasts for four months, her finishing her Ph.D. and me starting a new job, though my flexible position afforded a visit every few weeks, and then she moved with me in the new year, but was far from her lab, her colleagues, and her advisor, so deadlines seemed to keep drifting for actually finishing and moving on. Nevertheless, she was excited for me to go to this conference, but deadlines for accepting invitations and planning had been months in the past, and as the departure date neared and the prospect of two weeks away became more real, some doubts began to arise if now was indeed the best time. Moments before we kissed goodbye on our apartment’s threshold, I had slipped the thin book into my backpack, something I had always been interested to read and was short enough I could finish it on the flight, but now, the closed book on my lap alone under my seat’s spotlight amongst a raft of snoring travelers, questioned the intelligence of bringing Camus’s L’Étranger.
One year into my post-doc, my personal research portfolio was beginning to slowly grow. Casting off projects assigned to me by my Ph.D. advisor had been relatively easy and something I had already done three years ago, in favor of a project I had started with a fellow student that had since taken on a life of its own. This co-student project tapped into a burgeoning subfield of particle physics whose inaugural yearly conference had actually taken place in an adjacent building to where my graduate school office was, and now only a few years along regularly had over 100 attendees and strong representation from all of the large experiments at the LHC. My first presentation on this project at this conference had been unique and impressed the community enough that the following winter, I had been offered multiple post-docs in the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, alone, accepting MIT as my intellectual home for the next three years. Essentially on my arrival to campus, I vowed to put aside those graduate school projects, to start something brand new, something original that would be indelibly identified as my own intellectual creation. This was, by contrast, not easy and progress on anything was slow, indirect, and sometimes frustratingly failure-prone, seeing the tiniest of light rays peeking through a hole only to calculate and calculate and calculate and realize that what you had been doing that whole time was not logically consistent.
The intellectual support and environment of the group at MIT at that time was definitely the most magical experience I have ever had and was perhaps the most special place to be in the entire world at the time for what I was doing. My post-doc advisor was merely two years into tenure track and publishing at a breakneck rate, his office across the narrow hallway from mine and stopped by each morning he arrived to chat about the new papers that appeared on the arXiv preprint server last night, or to see how a calculation was going, or to show me a mysterious and confusing plot that would then occupy my daydreams for the next several hours. His door was always open, and I returned the favor, dropping in unannounced numerous times throughout the day, to sit in his square high-walled pleather chair across from his desk, and at least puzzle over something together verbally, or one of us would walk over to his floor-to-ceiling blackboard to write an equation that we could then stare at in pensive silence. Each week, there were at least three topical seminars on particle physics to attend, in addition to the physics department colloquium, so everyone who was working on the great problems in the field were continually passing through, dispelling their wisdom in their formal talk, and then the truth would actually come out during the hosted dinner. There would have been no way that I could have learned what projects were interesting, useful, and impactful by merely sitting in my room all day, door closed, head down, hunched over my desk.
Two major ideas had been born in this environment and had correspondingly resulted in papers by the following spring. While both broadly addressed physics relevant for making predictions in particle collider experiment, they were otherwise relatively unrelated, which troubled me. At one level, they were obviously deeply connected, and I could imagine the first glimpses of nearly bottomless research potential if I could marry them successfully. Some conversations with others in the group at MIT had helped broaden my perspective, but something was still lacking. Another professor in the group had recently won funding through the Simons Foundation, the philanthropic arm of billionaire mathematician Jim Simons who left academia to found Renaissance Technologies, and helped organize a relaxed, discussion-focused workshop in Vienna, Austria, with a long-term collaborator and faculty at UWien. One was required to spend at least two weeks there, but, as members of the MIT group, Simons would be graciously covering our expenses, so saying yes was all too easy. This would be the place to have those conversations with global experts, to stare at equations on a board, to find and recruit new collaborators, or even to just convince the community that this was a question worth thinking about.
The Rathausplatz was converted into a summers-long festival setting, thousands of seats arranged in rows facing the city hall’s façade, itself covered with an enormous white curtain for the nightly film screenings, and then lining the promenade and spilling into the bounding park were dozens of food stands, serving a sampling of every cuisine imaginable, at least through Viennese interpretation. To ward off jet-lag for the night, I had walked the mile or so from my stifling greenhouse of a hotel room to observe the party, making a slight detour from the geodesic path to find the front door of the Institute and where my office for the next two weeks would be. The door was nondescript, but across the narrow gasse faced the US Embassy in Austria which, at the time anyway, had garnered minor celebrity status as the place that Edward Snowden would have been taken if he had actually been on the Bolivian president’s plane. Capturing a selfie with my laptop monitor’s camera, I then continued on, drawn along by the growing noise of the crowd and wafting smells of classics like pretzels, schnitzel, sausages, and kraut, truck-stop diner recreations of greasy burgers, fries, and a Coke, yeasty, malty lagers sloshed sloppily into masskrugs, and even ice cream carts offering the Vermonter staple of Ben & Jerry’s. For my first meal off the plane, I chose boldly, asking for ein burrito, bitte, with all the fillings, and over the counter it was passed, tucked snugly in foil and cradled it while moving over to a vacant standing table. It was stuffed to bursting with ground beef, black beans, corn kernels, something passing as sour cream, maybe some iceberg lettuce, and probably white rice and was perfectly, ideally, flawlessly flavorless.
Erwin Schrödinger, by some reckoning the inventor of quantum mechanics or at least of the equation that carries his name, posthumously leant his name to the Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics as the most famous scientist from Vienna. The ESI was founded about 20 years earlier as a place of contemplative retreat and intellectual stimulation, hosting workshops and conferences, programs and summer schools on anything related to mathematics or physics with a sufficiently defensible amount of mathematics in it. This month, the topic was of Jets and Quantum Fields for LHC and Future Colliders, a grand and sweeping enough name to justify its place there, but specific enough for essentially the entire world community of a couple hundred people whose research interests fit snugly under the title’s umbrella to be invited for a stay. From the front door labeled solely by a faded sign lacking capitalization, stairs rose steeply to the main hallway, where each step with any gait and with any shoe on the stone tile floor echoed off of the blackboards lining the wall and the marble bust of the namesake, and to the right was the door to the main seminar room, straight ahead to the toilets, and left, where I turned, to the workspaces. In the theme of promoting conversation and collaboration, any personal offices were basically non-existent, instead, broad, open rooms each with three or four desks, a bookshelf, and another wall of blackboards, and here, tucked in a corner with a view out the narrow window, I set down my backpack and settled in.
Coffee was slowly beginning to grow on me, and being in Europe, free coffee, and the socialization that a huddle around the carafe provides encouraged me to join in the conversations and introductions already in progress over sips and around blowing away the wisps of steam. However, as coffee is also wont to escape rather quickly, I excused myself for the bathrooms, around the corner, then through a swing door that didn’t quite shut completely, to the landing that lay in front of the couple of steps up to the row of stalls. With now a few trips to Europe behind me, the privacy afforded one in public toilets as compared to the half-door with both excess leg room and inch-wide gaps in the stall corners familiar in the US, was no longer surprising but had yet to cease to amaze. The toilets at the ESI were no exception, with hermetic, floor-to-ceiling doors and rubber weatherstripping in the jamb for a double layer of protection for each personal stall, and then inside, an immaculately clean head, several rolls of multi-ply toilet paper, and even a brush off to the side for clean up afterward. This all was more or less consistent with the standard I had now come to expect, but what elevated the experience to the heavens was that on the wall to my right was a blackboard with a few pieces of chalk on the ledge, so that there was no inconvenient time for inspiration. By the afternoon, once everyone had passed through at least once, the toilet boards were the talk of the coffee break.
The informal and unstructured nature of the workshop encouraged unfocused drifting from one’s desk, to spontaneous, interjected questions thrown out to the two or three office mates, to eavesdropping on the calculations or scratching of chalk on board that had floated over the low dividing wall. Sometimes the distraction would be intolerable enough that action was required, to set down your pen and walk over to stare directly at the mathematical expression that had already confused two others. My own discussions had encouraged a visitor, just a couple years my senior and someone I had worked with when I was an older undergraduate and he a younger graduate student, and I started again, to explain the baby steps of a calculation I was setting up to just begin to understand a toy example of a problem that had been sharpening in the past couple of years. He had also thought about some proto-cases and further had developed much of the necessary techniques to actually complete the calculation, so in my stilted explanation and terse, slanted board work, I eventually regurgitated all of my thoughts on the problem, and hints and suggestions for next steps were added by my my neighbor, who, at the same time, identified the leaps in logic that would need to be overcome. With nothing more to contribute now, he excused himself, and I sat back down in my chair, copying the boardwork into my notebook and returned to staring out the window, my mind racing in confusion.
Rather quickly, the groups and subgroups of us that had naturally divided up had relaxed to standard, comfortable dinner choices, initiated by whoever was first and most hungry and then, like a snowball, more and more of us capped our pens, closed our laptops, and zipped up our backpacks and set out. Each night, we would be flung to some other corner of Vienna, to either a biergarten out back of a pub, long wooden tables densely packed in a courtyard between brick buildings, open to the sky save the broad leaves of an ancient chestnut, or for schnitzel, though budgetary constraints restricted us to the schwine version and not the local delicacy Wiener variant with fried veal. Our beers drained as the sun set, and we would be on the move again, some ending the night and walking to their hotel rooms, and others such as myself, back to the Institute for a few more hours of work before a Skype call to the States and bed. Dark afforded a contemplative silence that was absent during the day, a chance to focus and distill and process the conversations into an equation or two to write on the board, left for tomorrow’s work. My walk home mostly followed the tram line north, away from the center of the city, tracks along the center of a wide boulevard, and just beyond a stop adjacent to towering pines to one side and flats on the other, I saw a badger waddle by across the deserted road, disappearing into the sodium-yellowed shrubs underneath the ground floor apartment windows.
Sprinkled throughout the unscheduled discussions and spontaneous meetings was a touch of regularity, with a few participants selected each week to present a talk during the morning’s coffee break. I was one of the lucky ones this week, and chose to discuss a recent paper I had published with my post-doc advisor on a strange and surprising feature we had identified in the process of performing calculations for predictions of physics that would be observed at the LHC. Ample time was allotted with the suggestion that a small fraction would be for presentation and a larger fraction for the inevitable arguments that would and should arise in any good and sufficiently controversial talk. So, standing in front of the rows of green sliding chalkboards, I kept my goals limited, pledging some motivation verbally for why the calculation was interesting and that, naively at least, should make no sense whatsoever. Perhaps the thing that was hardest for the audience to grasp was its simplicity, as all I did next was calculate the area of a couple of triangles, relate that to the probability of observing a particle, and then with a swish of my hand to push a board up, revealed the turn on the final board. I had hidden nothing, every step had been completely transparent and obviously next in the logical series, but the prestige was that from the answer, there was no going backward, there was no way to return to the start again as the process had washed away the footprints in the sand. Complaints and whataboutisms rained from a pair of people seated in the back row, this was just some special case, what if more realistic effects were included, and I initially tried to respond but was soon drowned out by rebuttals from the other side of the room and piling on from the front, and silently gained a renewed determination to understand this better.
Lunches went typically like this: as a junior colleague of the organizer from MIT, I was among those regularly selected for a meal off campus, at some favorite place of the organizer from UWien. Our cohort, relatively small and some days even small enough to fit comfortably at a four-top, would head out following our local guide and arrive at the restaurant that was, midday and midweek, almost always otherwise deserted. If today’s group was on the larger size, a crowd-pleasing menu and long booths were called for, but a small group could sit outside at a bit fancier place and a favorite returned to a few times during my stay was informally referred to as the French academy, not because of the style of cuisine, but because of its proximity to an immersion school. We would enter through a door that opened to a garden or park, tables set under the cooling shade of beeches, and request free Leitungswasser while the younger of the group chose a beer and the elder a Clausthaler, lest a full stomach and the heat of a summer’s afternoon lull them to sleep. Physics specifically was rarely the topic of conversation, a mere hour’s break during the whole day, but instead recommendations for Viennese entertainment, places to travel on the weekend, or the state of regional politics were discussed. At the request Zahlen, bitte the organizer from MIT would always wave off my attempts at pulling out my wallet, as Simons would be covering lunch.
Another evening saw me back in the Institute after dinner, the sun having long since set, back again writing at the blackboard, pacing to and fro, or just staring at it seated at the edge of my desk, hypnotized, thoughts unfocused and hazy, tumbling around in my brain but going nowhere. A cursory glance at my watch revealed that a respectable time for departure was long in the past, so I gathered my things and hurried down the stairs and out the door, walking at a brisk pace on the radiating pavement through the finally-cooled night air. This night was no busier than previous, I was still all alone on the tram track street’s sidewalk, though behind I could hear a car speeding up and then passing me, its illuminated scarlet tail lights and rooflight fading as it turned a corner ahead. Though it had seemed to be in a great hurry, once I had turned that corner, there the car was, parked, hazard lights blinking, and the driver’s door open and just off the sidewalk, at those same bushes into which that badger had waddled, I could make out the silhouette of a person, standing slightly hunched facing away from their car, legs astride of some invisible saddle, with the unmistakable sound of drizzling water. My hotel would be on the other side anyway, so I thought this as good a place as any to cross the street.
As with several times since I left, this Skype call had turned silent, staring, longing for each other, lonely and confined in 800 square feet with just blank pages of her thesis glowing from her screen. I could tell her about the food I’ve eaten, or the research projects that I had made progress on, or the baroque architecture of palaces and cathedrals and museums, or that opera is piped into the public bathrooms of the Wiener Staatsoper, but it made the chasm deeper, the rift wider. I was here surrounded by everyone in my field, days filled with busy lunches and talks and gossip with coffee and felt more alone, more that I was faking, putting on a face and acting to be excited by what I was doing around a hollow inside missing that part that inspired and motivated. Now long after midnight here and dinnertime there, I had to saw goodbye and a weak, resigned goodbye was echoed, miss yous exchanged, and with a kiss closed my laptop. The still air had done little to cool the room through the cracked window, so all I could do was lie in the dark on the springy double bed, a few inches too short for me so my feet hung over the edge, and stare at the ceiling until exhaustion succumbed to sleep.
I had scoped out a nice five mile loop for a morning run through a combination of MapMyRun and Google Maps that would take me north, away from the city center to quieter neighborhoods that hugged the base of the grapevined hills, and had woke early with plenty of time to enjoy the crisp morning before the sun had aroused the ground from its slumber and into its humid, hazy hypnopompic state. A few turns into the run, I had reached a waypoint, running adjacent to a stream, and jumped into and off of the road as the width of the cobbled sidewalk waxed and waned. Next, I should turn right at a major intersection, but the name of that street had dissolved from my memory, so I had to trust that my subconscious had internalized the route and would just tell my feet the way. My legs formed no such divining rod, however, and I was left to guessing, and this right seemed as good as I could expect, so away I went. I had not noticed that my path north had drifted significantly west to become nearly parallel itself with the base of the hills, so a right turn started gaining elevation and the road I was on shrunk and shrunk, rather unlike the behavior of major thoroughfares, and soon I was on a one-lane path, the shoulder overgrown with brambles, and that transformed abruptly into a flight of concrete stairs once the pitch had become too steep. Now certain I had missed my turn, I nevertheless beat on, with a certainty that a right turn would appear and transport me back to the familiar.
Enough right turns had eventually bore me back east, but not before gaining more and more and more elevation, the trees and brush had thinned down to tightly trimmed grass, and I had reached the pot-holed farm road that orbited the summit. Just higher now was the farmhouse, but I turned away, and there below lay all of Vienna, filling my view but silent, the sounds of the city waking up had not yet permeated to these heights. An emerald carpet of stringed vines rolled down and away, and stretched to the base of the hill into which the blanket of trees was tucked, quilted with the alleys and streets and avenues and boulevards. The majestic Danube, broad and blue, cut the western bank and drew the eye along a line southeast into the heart of Vienna, to just where the domes of palaces and spires of cathedrals peeked above the apartment rooftops. Farther yet, the haze had already started its morning meal, making its slow march north, devouring buildings and roads and leaving behind a formless, milky nothingness. This sight soon required a more and more extreme twisting back while running forward, but then mercifully the path cut steeply down and into the darkened forest, growing broader as tributaries rejoined until its delta spilled into that street I had missed, now almost an hour ago.
I never had graduate students of my own, as a post-doc one is not presented with such a responsible distraction, and then later, teaching at a liberal arts college, there were simply no graduate students to be had, though still plenty of overeager undergraduates desiring to do research. By now, the problem had sharpened, the goals defined, and I knew what needed to be done, but I couldn’t do it alone. One collaborator was natural, a fellow post-doc at MIT with an expertise in precision calculations that could ensure that the edifice was sound, through whom I could learn and whose hammer would complement my strength of identification of the right and most interesting nail to strike first. We had shared some notes back and forth on the initial framing of the problem and some preliminary calculations and in doing so, isolated the remaining issue: we needed one more person in this collaboration to do all of the calculations. The organizer from MIT had a couple of graduate students just starting their third years, the time when, finally, graduate students become useful, and give to a project more than the effort of teaching and hand-holding takes from an advisor. I asked about one student who I knew and had chatted with a bit this week, but he was already engaged in a huge, open-ended, multi-year effort to extend results first published in 2010, and with no clear deadline on the horizon, whose time was completely filled. However, the organizer’s other student had no such prior engagements and further was new to the whole theoretical physics business, having made the extremely rare and nearly practically impossible jump from admission as an experimentalist but qualified to Ph.D. candidacy as a theorist, so was in need of a project on which to cut their teeth. So, after lunch one day, I had my first conversation with the student who came the closest to being my only graduate advisee.
Theoretical physicists publish papers throughout graduate school and because we don’t use that time to construct an experiment and analyze data, a theoretical physics Ph.D. thesis is usually little more than a collection of these papers, and all that needs to be written at the eleventh hour of the graduation deadline is a short but sweeping introduction to tie them together. To do this requires really no more than a couple of papers, and a successful student that correspondingly fields a couple of post-doc offers may have half a dozen or so, and I myself had seven published papers in graduate school of which I chose three to highlight for my moderate 116-page thesis. Then there are off-scale students, with well more than 10 highly-regarded papers published in graduate school and theses that require the better half of a ream to print, and this effort and accomplishment never goes unnoticed. By 3 years in the future, this student, my student, had published eight papers with me of his 14 total, stapled the three most influential into a 500 page thesis, which was subsequently awarded the prize for the most outstanding original research in theoretical particle physics in the country. During the winter of his final year, on the awkward 9 month lead time prior-to-job academic schedule, he was sorting through an embarrassment of post-doc offers from each of the top eight places to do particle physics (exclusive of his graduate institution), and then a few years later, joined the faculty at an Ivy League. Globally, my part in all of this was tiny, my letters of recommendation were strong, yes, but they could say no more than what was already there in his papers, but I hold tight to whatever little influence I had as my most proud academic achievement. And it all started with a mere nudge, a suggestion, to meet with this student.
From the front door, stairs led down, into the cellar of the 12 Apostles, tables spread throughout the centuries-old vaulted cavern hewn into the rock, then bricked over, the various parts of barrels augmenting the medieval aesthetic. The ambiance was by far the most intriguing aspect of tonight’s dinner, with the beer and the goulash merely passable, but our group of graduate students and post-docs maintained lively conversation, reflecting on the week or two since arriving. Someone at the table suggested dessert, and even only ok apfelstrudel à la mode is still apfelstrudel à la mode, so soon a symphony of spoons were clicking on the ceramic plates, but in parallel, others were pulling out Euros and doing some quick estimates of their required share. As we were about to hail a waiter, the coda from another table ended and fiddler and accordionist stalked their next prey, but we were as helpless as sitting ducks, midweek and late, late at night already so few other tables were occupied, they pounced and for some reason picked me off, planted to my left and right. I was stuck, I couldn’t push my chair back because the fiddler’s bow hand trapped me in, and the threatening, smug wise-guy face of the accordionist scared me into a smile, thin and emotionless, but stretched beyond the edges of my nose enough that I could fake enjoying it. The worst part was yet to come, as once the music stopped, they lingered, and the longer they lingered the greater the guilt, and a few at our table passed a Euro or two their way, but I was able to drop my glance, avoiding eye contact, and didn’t look again until ascending the stairs, the musicians’ backs to us, ambushing another table.
Of our dining diaspora, I alone walked northwest toward my hotel, past the darkened door of the Institute, and then connected back with that tram-line street, long since deserted but made somewhat hospitable every block or so where the warm amber glow poured down from the excited sodium vapor above. Where the road ascended slightly here now was that corner, nudged right by the ancient, stoic tree, and, unlike previous nights, all was too quiet so my consciousness was lost somewhere in my thoughts and memories and dreams. I didn’t see the car with its headlights off idling ahead, creeping in its lane as I continued to step unconsciously forward, I didn’t hear the passenger’s window roll down, nor did I notice the muzzle that just peeked out of it, but the stream that hit my chest, the howling, cackling laughter erupting in the night, and the revving engine and squealing tires jolted me into the present, and all I could manage to coax out of my throat was “Hey!”, though any audience was already a block behind me and moving away fast. My shirt was drenched, I had been sprayed by a water gun from about 5 yards, a perfect bullseye hit from that would-be sniper, and, though late, the heat had never really receded even after the sun had set, but I was now refreshed and cooler, and a smile grew across my face along with a couple of head shakes and chuckles. I suffered no bodily harm and could change my shirt back in my hotel, but at least it wasn’t cat pee.
The train lurched forward, the snaps running down its length like the crest of a wave as coach couplings tightened, and we accelerated first in shadow and then in the morning’s glinting sunlight once out of the station. My day had started hours earlier, rising with the sun to eat a quick breakfast of accumulated snacks, then to stuff my camera, more of the snacks and a water bottle in my pack, and then to walk the four miles or so from far north to far south across the city, through familiar streets to the Institute and then onto the Rathaus, and then veering right off the Ring, through a posh neighborhood adjacent to the Belvedere and thick with embassies and consulates representing countries throughout the world. I had had the spontaneous idea that, given my current proximity and that I was unlikely to travel to eastern Europe very often, I should take this opportunity and a train to the capital city of some neighboring country, and had rather randomly selected Hungary and Budapest as my destination. I dozed off and on, as much as the upright molded plastic second-class seat and an elbow on the window sill would allow, but was awakened around the stop at Györ by a ticket check. A few seats in front of me was a complicated discussion in Hungarian between conductors and a newly boarded passenger, with passports out and open, more conductors arriving from the front or rear, exchanging words, and then rushing on to consult someone or something in a far away cabin. The terminus of this train was Budapest and we had already started on again and though I knew no Hungarian, it seemed like the passenger with a conductor or two hovering over for the duration of the ride had not paid, but there was nothing to be done until we decelerated and the couplings slacked and again rang out.
Over the next six hours, I walked down the boulevards of Pest, past the birthplace of Theodor Herzl just a few blocks from the train station, across the Chain Bridge and up the hills of Buda, taking in the view and panoramic pictures of the Danube, the spires of the parliament building and the technicolor tiled rooftops that lie below, circling the top of the hill, from the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene, its façade riddled with bullet holes seated in the bombed stone plaza to the courtyard of Buda Castle up to the Fountain to King Matthias and the open-air excavation of an ancient, ruined church. Down I went, crossing the Chain Bridge back to Pest, and turned upriver toward the parliament building, but paused at the abandoned, empty iron Shoes on the Danube Bank and then with my back to the river, headed inland, arriving at St. Stephen’s Basilica as a newly married couple first exited the open doors in a rising, drifting halo of iridescent soap bubbles and then descended the steps, surrounded by clapping and cheering friends and family, and where I snuck to the side entrance to climb to the balcony for a view back to Buda. This entire time, I was never tempted to enter a restaurant for lunch and only stopped in one shop on the ramrod-straight Andrássy Avenue, a ceramics store where I found a cute mug on which a frazzled cat was painted, and once enough tissue paper surrounded and cradled it, gently tucked it in my pack, and marched on, a mile further due northeast and entered the City Park at Heroes Square, greeted by the bronzed Seven Chieftains of the Magyars.
Time until my train was now running short, so I turned from Városliget to walk the few blocks back to the train station. I kept my feet moving while I slung my camera and backpack from my shoulder in one move, unzipping the pack to tuck the camera in, but in doing so obscured the view of anything directly in front of me on the sidewalk, and just as the camera slid in, bang went my knee and up went a scream from below. I had inadvertently kneed a child, by their size, no more than four years old, thankfully not hard enough to get hurt or fall, but sudden enough to get startled. Louder came the screams and tears erupted from the child’s eyes, and I asked in vain in English about “Mom” or “home”, but the response was only more pathetic sniffles. The sidewalk was far from deserted but no one stopped, and it even seemed that they avoided me and this child, sped up their gait, or turned their gaze away, as if we and the air around us carried some sort of infectious curse. Still no one came to the aid of this child, no one acknowledged the child’s whimpers, and as moments stretched to minutes, a panicked sweat dripped from my temples as anything I was doing was in vain, neither calming nor raising the faintest sympathy from strangers, so I left him there and continued to the train station, and at the next crosswalk looked back, but no sound was to be heard, nothing for the crowds to evade, the child had vanished.

Billy Joel’s Timeless Melody Still Inspires More Than Four Decades After Its Release
On July 25th, Billy Joel played his last show at Madison Square Garden, ending a ten year residency. At 75 years old, with a career that spans 5 decades, he has played that arena more than 150 times. It was the end of an era.
While his debut album was released in 1971, it would be “The Stranger” album that would earn him critical and commercial success. “The Stranger” was released on September 29th 1977. It was the soundtrack of my childhood. It remains to this day, one of my favorite albums. While the album is nearly perfect, with not a single ‘skippable’ song, “Vienna” will always be my favorite song on the track list.
Released as the B-side to “Just the Way You Are”, it indicates that Billy Joel never imagined the long lasting popularity of the song. Currently, it ranks only behind “Piano Man” as his most streamed song. “Vienna” never became a radio staple, the way some of his biggest hits have been, yet it never left the public consciousness either. Featured in films like Thirteen Going On 30, and featured in countless Tik Toks, it seems to speak to the romantic ideal of leaving childhood behind and becoming an adult.
The song was a staple of my youth. My parents loved “The Stranger Album”. Hardly a Saturday morning would pass…

No one really prepares you for what happens after a relationship ends.
It's not just about letting go of a person, it's about losing the version of yourself that revolved around them.
Suddenly, you're waking up in a life you don't recognize.
You have to relearn your mornings, reimagine your weekends, and find comfort in places that aren't tied to them.
You start rebuilding your identity from the ground up — your voice, your rhythm, your dreams.
This isn't just about moving on.
It's about becoming.
Piece by piece, you rise into the woman you were always meant to be.

A series of conversations with outstanding Austrian filmmakers and artists.

In your performances you work with a specific type of mythology – the Austrian folklore. My first contact with this phenomenon was in Hallein, where they organise the annual Krampus-run. Comparing what you do with it on a performance level and the original, ritualistic processions of these particular myths, I was struck by how well the old processions transcends into the modern performance art. Do you know what I mean? Have you noticed it too?
Well, not really. I never planned it to see it like a open-source-format. In the beginning I was more interested to know more about these practices, customs and these festive events and all the stories behind. Because as a child, it was such an important impact for my childhood. But not only the Krampus. Then there were some other stories about creatures, it was more like an oral history, like a fairy tale or a legend, which had a scary impact as well.
The stories about the Oat Goat, about Frau Berchta, that they open your belly and put dust inside, or your toys, if you don’t clean up your room at night. These figures were also part of some Perchten runs, not in the village Golling where I grew up, more inside the valley; Gastein, Altenmarkt, the Pongau area. I think it creates a big fantasy for a child, when you only hear it and don’t see it.
I was coming to that, that these extraordinary stories and happenings must leave a huge impression when you experience it as a child.
Yeah… somehow you forget it. There are always two separate things that get mixed up here when people talk about it. The Krampus parade, the transformation of the devil, which accompanies Sankt Nikolaus. That is very organised. In our childhood, they “only” came to your house to visit. There were some events, but now there’s like these big parties and Krampus events in every little town. Also like the christmas season itself, the Krampus got extended into one week before and after the actual day of the 5th of December — if not even longer.
But I think we maybe suffered a little more, because it was very intimate situations. That you are in your protected family house, then these guys enter your house and.. (laughs) that was very frightening for me. I was so… scared. I don’t remember if I knew that there were persons underneath the masks, at least not when you are three or four years old. But later, of course, when you go to school and everybody talks about it and so.
It was a mix of fun and scare. As kids we used to tease them a little bit, like a game. The days before December 5, the teenagers do the running in the neighbourhood, you tease them. It was a kind of hide-and-seek-game with them. They try to catch you and so.
The parents agree to this, is there some moral lesson they are trying to teach here, or what’s the purpose?
I think, yeah, it’s such a tradition that nobody asks anymore about the reason (laughs). Of course as a child, you begged your parents “please, don’t let them in”. On the other hand, you got a present you know? (laughs). They had like this bag with chocolate, nuts, socks, gloves, things like that. Maybe a little toy.
So first comes Krampus and then Nikolaus, or how is this working?
They come together. But nowadays, the parents can do it differently. Like “just let in Nikolaus”. And everything is arranged of course, a constructed, theatrical situation. Even though it’s a tradition, you have to call them now. In our society it’s not like they go from house to house and knocks anymore, now it’s more organised.
All this stuff, I think, at least in the alpine regions, comes a lot from the Catholic church, from the catechism, the teachings about religion to get a deeper belief and so. And somehow they invented this devil figure, which funnily got independent over the years.
Somebody told me that the Catholic church would only allow the old pagan, pre-christian traditions if they could adapt them somehow to fit their own doctrines.
The scientific standpoint is that you can’t proof exactly how the specific myths came to be. In some cases the church just built new temples over the old places of belief. It is probably like that. I wouldn’t say that these customs are thousands of years old. They are very much contemporary, I think. Created within the last 300–400 years or so.
There is some stuff in there that interests me very much, there is a female figure. Frau Berchta, and she didn’t show up in our childhood. I found it really interesting to do research on this figure later on. As mentioned, it was invented and probably played by monks and later it got somehow a transition to independence, like people used masks and old coats to dress up not to get recognised while begging. Yes, actually the very popular Sternsingen could be the contemporary version to this too. The masked customs turned out quite versatile and different.
Also, it’s a funny mixture of carnival tradition and from the courts, where they had all these super-fancy carnival traditions and masked balls and everything. Then normal people somehow copied this and made their own parties. For example, it’s very obvious and visible that some textiles brought along the Säumerwege which were connected to Venice.
There were some worker unions, especially in Nuremberg. They wanted to have one day of the year where anybody could be the boss, a so-called verkehrte Welt, the opposite world, the servants could be the kings. This is how the carnival tradition started.
So all this traditions and folklore must be a like a rich treasure of stories and ideas for you to be inspired from?
For me it’s very much inspiring because there are so many impacts. As you mentioned in your question earlier, some people think it’s a super old pagan culture, then there’s a scientific point where they say it’s more related to the carnival traditions and the church, then there’s the folkloric side where you created so many things over hundreds of years, that every village has something special to show in the festival season, you know.
Of course it was used for ideological reasons, very notable in the nationalistic movements in the 19th century and later in the NS-propaganda too. Customs always tell you about the time, and its even very easy to create new ones.
So for my work, I collect it, somehow. Research, watch it, I talk to scientists as well.. or I go to the library and read some texts. From this I bring it to the contemporary and try to interpret it in an artistic way. I like to transform it, to deconstruct it, mix it up with other things like popular culture, for example.
I also see these parallells to the visual arts; if you see how they make the costumes, the sewing and stitching, the masks… everything. They even have professional choreographers. I think it’s very much related to the visual arts, or theater artists, directors, performance artists, you know. So I think you kind of share the same passion and you need a lot of time, because you don’t get paid for it. You do it because you love it. And in a way the structure is similar; you also have presentations and exhibitions, stuff like this. There are dates in a year where they show their talent.
I’m also interested in the fact that both sides cannot stand each other. They kind of hate each other.
Which ones?
Yeah, the traditionalists and the contemporary artists. I think they work — maybe not in a research-based way — but in the way of crafting, there are a lot of similarities. I just found it interesting that there’s a really big gap between the two. It’s because “we” are more liberal, “they” are more within the conservative parties, traditionalists, nationalists, to show what your region is about. It has a kind of smell of the past, of something un-moveable.
There is a very big fraction inside them where they don’t allow women to take part of the parades, because of some self-created law… or something. There are many, many things like this. But who is doing the work in the background… ?
Do you engage in a conversation with the traditionalists, as you call them?
Sometimes I am more in between these two fractions, if I’m working with it. I try to avoid to be pedagogical, to be the person who says what is right or wrong. For me it’s important to show, to bring it to another level. To bring it out in the open, so you can read it. In an ambiguous way, I sometimes have to explain my work. It’s not understandable from the very beginning. You might get a feeling that there’s something more to it, like with fairy tales and folklores.
I was getting to that, because for me, with a lot of conceptual art there are often many layers of meaning to understand the message. Can it be frustrating to have to explain the message to an audience, does it bother you?
Me, I am a consumer of other art as well and I like to discover the artworks and that I need more information about the context and so. I enjoy that. I am also happy to explain what I do, to write about it, yeah.
As an example, the shape of the rhomb or diamond is visible very often in my work. It’s a stark symbol and I find it very often in folklorisitic aesthetics as well as in arts and design.
What kind of reactions do you get from an audience, is there any typical reaction that you have recognised?
It’s really different, depending on if you work towards the art scene, where everything is possible and everybody is really open. But not all people are telling you the truth. You can get some compliments, but they are not really honest. It would be a better reaction if it’s happening in an art context.
Generally I’m not getting so much criticism. But when I and some colleagues were doing interviews with people who work in the folklore-scene, we got some agressive tones then. They were not interested in our questions.
Why was it a problem for them, do you think?
First of all, I think they are afraid that you will copy their traditions. They don’t like to get criticised, when you ask them why they exclude women from their performances. They often mention that it’s a “body thing”, that the women cannot wear the heavy masks. They can sometimes have hats weighing 20 kilos or so… but there are other figures without heavy masks, so…
You think it’s about misogyny?
Yeah… we did this other project in an art in public-context, and got together people from the village to a podium. It was part of the Medicine Mountain project. There was a Salzburg version and a Tyrol version. Both were research-based projects and also included a video performance.
Before we started to film the video performance, we invited experts to talk; about the region, cultures and so. Plus it was open to everyone. Therefore we created a so-called Meeting Mountain. It looked like a baldachin and was carried by ourselves. We had a press release, we told the villagers that they are welcome to talk with the expert, or with us at the podium, like a speaker’s corner.
So people from the village showed up and they were really angry about it. Also, I didn’t know that in Imst, Tyrol, they organize a children’s and a grown-up’s version of the Imster Schemenlaufen every two years. I was really shocked that the girls are not allowed to take part of this. I imagine if I would be a girl in this town, I would go mad. I mean why? They have this dances, it’s a huge event… it’s also protected from the Unesco now, registered as a Intangible Cultural Heritage in Austria.
But if you understand the dialect its quite clear: Buabefasnacht!
You then teach the children that this is a tradition, but what does it mean? You see that your brothers are allowed to join… really weird. I was really happy that people showed up and asked these questions at least. And the guy who organised the laufen was really cool about it. It was interesting for me to see how he was reacting to it. He didn’t see much of a problem to it… and to us, for our artproject he was so helpful, he even allowed us to do what we want in the museum.
There’s also the question, like when you’re a village guy, or an immigrant from a foreign country; is it open for them too… ? Because you’re not really from the village. Probably, this is all changing now.
So the podium you organised was it an effort to change the way people are thinking about this stuff?
It was in the format of “making things possible”. Not in the political sense, like a Gemeinderat, a political gathering in villages where you can complain about stuff… our way was more like creating an atmosphere. Of course, we wanted them to get more into the practices of our art; like how a movie set is created, you know?
And girls were welcome?
Everybody was welcome (laughs). But this was the part that didn’t work, only the part with the discussion, maybe it was just not interesting performing with us, I don’t know.
Is performing your main way of expressing yourself in art? You’re also busy with illustrations, collage, installations, videos…and mix them into a kind of holistic experience?
I think so. “Collage” sounds so old-fashioned somehow. For me, collage is a perfect way of dealing with different layers of subjects. To divide it and split it, you know, mix it up. Even if I do other things, I use the traditional collage very often as a starting point, or parallell to my work.
With photographs I made from these parades, from nature, collected material from newspapers, drawings I made, paintings, I mix it all.
It’s a starting point, but it’s also ongoing, parallell. Right now I’m working on installations in Salzburg and Germany… it’s all of the different medias coming together in one atmosphere, to one room, the room I am creating.
Maybe you can call it three-dimensional collages as well. I use the medium of video/film, I use the performance part to re-enact, like a dance scene in a choreographic way. I also make re-enactments with photos. And there’s a sculpture/object point, which is very important. For the first time, I will produce curtains as well. They all come together in my installations.
You are often using your own persona in the center of the artwork.
I don’t know if I’m in the center. Maybe I’m around… (laughs).
How important is the geographic context in the art piece? Is location as important as the other components? I’m thinking about Meeting Mountain, for example.
Yeah, I like to work site-specific. And it’s a little bit difficult for me to work in Vienna. I think sometimes people in Vienna don’t exactly understand what I’m doing. Maybe they don’t know it, or they didn’t grew up like this. And I have this impression that, if I for example talk about the mask customs, people always think you are talking about the devil. They only think about the Krampus… the guys with the fur. But this is maybe the smallest part of my work. I’m mostly interested in the other figures – Schönperchten – which were created around the female figure, Frau Berchta. You can find it in hundreds of different forms, figures, costumes…
So, for me, it helps me for my work in these areas where they have these traditions. In Salzburg I experienced that people got some other feeling for it than people in Vienna. It was very interesting at my degree show, which was based on the figure of Frau Berchta. All the questions from the jury, they were always asking about this other figure, you know? Anyway I am very much looking forward to present new works in Vienna too.
Also when I do artists in residence-programs I’m always interested in the region I am visiting. What’s happening there, how people dress up, costume-plays, traditional festivals, what dances they have. It’s a kind of old-fashioned field research trip.
A bit anthropological maybe?
Yeah, but that’s also from a contemporary point of view. Maybe everyone is doing it anyway. Somehow you always look, how you can compare things. You discover a lot of interesting stuff, it’s very inspiring.
It’s also nice to see historical photographs of customs, there’s a really big attraction to it, I think. Also you can see the poorness, they just used what material they had available. Compared to today you see this gap, you have the welfare state. The countryside of Salzburg is really rich, people are rich… not like millionaires, but you can see it. It’s all so perfectly-ish made everything somehow.
So these old traditions turned out to be super-events, also for tourists. I think that’s an important part of this, to make your region more interesting, like advertising. And it´s very popular to create new old customs as well, found in records about the region. In Golling a new Perchtenplay was inventend in the 1990's… so finally the figures I imagined as a child became true…
It doesn’t sound so bad, I think. That old traditions finds a place in modern times. Even if it’s commercial.
That’s true. There’s also another movement where people are hiding themselves, to get away from this touristic stuff. Even visitors, you know. They don’t like so much when people are coming and watching, so they want to keep it for themselves, they distance themselves from the event culture, don’t even tell the newspapers about it, but the farms they pay a visit.
Working as a performance artist… you put your own person out directly to the public eye. Does this make you feel vulnerable or nervous in some way? That you are the artwork itself.
Well, first I have to say, I’m not doing live performances so often anymore. I used to do it quite a lot. I’m more into video performances. Even if you’re not doing live performances, you will always be vulnerable, you will be scared somehow. But if you do a live performance in a funny way you can hide yourself… so you’re not really present. When you are doing it, you are the art piece and nobody can ask questions.
You always forget it, somehow. But I don’t like the time before doing a performance. It’s not something I enjoy. It’s the same with presentations. I recently did a presentation in Medienwerkstatt Wien in the lecture format, in a kind of PechaKucha-format. Even there, before I was to make the presentation, I was uncomfortable. But then, once you start, it always works out somehow and you feel better afterwards.
I’m not a professional, I have to say also. I don’t have any acting techniques or so. I also very much see the performance art different from acting. With performance art we are not doing any rehearsals, it’s more about talking about something and creating a scenery. But it’s not that I don’t like it!
You consider yourself to be a performance artist, or are labels irrelevant?
I do care about it, but I’m a little bit surprised that some people think I’m a performance artist, I would never describe myself as that (laughs). This is really funny. It’s not a problem for me, I’m just so surprised. Most of my time, I’m doing a collage, I’m cutting a video or creating installations… so it’s the part I give the least shit about (laughs) but which is the most recognisable for others, I don’t know.
And maybe my performances are mostly visible when I am performing together with Peter (Kozek), than of my works as a solo artist. Anyway, I am planning now a performance-based project for later on, probably together with Peter. But for my solo works the performance part are maybe more visible as the re-enactments I am doing on video.
It’s funny how language, or descriptions can make one thing more important than the other things. Very interesting.
You and Peter work together and separately. How do you go about your working process when you want to do a project together. Is it planned out, or more organic?
It’s organic in the way of how the projects come in or like how our focus is. For one or two years, we were both concentrated on our respective works, our solo things. Peter is also working as a curator and scenography and set designs for other exhibitions. But we did a research trip together this year to Japan. We got a nice scholarship from the Bundesministerium which allowed us to do research in Japan.
We were very much interested in the traditional Japanese arts. This was in Tokyo, but with a Japan rail pass you can easily travel around in the country, to different regions, it’s very comfortable with the Shinkansen.
We were very much inspired by the so-called Noh theater. I think it’s very related to a religious way of performing. It’s like a minimalistic opera, only three instruments and a choir. Very minimalistic stage design. Not only, but mainly they use masks. Very rich costumes.
That’s also organic, in the way we work… we cannot see the impact of what will come when we are doing this stuff. It’s a starting point for us, to do new works from this Japanese research trip. There were different kind of festivals there every day, they call it Matsuri. It’s like summer festivals, mostly dances and showing different skills, also hanabi, the fireworks.
All very beautiful things.

During my teenage years, I had the privilege of visiting Vienna on a school trip, a journey that left an indelible mark on my young imagination.
The snow-covered landscapes, the shimmering lakes, and the crystalline beauty of ice captivated me entirely. These scenes became the seeds of inspiration for my poem Smell of Austria.
In this composition, I sought to capture the essence of those unforgettable moments: the serene beauty of nature, the crisp air, and the profound sense of wonder I felt while standing amidst such grandeur. Writing this poem was my way of preserving that magic, a tribute to Austria’s timeless charm.I invite you to read it and immerse yourself in its imagery:
Smell of Austria
Cloud of cream amid snow’s torrents, on a glassy lake, a prison of ice.
Cries through the peaks, sharp Aeolus, strokes a pale green, the wintry bed of slumbering spring.
Amid ruthless storms and whispers of frost, hidden awaits the goddess Flora, with her frozen heart.
If it resonates with you, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What emotions does it evoke? What memories does it awaken? Please share your impressions in the comments below.
If you enjoy this poem and would like to read more of my work, consider following me here on Medium.
Your support means the world to me and inspires me to keep sharing my poetic journey.
Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the read!

E & H & E decided to ride bicycles from Krakow through Slovakia to Vienna. And… why not? Seems like a lovely part of the world. I imagine that much of our bicycling will be across landscapes like below (a painting by Slovakian artist Peter Stronsky).
So my bicycle is prepared, meaning it has a new chain and brake pads and tires and everything is shiny and clean. I have arranged the ideal configuration of beautiful bags to attach to my bike. I have chosen the things I am taking by imagining where I’ll be and what I’ll be doing: sitting in a cozy B&B in the mountains (sweatshirt, light pants), walking around Krakow and Vienna (dresses), riding through the rain (rain jacket, anticipated sadness), riding through the sunshine (cowboy shirt, anticipated glee).
Am I ready? Who knows! But I’ll face this self-prescribed challenge with two friends, Emily and Hilary. Emily and I have been on several bike rides before, through Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Italy, and places in the US. We like to obsessively map routes and talk about bicycle bags. In Europe, we seek out our favorite things (Emily: traditional hay fields and karst landscapes; Erin: abandoned castles and not-abandoned village squares; both: old forests and locally-made liqueurs). Hilary is a new addition to the team, willing to travel to places and just see what happens. Go Team EHE!

I’m providing a little “loadout” for each city, so you’ll know what cameras and lenses were used. Like a table of contents so you’ll know from the start if a lens or camera you care about ends up in the collection. If I no longer use a certain camera, it’ll be noted. Also if I’ve previously written a review of that lens, it will be linked in the contents.
If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment or direct message me on IG @foxfotoco , I’ll happily respond to anyone!
